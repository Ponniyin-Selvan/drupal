</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Over the course of lot of these discussions on historical records <br />and their availability - we are talking of 7th C and 10th C stuff <br />here....below is an account of what happened much much nearer..how <br />much do we know about it...</p>
<p>I was reading through the online edition of the hindu couple of <br />weeks ago and chanced on this interesting link - its on the border <br />dispute between india and pakistan ....check out the quality of <br />response from the baroness of belgium</p>
<p>this is the initial letter from the ambassador </p>
<p><a href="http://www.hindu.com/nic/ambassadorletter.pdf" title="http://www.hindu.com/nic/ambassadorletter.pdf">http://www.hindu.com/nic/ambassadorletter.pdf</a></p>
<p>and the gem from the baroness</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hindu.com/nic/baronessresponse.pdf" title="http://www.hindu.com/nic/baronessresponse.pdf">http://www.hindu.com/nic/baronessresponse.pdf</a></p>
<p>I am reminded of one of my fav books - Freedom at midnight and a few <br />things which we do not get to see in our history books</p>
<p>Freedom at Midnight is a book by Dominique Lapierre and Larry <br />Collins. It describes the events in the Indian independence movement <br />in 1947-48, beginning with the appointment of Lord Mountbatten as <br />the last viceroy of British India, and ending with the death and <br />funeral of Mahatma Gandhi. this book contains a lot of bare ( gory) <br />facts - and makes you look at a lot of our father figures in new <br />light ( incl the mahatma, nehru, patel). there are also interesting <br />accounts of Jinnah...incidentally this book is banned in pakisthan...</p>
<p>The authors having interviewed many of those who were there, <br />including Lord Mountbatten, the book gives a detailed account of the <br />last year of British India, the princely states' reactions to <br />independence, the partition of India and Pakistan, and the bloodshed <br />that followed. It also covers the events leading to the <br />assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The book is a result of deeply <br />scanned and researched events which often are left out by the <br />historians. The maps of India and Pakistan were drawn on religious <br />grounds by a man named Cyril Radcliffe who had never visited India <br />in his life. The book also explains the fury of both Hindus and <br />Muslims, misled by their communal leaders, during the partition and <br />the biggest mass slaughter in the history of India - more people <br />lost their lives in this painful year than the two world wars put <br />together...</p>
<p>why i quote this book is that,the letter of assession and the <br />situation leading to raja Hari singh signing it are clearly outlined <br />in the book...</p>
<p>The Raja did not want to accede either to india or to pakisthan but <br />wanted to remain independant. Pakisthan wanted to get kashmir by <br />force - but couldnt afford an outright war - hence they covertly <br />armed afridis ( mujahideen??)from the north west frontier province <br />and let them a free hand to ran sack kashmir and thereby intimidate <br />the king to accede to pakisthan....they were successful and the band <br />of gun men were just a few miles from the only servicable airport in <br />srinagar ......</p>
<p>Lord mountbatten refused to send troops into kashmir till the king <br />signed the assession - Mr. menon meets with the king takes the <br />signed copy an flies back to delhi late evening( no night flights <br />those days)...the raja goes to sleep telling his aide not to wake <br />him up if indian army doesnt arrive by day break and instead shoot <br />him in his sleep.....</p>
<p>the gunmen are hours away from securing the airport when they come <br />across a christian mission with 13 foreign nuns and spend the night <br />committing .......and fail to reach the airport...</p>
<p>indian <acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym force plane lands in srinagar at 4.45 am and are <br />successfull in beating back the gunmen.....thus kashmir came to <br />india. go back and read the letter from Raja Hari singh now</acronym></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hindu.com/nic/baronessresponse.pdf" title="http://www.hindu.com/nic/baronessresponse.pdf">http://www.hindu.com/nic/baronessresponse.pdf</a></p>
<p>this happened on 26th Oct 1947. How many of us are aware of these, <br />in this age of advanced information exchange... makes you look back <br />at the copper grants and culverts with new respect...</p>

<p>    Do you know why we got freedom at midnight? 15th August alright, <br />  but why did<br />    it have to be the stroke of midnight? It never stuck me as odd - <br />  but after<br />    all, Pakistan got its freedom during daylight! why should our <br />  independence<br />    be gotten at midnight?</p>
<p>    I didnt realize the difference until I got a gleaning from <br />  today's 'The<br />    Hindu'</p>
<p>    Interesting bit of new taken from today's hindu (<br />    <a href="http://www.hindu.com/af/india60/stories/2007081551020400.htm" title="http://www.hindu.com/af/india60/stories/2007081551020400.htm">http://www.hindu.com/af/india60/stories/2007081551020400.htm</a>) <br />for <br />  your<br />    reading:</p>
<p>    The British Government had decided that the transfer of power to <br />  India, as<br />    represented by the Constituent Assembly should take place on the <br />  15th of<br />    August. The British do not consult astrologers when they take <br />  political<br />    decisions, but there were quite a few eminent personages in <br />Delhi <br />  who<br />    believed (many of them still do) in the effect of stellar <br />  combinations on<br />    human affairs and some of them began consulting astrologers as <br />to <br />  whether<br />    the 15th was an auspicious day for the occasion. The advice was <br />  that it was<br />    not; a far more auspicious day was the 14th. But this was the <br />day <br />  fixed for<br />    the renunciation of British authority over Pakistan and in fact, <br />  Lord<br />    Mountbatten, the Viceroy, was in Karachi that morning formally <br />to <br />  announce<br />    the transfer of power to that country and he flew back to Delhi <br />  the same<br />    afternoon. A solution for the problem was discovered, to the <br />best <br />  of my<br />    recollection, by the agile brain of Sardar K. M. Panikkar, a <br />  brilliant<br />    writer of history in the English language, a scholar in <br />Malayalam, <br />  also a<br />    deep student of the more recondite features of Hindu religion, <br />and <br />  withal a<br />    great wit. He said he had discovered a formula which would <br />appease <br />  the stars<br />    as well as make it unnecessary for the British government to <br />  change the date<br />    which had been announced in Parliament. The members of the <br />  Constituent<br />    Assembly would meet on the 14th, about half-an-hour or so before <br />  midnight;     this would propitiate the stars. They would, however, take the <br />  oath of<br />    allegiance to Free India after the stroke of midnight which, <br />  according to<br />    British recognition, would be the 15th. Everybody seemed <br />satisfied <br />  and<br />    arrangements were made accordingly.</p>

<p>      hi sir,</p>

<p>      text of the speech</p>
<p>      Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time <br />  comes<br />      when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full <br />measure, <br />  but<br />      very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when <br />the<br />      world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment <br />  comes,<br />      which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the <br />old <br />  to<br />      the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of the nation, <br />long<br />      suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn<br />      moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of <br />India <br />  and<br />      her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.</p>
<p>      At the dawn of history India started on her unending quest, and<br />      trackless centuries are filled with her striving and the <br />  grandeur of<br />      her success and her failures. Through good and ill fortune <br />alike <br />  she<br />      has never lost sight of that quest or forgotten the ideals <br />which<br />      gave her strength. We end today a period of ill fortune and <br />India<br />      discovers herself again. The achievement we celebrate today is <br />  but a<br />      step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and<br />      achievements that await us. Are we brave enough and wise <br />enough <br />  to<br />      grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?</p>
<p>      Freedom and power bring responsibility. The responsibility <br />rests<br />      upon this Assembly, a sovereign body representing the sovereign<br />      people of India. Before the birth of freedom we have endured <br />all <br />  the<br />      pains of labour and our hearts are heavy with the memory of the<br />      sorrow. Some of those pains continue even now. Nevertheless, <br />the<br />      past is over and it is the future that beckons to us now.</p>
<p>      That future is not one of ease or resting but of incessant <br />  striving<br />      so that we might fulfil the pledges we have so often taken and <br />  the<br />      one we shall take today. The service of India means the <br />service <br />  of<br />      the millions who suffer. It means the ending of poverty and<br />      ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. The <br />  ambition of<br />      the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear <br />  from<br />      every eye. That may be beyond us, but as long as there are <br />tears <br />  and<br />      suffering, so long our work will not be over.</p>
<p>      And so we have to labour and to work, and work hard to give <br />  reality<br />      to our dreams. Those dreams are for India, but they are also <br />for <br />  the<br />      world, for all the nations and peoples are too closely knit <br />  together<br />      today for any one of them to imagine that it can live apart. <br />  Peace<br />      has been said to be indivisible; so is freedom, so is <br />prosperity<br />      now, and so also a disaster in this One World that can no <br />longer <br />  be<br />      split into isolated fragments.</p>
<p>      To the people of India, whose representatives we are, we make <br />an<br />      appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great <br />  adventure.<br />      This is no time for petty and destructive criticism, no time <br />for <br />  ill<br />      will or blaming others. We have to build the noble mansion of <br />  free<br />      India where all her children may dwell.</p>
<p>      I beg to move, Sir, that it be resolved that:</p>
<p>      (I) After the last stroke of midnight, all members of the<br />      Constituent Assembly present on this occasion do take the <br />  following<br />      pledge: 'At this solemn moment when the people of India, <br />through<br />      suffering and sacrifice, have secured freedom, I, ..., a <br />member <br />  of<br />      the Constituent Assembly of India, do dedicate myself in all<br />      humility to the service of India and her people to the end <br />that <br />  this<br />      ancient land attain her rightful place in the world and make <br />her<br />      full and willing contribution to the promotion of world peace <br />and<br />      the welfare of mankind';      <br />      (2) Members who are not present on this occasion do take the <br />  pledge<br />      (with such verbal changes as the President may prescribe) at <br />the<br />      time they next attend a session of the Assembly.</p>

<p>  The British Government had decided that the transfer of power to <br />India, as<br />  represented by the Constituent Assembly should take place on the <br />15th of<br />  August. The British do not consult astrologers when they take <br />political<br />  decisions, but there were quite a few eminent personages in Delhi <br />who<br />  believed (many of them still do) in the effect of stellar <br />combinations on<br />  human affairs and some of them began consulting astrologers as to <br />whether<br />  the 15th was an auspicious day for the occasion. The advice was <br />that it was<br />  not; a far more auspicious day was the 14th. But this was the day <br />fixed for<br />  the renunciation of British authority over Pakistan and in fact, <br />Lord<br />  Mountbatten, the Viceroy, was in Karachi that morning formally to <br />announce<br />  the transfer of power to that country and he flew back to Delhi <br />the same<br />  afternoon. A solution for the problem was discovered, to the best <br />of my<br />  recollection, by the agile brain of Sardar K. M.

<p>    text of the speech</p>
<p>    Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time <br />comes<br />    when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, <br />but<br />    very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the<br />    world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment <br />comes,<br />    which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old <br />to<br />    the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of the nation, long<br />    suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn<br />    moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India <br />and<br />    her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.</p>
<p>    At the dawn of history India started on her unending quest, and<br />    trackless centuries are filled with her striving and the <br />grandeur of<br />    her success and her failures. Through good and ill fortune alike <br />she<br />    has never lost sight of that quest or forgotten the ideals which<br />    gave her strength. We end today a period of ill fortune and India<br />    discovers herself again. The achievement we celebrate today is <br />but a<br />    step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and<br />    achievements that await us. Are we brave enough and wise enough <br />to<br />    grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?</p>
<p>    Freedom and power bring responsibility. The responsibility rests<br />    upon this Assembly, a sovereign body representing the sovereign<br />    people of India. Before the birth of freedom we have endured all <br />the<br />    pains of labour and our hearts are heavy with the memory of the<br />    sorrow. Some of those pains continue even now. Nevertheless, the<br />    past is over and it is the future that beckons to us now.</p>
<p>    That future is not one of ease or resting but of incessant <br />striving<br />    so that we might fulfil the pledges we have so often taken and <br />the<br />    one we shall take today. The service of India means the service <br />of<br />    the millions who suffer. It means the ending of poverty and<br />    ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. The <br />ambition of<br />    the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear <br />from<br />    every eye. That may be beyond us, but as long as there are tears <br />and<br />    suffering, so long our work will not be over.</p>
<p>    And so we have to labour and to work, and work hard to give <br />reality<br />    to our dreams. Those dreams are for India, but they are also for <br />the<br />    world, for all the nations and peoples are too closely knit <br />together<br />    today for any one of them to imagine that it can live apart. <br />Peace<br />    has been said to be indivisible; so is freedom, so is prosperity<br />    now, and so also a disaster in this One World that can no longer <br />be<br />    split into isolated fragments.</p>
<p>    To the people of India, whose representatives we are, we make an<br />    appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great <br />adventure.<br />    This is no time for petty and destructive criticism, no time for <br />ill<br />    will or blaming others. We have to build the noble mansion of <br />free<br />    India where all her children may dwell.</p>
<p>    I beg to move, Sir, that it be resolved that:</p>
<p>    (I) After the last stroke of midnight, all members of the<br />    Constituent Assembly present on this occasion do take the <br />following<br />    pledge: 'At this solemn moment when the people of India, through<br />    suffering and sacrifice, have secured freedom, I, ..., a member <br />of<br />    the Constituent Assembly of India, do dedicate myself in all<br />    humility to the service of India and her people to the end that <br />this<br />    ancient land attain her rightful place in the world and make her<br />    full and willing contribution to the promotion of world peace and<br />    the welfare of mankind';    <br />    (2) Members who are not present on this occasion do take the <br />pledge<br />    (with such verbal changes as the President may prescribe) at the<br />    time they next attend a session of the Assembly.</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is true - this is also the reason why Pakistan got theirs on <br />14th - a day ahead of us.  </p>
<p>You can read more on these and why the exact date was picked by <br />Mountbatten in the book Freedom at midnight - when the viceroy took <br />charge with a specific agenda by the crown to go ahead with the <br />release of india, he got questioned on when he would handover <br />charge ...and he gave the first date that came to his mind - the day <br />where he scored his major success against the invading japanese <br />forces - during his tenure as the commander of the british forces in <br />the far east - which he thought was his favorite month/day. </p>
<p>There is speculation to this day as to if the viceroy did this is <br />haste - the famous Mountbatten Plan was drafted and the actual <br />division between the two new dominions was taken on 3rd June.The <br />border between India and Pakistan was determined by Sir Cyril <br />Radcliffe, who had very little time to survey the actual land border <br />to assess the physical boundries - dykes, lakes and canals etc. He <br />had to depend on outdated land records and instead of the clinical <br />strike of a surgeons scalpel - he used a butchers strike to cut <br />through...</p>
<p>But more startling facts are revealed in the book, that Md Jinnah <br />was ailing from acute TB ( having very little time left to live) and <br />this information was kept secret even from the british secret <br />service...Mountbatten himself stated later that had he known of <br />this,he might have delayed the partition and ......</p>
<p>More startling facts the assassination of mahatma and how the <br />investigations preceeding the actual shooting and the laxity of the <br />government/police machinery and dealt with in graphical detail in <br />this book - a must read. not for the faint hearted.</p>

<p>    text of the speech</p>
<p>    Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time <br />comes<br />    when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, <br />but<br />    very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the<br />    world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment <br />comes,<br />    which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old <br />to<br />    the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of the nation, long<br />    suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn<br />    moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India <br />and<br />    her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.</p>
<p>    At the dawn of history India started on her unending quest, and<br />    trackless centuries are filled with her striving and the <br />grandeur of<br />    her success and her failures. Through good and ill fortune alike <br />she<br />    has never lost sight of that quest or forgotten the ideals which<br />    gave her strength. We end today a period of ill fortune and India<br />    discovers herself again. The achievement we celebrate today is <br />but a<br />    step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and<br />    achievements that await us. Are we brave enough and wise enough <br />to<br />    grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?</p>
<p>    Freedom and power bring responsibility. The responsibility rests<br />    upon this Assembly, a sovereign body representing the sovereign<br />    people of India. Before the birth of freedom we have endured all <br />the<br />    pains of labour and our hearts are heavy with the memory of the<br />    sorrow. Some of those pains continue even now. Nevertheless, the<br />    past is over and it is the future that beckons to us now.</p>
<p>    That future is not one of ease or resting but of incessant <br />striving<br />    so that we might fulfil the pledges we have so often taken and <br />the<br />    one we shall take today. The service of India means the service <br />of<br />    the millions who suffer. It means the ending of poverty and<br />    ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. The <br />ambition of<br />    the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear <br />from<br />    every eye. That may be beyond us, but as long as there are tears <br />and<br />    suffering, so long our work will not be over.</p>
<p>    And so we have to labour and to work, and work hard to give <br />reality<br />    to our dreams. Those dreams are for India, but they are also for <br />the<br />    world, for all the nations and peoples are too closely knit <br />together<br />    today for any one of them to imagine that it can live apart. <br />Peace<br />    has been said to be indivisible; so is freedom, so is prosperity<br />    now, and so also a disaster in this One World that can no longer <br />be<br />    split into isolated fragments.</p>
<p>    To the people of India, whose representatives we are, we make an<br />    appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great <br />adventure.<br />    This is no time for petty and destructive criticism, no time for <br />ill<br />    will or blaming others. We have to build the noble mansion of <br />free<br />    India where all her children may dwell.</p>
<p>    I beg to move, Sir, that it be resolved that:</p>
<p>    (I) After the last stroke of midnight, all members of the<br />    Constituent Assembly present on this occasion do take the <br />following<br />    pledge: 'At this solemn moment when the people of India, through<br />    suffering and sacrifice, have secured freedom, I, ..., a member <br />of<br />    the Constituent Assembly of India, do dedicate myself in all<br />    humility to the service of India and her people to the end that <br />this<br />    ancient land attain her rightful place in the world and make her<br />    full and willing contribution to the promotion of world peace and<br />    the welfare of mankind';    <br />    (2) Members who are not present on this occasion do take the <br />pledge<br />    (with such verbal changes as the President may prescribe) at the<br />    time they next attend a session of the Assembly.</p>

The achievement we celebrate today is but a<br />  step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and<br />  achievements that await us. Are we brave enough and wise enough to<br />  grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?</p>
<p>  Freedom and power bring responsibility. The responsibility rests<br />  upon this Assembly, a sovereign body representing the sovereign<br />  people of India. Before the birth of freedom we have endured all the<br />  pains of labour and our hearts are heavy with the memory of the<br />  sorrow. Some of those pains continue even now. Nevertheless, the<br />  past is over and it is the future that beckons to us now.</p>
<p>  That future is not one of ease or resting but of incessant striving<br />  so that we might fulfil the pledges we have so often taken and the<br />  one we shall take today. The service of India means the service of<br />  the millions who suffer. It means the ending of poverty and<br />  ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. The ambition of<br />  the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear from<br />  every eye. That may be beyond us, but as long as there are tears and<br />  suffering, so long our work will not be over.</p>
<p>  And so we have to labour and to work, and work hard to give reality<br />  to our dreams. Those dreams are for India, but they are also for the<br />  world, for all the nations and peoples are too closely knit together<br />  today for any one of them to imagine that it can live apart. Peace<br />  has been said to be indivisible; so is freedom, so is prosperity<br />  now, and so also a disaster in this One World that can no longer be<br />  split into isolated fragments.</p>
<p>  To the people of India, whose representatives we are, we make an<br />  appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great adventure.<br />  This is no time for petty and destructive criticism, no time for ill<br />  will or blaming others. We have to build the noble mansion of free<br />  India where all her children may dwell.</p>
<p>  I beg to move, Sir, that it be resolved that:</p>
<p>  (I) After the last stroke of midnight, all members of the<br />  Constituent Assembly present on this occasion do take the following<br />  pledge: 'At this solemn moment when the people of India, through<br />  suffering and sacrifice, have secured freedom, I, ..., a member of<br />  the Constituent Assembly of India, do dedicate myself in all<br />  humility to the service of India and her people to the end that this<br />  ancient land attain her rightful place in the world and make her<br />  full and willing contribution to the promotion of world peace and<br />  the welfare of mankind';  <br />  (2) Members who are not present on this occasion do take the pledge<br />  (with such verbal changes as the President may prescribe) at the<br />  time they next attend a session of the Assembly.</p>

        <p>Hi<br />I visited the Roja muthiah library today to do some research on <br />pudukottai.<br />there was this book called "The Pudukkottai State Manual " published <br />by the brihadamba state press of kingdom of pudukottai.</p>
<p>to my great joy i discovered that the book had been presented to K.A. <br />Nilakanta sastri by the author and Sastri himself had written his <br />name in the first page.<br />perhaps it came to RMRL from sastri's private collection</p>

<p>  Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes <br />  when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but <br />  very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the <br />  world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, <br />  which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to <br />  the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of the nation, long <br />  suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn <br />  moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and <br />  her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.</p>
<p>  At the dawn of history India started on her unending quest, and <br />  trackless centuries are filled with her striving and the grandeur <br />of <br />  her success and her failures.

<p>  I am reminded of one of my fav books - Freedom at midnight and a <br />few <br />  things which we do not get to see in our history books</p>
<p>  Freedom at Midnight is a book by Dominique Lapierre and Larry <br />  Collins. It describes the events in the Indian independence <br />movement <br />  in 1947-48, beginning with the appointment of Lord Mountbatten as <br />  the last viceroy of British India, and ending with the death and <br />  funeral of Mahatma Gandhi. this book contains a lot of bare ( <br />gory) <br />  facts - and makes you look at a lot of our father figures in new <br />  light ( incl the mahatma, nehru, patel). there are also <br />interesting <br />  accounts of Jinnah...incidentally this book is banned in <br />pakisthan...</p>
<p>  The authors having interviewed many of those who were there, <br />  including Lord Mountbatten, the book gives a detailed account of <br />the <br />  last year of British India, the princely states' reactions to <br />  independence, the partition of India and Pakistan, and the <br />bloodshed <br />  that followed. It also covers the events leading to the <br />  assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The book is a result of deeply <br />  scanned and researched events which often are left out by the <br />  historians. The maps of India and Pakistan were drawn on religious <br />  grounds by a man named Cyril Radcliffe who had never visited India <br />  in his life. The book also explains the fury of both Hindus and <br />  Muslims, misled by their communal leaders, during the partition <br />and <br />  the biggest mass slaughter in the history of India - more people <br />  lost their lives in this painful year than the two world wars put <br />  together...</p>
<p>  why i quote this book is that,the letter of assession and the <br />  situation leading to raja Hari singh signing it are clearly <br />outlined <br />  in the book...</p>
<p>  The Raja did not want to accede either to india or to pakisthan <br />but <br />  wanted to remain independant. Pakisthan wanted to get kashmir by <br />  force - but couldnt afford an outright war - hence they covertly <br />  armed afridis ( mujahideen??)from the north west frontier province <br />  and let them a free hand to ran sack kashmir and thereby <br />intimidate <br />  the king to accede to pakisthan....they were successful and the <br />band <br />  of gun men were just a few miles from the only servicable airport <br />in <br />  srinagar ......</p>
<p>  Lord mountbatten refused to send troops into kashmir till the king <br />  signed the assession - Mr. menon meets with the king takes the <br />  signed copy an flies back to delhi late evening( no night flights <br />  those days)...the raja goes to sleep telling his aide not to wake <br />  him up if indian army doesnt arrive by day break and instead shoot <br />  him in his sleep.....</p>
<p>  the gunmen are hours away from securing the airport when they come <br />  across a christian mission with 13 foreign nuns and spend the <br />night <br />  committing .......and fail to reach the airport...</p>
<p>  indian air force plane lands in srinagar at 4.45 am and are <br />  successfull in beating back the gunmen.....thus kashmir came to <br />  india. go back and read the letter from Raja Hari singh now</p>

<p>Pamela Mountbatten on the Jawaharlal-Edwina relationship </p>
<p>...In your book you write: “my mother had already had lovers, my <br />father was inured to it” but then you add, “the relationship with <br />Nehru remained platonic.” Can you be really sure of that?</p>
<p>...Much of this friendship and affection, much of this relationship, <br />actually lived its way in the letters they wrote each other. You <br />reveal in your book that Pandit Nehru wrote to your mother <br />practically every night at 2 o’ clock. </p>
<p>..There is another aspect of this relationship that you refer to in <br />your book. You say that the Edwina-Nehru relationship was also of <br />use to your father as Viceroy. That he often appealed to Panditji <br />through the influence your mother had. And that this was <br />particularly useful handling tricky situations like Kashmir. </p>
