</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Was reading a book and it was mentioned that the use of gunpowder<br />spread to Europe in the 12th-13th centuries (possibly after Marco<br />Polo?). Anyway, since India or at least the South had much more<br />extensive contacts with the Chinese, how early did the South Indians<br />(Chozhas, Pandyas etc) start using gunpowder? What is the earliest<br />recorded work talking about the use of gunpowder? Does<br />Kalingaththuparani talk about it?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

        <p>there is sufficient info about malik if you are obsessed with him</p>
<p>historians of those days were sychophants too.</p>
<p>they record him in glorious terms when he was in good books of the <br />sultan and then defile him when he is not.</p>
<p>malik remains today the greatest warrior in terms of territory <br />conquered for the first time. the later muslim kings were beating <br />dead snakes.</p>

<p>      First Tamil ruler in History to seek support from<br />    Malik's gang!</p>
<p>    we all under estimate malik kafur<br />    he would have attacked madurai even without sundar a<br />    pandyas help<br />    and there is evidence to suggest sundara deserted<br />    malik much ahead of <br />    madurai,</p>
<p>    if you need to blame some body its the hoysalas vir<br />    ballala and co <br />    who offered logistic support to malik to settle<br />    scores with the <br />    pandyas.</p>

<p>    Hi Arun</p>
<p>    collected some info</p>
<p>    An early record of gunpowder, is in a Chinese book<br />    from c. 850 A.D. <br />    called "Classified Essentials of the Mysterious<br />  Tao<br />    of the True <br />    Origin of Things," indicates that gunpowder was a<br />    byproduct of Taoist <br />    alchemical efforts to develop an elixir of<br />    immortality.</p>
<p>    funny no?</p>
<p>    immortality and death.</p>
<p>    The Chinese first seem to have used gunpowder in<br />    warfare in 904 A.D., <br />    as incendiary projectiles called "flying fires."<br />    (These were invented <br />    during the Tang Dynasty and were originally used<br />  for<br />    fireworks.)</p>
<p>    The important step was to use gunpowder as a<br />    propellant. The first <br />    such use was recorded in 1132 in experiments with<br />    mortars consisting <br />    of bamboo tubes. Mortars with metal tubes (made of<br />    iron or bronze) <br />    first appeared in the wars (1268-1279) between the<br />    Mongols and the <br />    Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>    so some parallel usage during chola times also.</p>

<p>      Wow Venketesh... thanks for that bit of info. I<br />    too had read that<br />      Babur had introduced canons to India. But I<br />  still<br />    find it really<br />      funny... If the Cholas had such extensive<br />  contacts<br />    with the Chinese,<br />      how come they never got to use gunpowder? Or<br />  even<br />    a mention of it?<br />      Seems very strange to say the least.</p>

<p>        as far as I know it was babar who brought gun<br />    powder inside india.</p>
<p>        the period between 1508 and 1519 the Ottoman<br />    Empire's new weapon,<br />        the matchlock musket was seen in warfare.<br />        Babur, it appears, was swift in acquiring<br />  this<br />    new technology for<br />        himself.<br />        Somewhere during these years Babur introduced<br />    matchlocks into his<br />        army, and allowed an Ottoman, Ustad Ali, to<br />    train his troops, who<br />        were then known as Matchlockmen, in their<br />  use.<br />    Babur's memoirs <br />    give<br />        accounts of battles where the opposition<br />  forces<br />    mocked his <br />    troops,<br />        never having seen a gun before, because of<br />  the<br />    noise they made <br />    and<br />        the way no arrows, spears, etc appeared to<br />  come<br />    from the weapon <br />    when<br />        fired.<br />        These guns allowed small armies to make large<br />    gains on enemy<br />        territory. Small parties of skirmishers who<br />  had<br />    been dispatched<br />        simply to test enemy positions and tactics<br />  were<br />    making inroads <br />    into<br />        India.<br />        in panipat ibrahim Lodhi advanced against him<br />    with 100,000 <br />    soldiers<br />        and 100 elephants; and though Babur's army<br />  was<br />    possibly as few as<br />        25,000 men he won</p>
<p>        the cholas had perhaps never seen the cannon.<br />        even malik kafur who put an end to<br />  established<br />    muvendars in <br />    south had<br />        not seen one.</p>
<p>        earlier turks in the south used a flame<br />  thrower<br />    possibly using <br />    naptha.</p>
<p>        malik kafur used fire tipped arrows - the<br />  tips<br />    being made of <br />    camel<br />        dung and camel hair so that the fire doesnt<br />  get<br />    extinguished in <br />    the<br />        arrows flight</p>

<p>          Was reading a book and it was mentioned<br />  that<br />    the use of <br />    gunpowder<br />          spread to Europe in the 12th-13th centuries<br />    (possibly after <br />    Marco<br />          Polo?). Anyway, since India or at least the<br />    South had much more<br />          extensive contacts with the Chinese, how<br />    early did the South <br />    Indians<br />          (Chozhas, Pandyas etc) start using<br />  gunpowder?<br />    What is the <br />    earliest<br />          recorded work talking about the use of<br />    gunpowder?

          Use of gunpowder in South India..        </div>

<p>  Great work. Where did you get this info from?</p>
<p>  That's precisely what I mean. Since during the Chola<br />  times, there seems to<br />  have been the knowhow... and since Kullothunga etc<br />  went to China, I am<br />  surprised to see that this didn't make its<br />  appearance in South India before<br />  the Muslims arrived. Also, what is the earliest<br />  Tamil work that mentions the<br />  use of gunpowder in war?</p>

<p>    Hi Arun</p>
<p>    collected some info</p>
<p>    An early record of gunpowder, is in a Chinese book<br />  from c. 850 A.D.<br />    called "Classified Essentials of the Mysterious<br />  Tao of the True<br />    Origin of Things," indicates that gunpowder was a<br />  byproduct of Taoist<br />    alchemical efforts to develop an elixir of<br />  immortality.</p>
<p>    funny no?</p>
<p>    immortality and death.</p>
<p>    The Chinese first seem to have used gunpowder in<br />  warfare in 904 A.D.,<br />    as incendiary projectiles called "flying fires."<br />  (These were invented<br />    during the Tang Dynasty and were originally used<br />  for fireworks.)</p>
<p>    The important step was to use gunpowder as a<br />  propellant. The first<br />    such use was recorded in 1132 in experiments with<br />  mortars consisting<br />    of bamboo tubes. Mortars with metal tubes (made of<br />  iron or bronze)<br />    first appeared in the wars (1268-1279) between the<br />  Mongols and the<br />    Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>    so some parallel usage during chola times also.</p>

          Use of gunpowder in South India..        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Arun</p>
<p>my info is very elementary. but I think it warrants a better study <br />which we shall do in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>but this greek fire the predecessor of gunpowder( where one sprays <br />naptha and ignites it on ships) was a real fearsome ammunition <br />considering hulls of wood and sails of cloth.</p>
<p>I think the real work on gun based warfare started in the new roman <br />empire in constyatinople.</p>
<p>when mongols invaded delhi wassaf and khusro dont even mention sucha <br />weapon. they take pains to even describe the arrow proof siilk <br />underwear the mongols wore. they woulndt have missed this.</p>
<p>after the mongols came only malik visited south india. he didnt use <br />the weapon either.<br />so the first prize goes to babar. lodi was surprised at the weapon <br />and his elephants bolted at the thunder.</p>
<p>just wondering. if I as an individual had just one machine gun and <br />unlimited ammunition I could have conquered the chola chera and <br />pandyas.</p>
<p>thats the power of technology.</p>

          Use of gunpowder in South India..        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Venketesh,</p>
<p>Great work. Where did you get this info from?</p>
<p>That's precisely what I mean. Since during the Chola times, there seems to<br />have been the knowhow... and since Kullothunga etc went to China, I am<br />surprised to see that this didn't make its appearance in South India before<br />the Muslims arrived. Also, what is the earliest Tamil work that mentions the<br />use of gunpowder in war?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

          Use of gunpowder in South India..        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Arun</p>
<p>collected some info</p>
<p>An early record of gunpowder, is in a Chinese book from c. 850 A.D. <br />called "Classified Essentials of the Mysterious Tao of the True <br />Origin of Things," indicates that gunpowder was a byproduct of Taoist <br />alchemical efforts to develop an elixir of immortality.</p>
<p>funny no?</p>
<p>immortality and death.</p>
<p>The Chinese first seem to have used gunpowder in warfare in 904 A.D., <br />as incendiary projectiles called "flying fires." (These were invented <br />during the Tang Dynasty and were originally used for fireworks.)</p>
<p>The important step was to use gunpowder as a propellant. The first <br />such use was recorded in 1132 in experiments with mortars consisting <br />of bamboo tubes. Mortars with metal tubes (made of iron or bronze) <br />first appeared in the wars (1268-1279) between the Mongols and the <br />Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>so some parallel usage during chola times also.</p>

<p>    earlier turks in the south used a flame thrower possibly using <br />naptha.</p>
<p>    malik kafur used fire tipped arrows - the tips being made of <br />camel<br />    dung and camel hair so that the fire doesnt get extinguished in <br />the<br />    arrows flight</p>

        <p>Hi Arun<br />the chinese used to fill gun powder in a bamboo piece.</p>
<p>if they plugged it on both sides before igniting it was a bomb. if <br />they plugged only one side it became a rocket. they used rockets for <br />signalling extensively.</p>
<p>I dont think the chinese used gun powder during the times of the <br />cholas</p>
