</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>cholas and myanmar</p>
<p>Period of Rajaraja Chola - 1 {A.D.985 - 1014} </p>
<p>With the beginning of the tenth century the Cholas with their <br />capital in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, emerged as a powerful ruling <br />dynasty after a long spell in partial obscurity in the political <br />scene of South India. </p>
<p>In the year A.D.985 king Rajaraja Chola -1 ascended the throne as <br />the next successor to the Chola kingdom in Tamil Nadu. He gradually <br />conquered the neighbouring and far lying territories within the <br />Indian continent, forming a great Chola empire. </p>
<p>He laid a firm foundation to this empire by the wits of his <br />political ingenuity and well streamlined administrative system <br />backed by a powerful army and naval power which made it to grow <br />steadily into an overseas empire. </p>
<p>During this period in Miyanmar (the former Burma) there existed two <br />main kingdoms, namely the Arimaddanapura kingdom of the region <br />called Marammadesa (the present central Miyanmar) having the capital <br />at Arimaddanapura (the present Pagan), and the Talaing (Mon) kingdom <br />of the region called Rammanadesa (the present southern Miyanmar also <br />known as Arumanam in Tamil) having its capital at Sudhammavati (the <br />present Thaton). The capital city of Arimaddanapura of the medieval <br />period was also known as Pugarama and Pukkan. </p>
<p>While emperor Rajaraja Chola -1 was on the Chola throne, king <br />Kyaungbyu (A.D.984 -1006) was on the throne of Arimaddanapura <br />kingdom of Marammadesa, and was followed by his son king Kyizo <br />{A.D.1006-1012} on throne. But we are aware of the king who was <br />ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa during the period of <br />Rajaraja - 1. </p>
<p>During this period the traders from these two kingdoms traded with <br />Tamil Nadu in their commodities, and the teak wood from Rammanadesa <br />being one of their trading items, was known as "Arumanavan" in the <br />Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012-1044} </p>
<p>With the succession of emperor Rajendra Chola - 1 on Chola throne <br />after Rajaraja Chola - 1, king Sokkate (A.D.1012-1037) started rule <br />in the Arimaddanapura kingdom after his elder brother king Kyizo, <br />and in this same period we also note a king named Manuha (A.D.?? ? <br />1057) ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>During this time there had been much sea traffic between these two <br />countries. The traders from Tamil Nadu engaged themselves in trade <br />with the Miyanmar kingdoms of Rammanadesa (also known as Arumanam) <br />and the Mirammadesa. </p>
<p>In the meantime the Sri Vijaya kingdom of Sumatra was spreading it's <br />authority over whole of Sumatra and Java - of the present Indonesia <br />and over whole of Malaysia, forming an empire which was at one time <br />a great hinderance to the flourishing trade of the Cholas in South-<br />East Asia. It also seems that there had been similer hinderences to <br />the traders from Tamil Nadu in Rammanadesa in present Miyanmar. </p>
<p>Rajendra Chola ? 1 sent one of his grandson with great force in <br />A.D.1024 in many ships under a Chola prince who later bore the title <br />as "Kadaremkonda Cholan", which on their way to South-East Asia <br />after capturing the Manakkavaram (Great Nicobar Island), reached the <br />country of Rammanadesa in southern Miyanmar. </p>
<p>They devastated the seaport city of Mapappalam (most possibly the <br />present Dagon or Rangoon), and the interior capital city of <br />Sudammavathi (Thaton) with "protected fortress walls" - of the <br />Talaing (Mon) kingdom of Rammanadesa (Arumanam), and defeated it's <br />ruling king Manuha. It seems king Manuha submitted to the Rajendra <br />Chola's forces in this war and agreed to pay tributes. </p>
<p>At the Arimaddanapur kingdom king Sokkate was followed by his <br />younger brother Anuruddha also known as Anawratha (A.D.1037-1079) on <br />the throne. </p>
<p>Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} </p>
<p>In the year A.D.1044 Rajendra Chola -1 died and followed by his <br />eldest son emperor Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} on Chola <br />throne. It appears the king Manuha continued to pay tributes to the <br />Cholas and the trade between two countries continued. </p>
<p>Period of Rajendra Chola -2 {A.D.1051-1063} </p>
<p>Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 was followed by his younger brother emperor <br />Rajendra Chola ? 2 on Chola throne. </p>
<p>Some years later a Buddhist dignitary named Shin Arahan who came to <br />the Arimaddana kingdom from the Talaing kingdom in south Miyanmar <br />and converted king Anuruddha to Theravada Buddhism. Shin Arahan also <br />informed him that in the capital city Sudammavati of the Talaing <br />kingdom, there were thirty sets of three Buddhist Pitakas and also <br />many sacred relics. </p>
<p>King Anuruddha deeply engrossed in Theravada Buddhism sent his wise <br />minister with much gifts and presents to king Manuha requesting some <br />copies of Pitaka and relics which was refused by him with much ill <br />reply. </p>
<p>This ended up with enraged king Anuruddha waging war with king <br />Manuha of the Talaing kingdom in the year A.D.1057, in which king <br />Manuha was defeated and taken captive with his entire family to <br />Arimaddanapura. </p>
<p>empire under the rule of king Anuruddha, and a viceroy was appointed <br />to overlook the affairs of this region. King Anuruddha chose <br />Tharehkiltara (present Prome) in the Pegu region as his new capital <br />of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it's <br />importance with it's destruction by his forces and with the capture <br />of it's king Manuha. </p>
<p>It appears emperor Anuruddha with the fall of Rammanadesa, and it <br />coming under his empire possibly appointed one of his own viceroy to <br />rule over same, and also refused to pay tributes to the Cholas. </p>
<p>There seems to have been no immediate response and retaliation from <br />the Cholas on the fall of Rammanadesa to Anuruddha's forces, and <br />which was now in the hands of the Arimaddanapur empire. </p>
<p>Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1062-1070} </p>
<p>Rajendra Chola ? 2 was followed by his younger brother emperor <br />Virarajendra Chola on Chola throne. It appear during this time the <br />viceroy of Anuruddha interfered with the privilages enjoyed by the <br />Chola traders already trading in Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>In this same period the king of Kadarem (present Kedah region of <br />Malaysia) with the re-capture of this kingdom by the ruling king of <br />Sri Vijaya of that period, sought the assistance of Virarajendra <br />Chola in regaining his kingdom. </p>
<p>The emperor Virarajendra Chola sent an expedition in the year <br />A.D.1068 under his nephew (sister's son) Kulothunga to help the king <br />of Kadarem in winning back his kingdom. Kulothunga Chola lead his <br />great forces in person, and reached Rammanadesa on his way to <br />Kadarem and defeated the viceroy of Anuruddha ruling from <br />Tharehkiltara (Prome) and captured the Rammanadesa (Arumanam). </p>
<p>However Kulothunga Chola re-instated the viceroy of Anuruddha at <br />Rammanadesa on king Anuruddha agreeing to pay tributes to Cholas and <br />allowing the Chola traders to trade freely in this region. It <br />appears Kulothunga Chola thereafter stationed a fleet of Chola <br />forces at Thandaung east of Prome to look after the interests of the <br />Chola traders concentrated in this region. As a mark of his victory <br />over Rammanadesa Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />victory "jayastamba" at Prome. </p>
<p>Period of Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} </p>
<p>In the year A.D.1070 emperor Virarajendra Chola died, and his son <br />Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} succeeded on he Chola throne. </p>
<p>During this period the king Vijayabahu - 1 (A.D.1059-1114) of Sri <br />Lanka was struggling hard to relieve the northen half of his country <br />from the Chola domination. After many unsuccesfull efforts, few <br />years before the year A.D.1071 he sent some envoys with rich <br />presents to emperor Anuruddha of Arimaddanapur in Miyanmar, <br />requesting for military assistance against Cholas. </p>
<p>But Anuruddha probably realising the impending danger to his growing <br />empire, in the event he antagonised the mighty Cholas by providing <br />forces to Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka, instead sent rich presents to him <br />including camphor and sandlewood in place of soldiers. </p>
<p>Period of Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} </p>
<p>Athirajendra Chola too died shortly thereafter in illness, which <br />resulted in emperor Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} ascending <br />the Chola throne as the next successor in the year A.D.1073. </p>
<p>In Sri Lanka Vijayabahu - 1 withstanding the decision made by <br />Anuruddha, on his own waged war with the Cholas and successfully <br />expelled them from Sri Lanka in the year A.D.1074, after a period of <br />nearly 72 years of their direct rule over the northern half of Sri <br />Lanka. With this victory king Vijayabahu assumed the <br />title "Chaththuru Chola kula anthaha". The new Chola emperor the <br />Kulothunga Chola - 1 made no attempts in recovering the lost <br />northern half of Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>King Vijayabahu immediately after his victory over Cholas in <br />A.D.1074 sent his envoys to Rammanadesa - which was now in the <br />control of the Arimaddana king - requesting for twenty pious elderly <br />Buddhist monks versent in Pitaka, along with the religious books, <br />and some sacred relics. King Anuruddha responded to this request and <br />sent learned Buddhist monks with copies of Pitaka who instituted a <br />Nikaya (Sect) known as Rammana Nikaya to re-foster Buddhism in Sri <br />Lanka. </p>
<p>Emperor Anuruddha was followed by his son Sawulu on throne <br />Arimaddanapur {A.D.1079-1084}. Towards the latter part of his rule <br />the general Kyanzittha decided to get rid of the Chola forces <br />stationed in Thandung and sent his forces to defeat them. However <br />immediately after this incidence emperor Sawulu died and Kyanzittha <br />also known as Tribuwanaditya) (A.D.1084-1112), who was also a son of <br />Anurudda by his another queen - an Indian princess from Bengal - <br />took over the throne at Arimaddanapur. </p>
<p>At this time of his coronation the Kyanzitha's forces returned back <br />saying they have conquered the Indian country of Thandaung and Nga <br />Thon Pinle (thickly populated Miyanmar regions with Chola - Traders <br />and forces) in the present Pegu division, and captured the Tamil <br />Chola (Tamil Indian) warriors stationed in this region, who were now <br />settled in another region named Singu east of Arimaddanapur possibly <br />under captivity. </p>
<p>Some years after A.D.1084 it appears Kulothunga Chola sent an army <br />under a Chola prince to one of the ports of Rammanadesa to avenge <br />the capture of Chola forces, and king Kyanzitha now without <br />antogonising the Chola prince sent tributes and warmely welcomed <br />him, possibly released the Chola warriors under captivity, and took <br />time to appraise him on the great religion of Buddhism who <br />apparently adhered to the Buddhist religion. </p>
<p>The Chola Prince in strengthening his friendship with the <br />Arimaddanapura kingdom also gave his daughter in marriage to <br />Kyanzittha, thus smoothening the relations of the Cholas with the <br />Arimaddanpur kingdom of Miyanmar. The name of this Chola prince and <br />his daughter given in marriage to Kyanzittha is not known. </p>
<p>It appears during this period with the newly builtup relations the <br />traders from the Tamil Nadu and the other countries of the Chola <br />empire, became very free to trade as far as Arimaddanapur the <br />capital city of Kyanzitha in central Miyanmar region, and they were <br />also able to build a Vishnu temple at Arimaddanapur without any <br />hinderance in the very heart of a Buddhist country named <br />as "Nanadesi Vinnagar Alvar Koyil". </p>
<p>Some years later a trader named "Irayiran Sriyananana Kulasekara <br />Nambiyar" from Mahodayapuram (present Cranganore) of the <br />Malaimandalam (the present Kerala state) of South India - the former <br />capital city of the Chera kingdom which was at that time under the <br />rule of the Chola empire - built a sacred mandapa (hall), gave a <br />sacred door to same, and one standing lamp to burn constantly in the <br />mandapa of this temple. </p>
<p>In the year A.D.1106 Kyanzittha sent envoys to to pay tributes to <br />the Chinese emperor Hui Tsung (A.D.1101-1126) of the Sung Empire. <br />The emperor orderd the envoys to be provided the same rank and <br />ceremony as to the envoys from the Chola country. But the grand <br />council advised "....the Chola country is subject to Sri Vijaya. <br />During the hsi-ning period (A.D.1068-79) imperial decrees were <br />addressed to it on thick-backed paper and enclosed in box and <br />wrapper. Now Pukan Arimaddanapur) is a big kingdom. We cannot look <br />down on it as an ordinary little dependent kingdom. We desire to <br />adopt the same protocal as in the case of the Ta-shih (Arabs), Chiao-<br />chih (Annam) etc to whom imperial appointments and decrees were all <br />written on white-backed, gold flowered, damask paper, and stored in <br />a partly gold gilt tube with key and forwarded in a brocade silk <br />double wrapper as sealing envelope ? The emperor approved....." </p>
<p>Emperor Kyanzittha was followed by his grandson Alaungsithu <br />(A.D.1112-1187) on the Arimaddanapur throne. </p>
<p>Period Vikkrama Chola {A.D.1118 -1135} &amp; Kulothunga Chola -2 <br />{A.D.1133-1150} </p>
<p>It appears the good relations the Arimaddanapur kingdom had with <br />Cholas continued for some time even after Kulothunga Chola ? 1, <br />during the period of rule of Vikkrama Chola and Kulothunga Chola ? <br />2. </p>
<p>Period of Rajaraja Chola ? 2 {A.D.1146-1163} </p>
<p>However during the rule of Rajaraja-2 we note, among the distant <br />lands which sent tributes to the Chola country is the Pappalam the <br />seaport city of Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>However the fact remains that there had been continuos sea traffic <br />on account of trade between TamilNadu and the Miyanmar kingdoms even <br />thereafter, and we note in the year A.D.1178 Chinese traders being <br />aware that one who wishes to go to the Chola kingdom from China, has <br />to either tranship from Kollam kingdom or go there from the Pukan <br />(Arimaddanapur) kingdom. This clearly indicates the extent of trade <br />activities between China, Pukan and Chola country. </p>
<p>Period of Pandiyas after Medieval Cholas </p>
<p>Even after the fall of Chola empire and the re-surgence of the <br />Pandiyan empire, we note Pandiyan kings having relations with <br />Arumanam the Rammanadesa of the Miyanmar country. </p>
<p>Maravarman Sundarapandiyan ? 2 {A.D.1238-1251} claims to be the <br />overlord of the king of Poppalam (Pappalam), and Sadaiyavarman <br />Sunderapandiyan {A.D.1251-1271} claims having received tributes from <br />Arumanam. However the Pandiya relations with Miyanmar country is <br />left out for further research study as it does not fall within the <br />scope of the title of this essay. </p>

<p>  not actually. i was in the andamans very recently and learnt that <br />  burma was so close. it was just an inkling .<br />  but on second thought i feel the invasion must have been using <br />naval <br />  power travelling along the coramandel coast, not far from the <br />  shoreline.<br />  this was precisely the route taken by 19th century tamil traders.<br />  ships from burma used to come back and behind them were tied logs <br />of <br />  burma tea. the wood got a special seasoning in the seawater and <br />were <br />  pliable for excellent finishing. entire chettinad teak pillars, <br />roofs <br />  and furniture travelled this soaking route.<br />  they still survive today.</p>

<p>However I can check and tell you !</p>
<p>But the Rajendra to Kulothunga period expeditions are atleast not <br />widely discussed ..</p>
<p>Moreover as you have been posting details, we should look at them <br />from the Overseas History Records.. !</p>

<p>  PILLARS OF VICTORY AT PEGU.</p>
<p>  On the Pegu-Thanatpin road two octagonal granite pillars, <br />  measuring about 11 and 5 feet, respectively, were found and one of <br />  them has been re-erected on a masonry plinth in the compound of <br />the <br />  district court at Pegu. They may be identified with the <br />Jayastambha <br />  or Pillars of Victory set up by Rajendra Chola I., who overran <br />Pegu <br />  in 1025-1027 A. D., that is to say, a few years before the <br />conquest <br />  of Thaton by Anawrata, King of Pagan</p>
<p>  ***************************************************************</p>
<p>  reproducing from an earlier post ( the entire post of <br />viraranjendra) <br />  down below ( full post further down)</p>
<p>  King Anuruddha chose <br />    Tharehkiltara (present Prome) in the Pegu region as his new <br />  capital <br />    of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it's <br />    importance with it's destruction by his forces and with the <br />  capture <br />    of it's king Manuha. </p>
<p>  ***************************************************************</p>
<p>  the above means pegu was capital much after RJC period. so the <br />  victory pillars cannot be assigned to rjc.</p>
<p>  from the post below ( dont know the source of the info though)</p>
<p>  Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />    victory "jayastamba" at Prome. this is from the second attack.</p>

<p>    cholas and myanmar</p>
<p>    Period of Rajaraja Chola - 1 {A.D.985 - 1014} </p>
<p>    With the beginning of the tenth century the Cholas with their <br />    capital in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, emerged as a powerful ruling <br />    dynasty after a long spell in partial obscurity in the political <br />    scene of South India. </p>
<p>    In the year A.D.985 king Rajaraja Chola -1 ascended the throne <br />as <br />    the next successor to the Chola kingdom in Tamil Nadu. He <br />  gradually <br />    conquered the neighbouring and far lying territories within the <br />    Indian continent, forming a great Chola empire. </p>
<p>    He laid a firm foundation to this empire by the wits of his <br />    political ingenuity and well streamlined administrative system <br />    backed by a powerful army and naval power which made it to grow <br />    steadily into an overseas empire. </p>
<p>    During this period in Miyanmar (the former Burma) there existed <br />  two <br />    main kingdoms, namely the Arimaddanapura kingdom of the region <br />    called Marammadesa (the present central Miyanmar) having the <br />  capital <br />    at Arimaddanapura (the present Pagan), and the Talaing (Mon) <br />  kingdom <br />    of the region called Rammanadesa (the present southern Miyanmar <br />  also <br />    known as Arumanam in Tamil) having its capital at Sudhammavati <br />  (the <br />    present Thaton). The capital city of Arimaddanapura of the <br />  medieval <br />    period was also known as Pugarama and Pukkan. </p>
<p>    While emperor Rajaraja Chola -1 was on the Chola throne, king <br />    Kyaungbyu (A.D.984 -1006) was on the throne of Arimaddanapura <br />    kingdom of Marammadesa, and was followed by his son king Kyizo <br />    {A.D.1006-1012} on throne. But we are aware of the king who was <br />    ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa during the period of <br />    Rajaraja - 1. </p>
<p>    During this period the traders from these two kingdoms traded <br />with <br />    Tamil Nadu in their commodities, and the teak wood from <br />  Rammanadesa <br />    being one of their trading items, was known as "Arumanavan" in <br />the <br />    Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>    Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012-1044} </p>
<p>    With the succession of emperor Rajendra Chola - 1 on Chola <br />throne <br />    after Rajaraja Chola - 1, king Sokkate (A.D.1012-1037) started <br />  rule <br />    in the Arimaddanapura kingdom after his elder brother king <br />Kyizo, <br />    and in this same period we also note a king named Manuha <br />(A.D.?? ? <br />    1057) ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>    During this time there had been much sea traffic between these <br />two <br />    countries. The traders from Tamil Nadu engaged themselves in <br />trade <br />    with the Miyanmar kingdoms of Rammanadesa (also known as <br />Arumanam) <br />    and the Mirammadesa. </p>
<p>    In the meantime the Sri Vijaya kingdom of Sumatra was spreading <br />  it's <br />    authority over whole of Sumatra and Java - of the present <br />  Indonesia <br />    and over whole of Malaysia, forming an empire which was at one <br />  time <br />    a great hinderance to the flourishing trade of the Cholas in <br />South-<br />    East Asia. It also seems that there had been similer hinderences <br />  to <br />    the traders from Tamil Nadu in Rammanadesa in present Miyanmar. </p>
<p>    Rajendra Chola ? 1 sent one of his grandson with great force in <br />    A.D.1024 in many ships under a Chola prince who later bore the <br />  title <br />    as "Kadaremkonda Cholan", which on their way to South-East Asia <br />    after capturing the Manakkavaram (Great Nicobar Island), reached <br />  the <br />    country of Rammanadesa in southern Miyanmar. </p>
<p>    They devastated the seaport city of Mapappalam (most possibly <br />the <br />    present Dagon or Rangoon), and the interior capital city of <br />    Sudammavathi (Thaton) with "protected fortress walls" - of the <br />    Talaing (Mon) kingdom of Rammanadesa (Arumanam), and defeated <br />it's <br />    ruling king Manuha. It seems king Manuha submitted to the <br />Rajendra <br />    Chola's forces in this war and agreed to pay tributes. </p>
<p>    At the Arimaddanapur kingdom king Sokkate was followed by his <br />    younger brother Anuruddha also known as Anawratha (A.D.1037-<br />1079) <br />  on <br />    the throne. </p>
<p>    Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} </p>
<p>    In the year A.D.1044 Rajendra Chola -1 died and followed by his <br />    eldest son emperor Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} on <br />Chola <br />    throne. It appears the king Manuha continued to pay tributes to <br />  the <br />    Cholas and the trade between two countries continued. </p>
<p>    Period of Rajendra Chola -2 {A.D.1051-1063} </p>
<p>    Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 was followed by his younger brother <br />emperor <br />    Rajendra Chola ? 2 on Chola throne. </p>
<p>    Some years later a Buddhist dignitary named Shin Arahan who came <br />  to <br />    the Arimaddana kingdom from the Talaing kingdom in south <br />Miyanmar <br />    and converted king Anuruddha to Theravada Buddhism. Shin Arahan <br />  also <br />    informed him that in the capital city Sudammavati of the Talaing <br />    kingdom, there were thirty sets of three Buddhist Pitakas and <br />also <br />    many sacred relics. </p>
<p>    King Anuruddha deeply engrossed in Theravada Buddhism sent his <br />  wise <br />    minister with much gifts and presents to king Manuha requesting <br />  some <br />    copies of Pitaka and relics which was refused by him with much <br />ill <br />    reply. </p>
<p>    This ended up with enraged king Anuruddha waging war with king <br />    Manuha of the Talaing kingdom in the year A.D.1057, in which <br />king <br />    Manuha was defeated and taken captive with his entire family to <br />    Arimaddanapura. </p>
<p>  Arimaddana <br />    empire under the rule of king Anuruddha, and a viceroy was <br />  appointed <br />    to overlook the affairs of this region. King Anuruddha chose <br />    Tharehkiltara (present Prome) in the Pegu region as his new <br />  capital <br />    of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it's <br />    importance with it's destruction by his forces and with the <br />  capture <br />    of it's king Manuha. </p>
<p>    It appears emperor Anuruddha with the fall of Rammanadesa, and <br />it <br />    coming under his empire possibly appointed one of his own <br />viceroy <br />  to <br />    rule over same, and also refused to pay tributes to the Cholas. </p>
<p>    There seems to have been no immediate response and retaliation <br />  from <br />    the Cholas on the fall of Rammanadesa to Anuruddha's forces, and <br />    which was now in the hands of the Arimaddanapur empire. </p>
<p>    Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1062-1070} </p>
<p>    Rajendra Chola ? 2 was followed by his younger brother emperor <br />    Virarajendra Chola on Chola throne. It appear during this time <br />the <br />    viceroy of Anuruddha interfered with the privilages enjoyed by <br />the <br />    Chola traders already trading in Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>    In this same period the king of Kadarem (present Kedah region of <br />    Malaysia) with the re-capture of this kingdom by the ruling king <br />  of <br />    Sri Vijaya of that period, sought the assistance of Virarajendra <br />    Chola in regaining his kingdom. </p>
<p>    The emperor Virarajendra Chola sent an expedition in the year <br />    A.D.1068 under his nephew (sister's son) Kulothunga to help the <br />  king <br />    of Kadarem in winning back his kingdom. Kulothunga Chola lead <br />his <br />    great forces in person, and reached Rammanadesa on his way to <br />    Kadarem and defeated the viceroy of Anuruddha ruling from <br />    Tharehkiltara (Prome) and captured the Rammanadesa (Arumanam). </p>
<p>    However Kulothunga Chola re-instated the viceroy of Anuruddha at <br />    Rammanadesa on king Anuruddha agreeing to pay tributes to Cholas <br />  and <br />    allowing the Chola traders to trade freely in this region. It <br />    appears Kulothunga Chola thereafter stationed a fleet of Chola <br />    forces at Thandaung east of Prome to look after the interests of <br />  the <br />    Chola traders concentrated in this region. As a mark of his <br />  victory <br />    over Rammanadesa Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />    victory "jayastamba" at Prome. </p>
<p>    Period of Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} </p>
<p>    In the year A.D.1070 emperor Virarajendra Chola died, and his <br />son <br />    Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} succeeded on he Chola throne. </p>
<p>    During this period the king Vijayabahu - 1 (A.D.1059-1114) of <br />Sri <br />    Lanka was struggling hard to relieve the northen half of his <br />  country <br />    from the Chola domination. After many unsuccesfull efforts, few <br />    years before the year A.D.1071 he sent some envoys with rich <br />    presents to emperor Anuruddha of Arimaddanapur in Miyanmar, <br />    requesting for military assistance against Cholas. </p>
<p>    But Anuruddha probably realising the impending danger to his <br />  growing <br />    empire, in the event he antagonised the mighty Cholas by <br />providing <br />    forces to Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka, instead sent rich presents to <br />  him <br />    including camphor and sandlewood in place of soldiers. </p>
<p>    Period of Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} </p>
<p>    Athirajendra Chola too died shortly thereafter in illness, which <br />    resulted in emperor Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} <br />ascending <br />    the Chola throne as the next successor in the year A.D.1073. </p>
<p>    In Sri Lanka Vijayabahu - 1 withstanding the decision made by <br />    Anuruddha, on his own waged war with the Cholas and successfully <br />    expelled them from Sri Lanka in the year A.D.1074, after a <br />period <br />  of <br />    nearly 72 years of their direct rule over the northern half of <br />Sri <br />    Lanka. With this victory king Vijayabahu assumed the <br />    title "Chaththuru Chola kula anthaha". The new Chola emperor the <br />    Kulothunga Chola - 1 made no attempts in recovering the lost <br />    northern half of Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>    King Vijayabahu immediately after his victory over Cholas in <br />    A.D.1074 sent his envoys to Rammanadesa - which was now in the <br />    control of the Arimaddana king - requesting for twenty pious <br />  elderly <br />    Buddhist monks versent in Pitaka, along with the religious <br />books, <br />    and some sacred relics. King Anuruddha responded to this request <br />  and <br />    sent learned Buddhist monks with copies of Pitaka who instituted <br />a <br />    Nikaya (Sect) known as Rammana Nikaya to re-foster Buddhism in <br />Sri <br />    Lanka. </p>
<p>    Emperor Anuruddha was followed by his son Sawulu on throne <br />    Arimaddanapur {A.D.1079-1084}. Towards the latter part of his <br />rule <br />    the general Kyanzittha decided to get rid of the Chola forces <br />    stationed in Thandung and sent his forces to defeat them. <br />However <br />    immediately after this incidence emperor Sawulu died and <br />  Kyanzittha <br />    also known as Tribuwanaditya) (A.D.1084-1112), who was also a <br />son <br />  of <br />    Anurudda by his another queen - an Indian princess from Bengal - <br />    took over the throne at Arimaddanapur. </p>
<p>    At this time of his coronation the Kyanzitha's forces returned <br />  back <br />    saying they have conquered the Indian country of Thandaung and <br />Nga <br />    Thon Pinle (thickly populated Miyanmar regions with Chola - <br />  Traders <br />    and forces) in the present Pegu division, and captured the Tamil <br />    Chola (Tamil Indian) warriors stationed in this region, who were <br />  now <br />    settled in another region named Singu east of Arimaddanapur <br />  possibly <br />    under captivity. </p>
<p>    Some years after A.D.1084 it appears Kulothunga Chola sent an <br />army <br />    under a Chola prince to one of the ports of Rammanadesa to <br />avenge <br />    the capture of Chola forces, and king Kyanzitha now without <br />    antogonising the Chola prince sent tributes and warmely welcomed <br />    him, possibly released the Chola warriors under captivity, and <br />  took <br />    time to appraise him on the great religion of Buddhism who <br />    apparently adhered to the Buddhist religion. </p>
<p>    The Chola Prince in strengthening his friendship with the <br />    Arimaddanapura kingdom also gave his daughter in marriage to <br />    Kyanzittha, thus smoothening the relations of the Cholas with <br />the <br />    Arimaddanpur kingdom of Miyanmar. The name of this Chola prince <br />  and <br />    his daughter given in marriage to Kyanzittha is not known. </p>
<p>    It appears during this period with the newly builtup relations <br />the <br />    traders from the Tamil Nadu and the other countries of the Chola <br />    empire, became very free to trade as far as Arimaddanapur the <br />    capital city of Kyanzitha in central Miyanmar region, and they <br />  were <br />    also able to build a Vishnu temple at Arimaddanapur without any <br />    hinderance in the very heart of a Buddhist country named <br />    as "Nanadesi Vinnagar Alvar Koyil". </p>
<p>    Some years later a trader named "Irayiran Sriyananana Kulasekara <br />    Nambiyar" from Mahodayapuram (present Cranganore) of the <br />    Malaimandalam (the present Kerala state) of South India - the <br />  former <br />    capital city of the Chera kingdom which was at that time under <br />the <br />    rule of the Chola empire - built a sacred mandapa (hall), gave a <br />    sacred door to same, and one standing lamp to burn constantly in <br />  the <br />    mandapa of this temple. </p>
<p>    In the year A.D.1106 Kyanzittha sent envoys to to pay tributes <br />to <br />    the Chinese emperor Hui Tsung (A.D.1101-1126) of the Sung <br />Empire. <br />    The emperor orderd the envoys to be provided the same rank and <br />    ceremony as to the envoys from the Chola country. But the grand <br />    council advised "....the Chola country is subject to Sri Vijaya. <br />    During the hsi-ning period (A.D.1068-79) imperial decrees were <br />    addressed to it on thick-backed paper and enclosed in box and <br />    wrapper. Now Pukan Arimaddanapur) is a big kingdom. We cannot <br />look <br />    down on it as an ordinary little dependent kingdom. We desire to <br />    adopt the same protocal as in the case of the Ta-shih (Arabs), <br />  Chiao-<br />    chih (Annam) etc to whom imperial appointments and decrees were <br />  all <br />    written on white-backed, gold flowered, damask paper, and stored <br />  in <br />    a partly gold gilt tube with key and forwarded in a brocade silk <br />    double wrapper as sealing envelope ? The emperor approved....." </p>
<p>    Emperor Kyanzittha was followed by his grandson Alaungsithu <br />    (A.D.1112-1187) on the Arimaddanapur throne. </p>
<p>    Period Vikkrama Chola {A.D.1118 -1135} &amp; Kulothunga Chola -2 <br />    {A.D.1133-1150} </p>
<p>    It appears the good relations the Arimaddanapur kingdom had with <br />    Cholas continued for some time even after Kulothunga Chola ? 1, <br />    during the period of rule of Vikkrama Chola and Kulothunga <br />Chola ? <br />    2. </p>
<p>    Period of Rajaraja Chola ? 2 {A.D.1146-1163} </p>
<p>    However during the rule of Rajaraja-2 we note, among the distant <br />    lands which sent tributes to the Chola country is the Pappalam <br />the <br />    seaport city of Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>    However the fact remains that there had been continuos sea <br />traffic <br />    on account of trade between TamilNadu and the Miyanmar kingdoms <br />  even <br />    thereafter, and we note in the year A.D.1178 Chinese traders <br />being <br />    aware that one who wishes to go to the Chola kingdom from China, <br />  has <br />    to either tranship from Kollam kingdom or go there from the <br />Pukan <br />    (Arimaddanapur) kingdom. This clearly indicates the extent of <br />  trade <br />    activities between China, Pukan and Chola country. </p>
<p>    Period of Pandiyas after Medieval Cholas </p>
<p>    Even after the fall of Chola empire and the re-surgence of the <br />    Pandiyan empire, we note Pandiyan kings having relations with <br />    Arumanam the Rammanadesa of the Miyanmar country. </p>
<p>    Maravarman Sundarapandiyan ? 2 {A.D.1238-1251} claims to be the <br />    overlord of the king of Poppalam (Pappalam), and Sadaiyavarman <br />    Sunderapandiyan {A.D.1251-1271} claims having received tributes <br />  from <br />    Arumanam. However the Pandiya relations with Miyanmar country is <br />    left out for further research study as it does not fall within <br />the <br />    scope of the title of this essay.</p></vj_episteme@></p></blockquote>

<p>not actually. i was in the andamans very recently and learnt that <br />burma was so close. it was just an inkling .<br />but on second thought i feel the invasion must have been using naval <br />power travelling along the coramandel coast, not far from the <br />shoreline.<br />this was precisely the route taken by 19th century tamil traders.<br />ships from burma used to come back and behind them were tied logs of <br />burma tea. the wood got a special seasoning in the seawater and were <br />pliable for excellent finishing. entire chettinad teak pillars, roofs <br />and furniture travelled this soaking route.<br />they still survive today.</p>

<p>Thinking of all these battles, it is amazing to see their ability to<br />plan and execute these battles. They must be having good spies and<br />persons who knows those places very well to plan the attack that too<br />far away from the capital...</p>

        <p>hi sps sir,</p>
<p>Have a doubt - myanmmar was overrun by chola forces thrice..once <br />under Rjc 1 1024 and the second time by Virarajendra Chola -1068 ( <br />army led by his nephew (sister's son) Kulothunga ) and third time<br />in 1084 Kulothunga Chola ( this time apparently led by a chola <br />prince -who brokers peace and marries a chola princess to them!! <br />whose identities are not known - looks like a good plot for another <br />novel)</p>
<p>Doubt is from below article</p>
<p><a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/tawsein.htm" title="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/tawsein.htm">http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/tawsein.htm</a></p>
<p>PILLARS OF VICTORY AT PEGU.</p>
<p>On the Pegu-Thanatpin road two octagonal granite pillars, <br />measuring about 11 and 5 feet, respectively, were found and one of <br />them has been re-erected on a masonry plinth in the compound of the <br />district court at Pegu. They may be identified with the Jayastambha <br />or Pillars of Victory set up by Rajendra Chola I., who overran Pegu <br />in 1025-1027 A. D., that is to say, a few years before the conquest <br />of Thaton by Anawrata, King of Pagan</p>
<p>***************************************************************</p>
<p>reproducing from an earlier post ( the entire post of viraranjendra) <br />down below ( full post further down)</p>
<p>King Anuruddha chose </p>
<blockquote><p>  Tharehkiltara (present Prome) in the Pegu region as his new <br />capital <br />  of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it's <br />  importance with it's destruction by his forces and with the <br />capture <br />  of it's king Manuha. </p></blockquote>
<p>***************************************************************</p>
<p>the above means pegu was capital much after RJC period. so the <br />victory pillars cannot be assigned to rjc.</p>
<p>from the post below ( dont know the source of the info though)</p>
<p>Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of </p>
<blockquote><p>  victory "jayastamba" at Prome. this is from the second attack.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>  cholas and myanmar</p>
<p>  Period of Rajaraja Chola - 1 {A.D.985 - 1014} </p>
<p>  With the beginning of the tenth century the Cholas with their <br />  capital in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, emerged as a powerful ruling <br />  dynasty after a long spell in partial obscurity in the political <br />  scene of South India. </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.985 king Rajaraja Chola -1 ascended the throne as <br />  the next successor to the Chola kingdom in Tamil Nadu. He <br />gradually <br />  conquered the neighbouring and far lying territories within the <br />  Indian continent, forming a great Chola empire. </p>
<p>  He laid a firm foundation to this empire by the wits of his <br />  political ingenuity and well streamlined administrative system <br />  backed by a powerful army and naval power which made it to grow <br />  steadily into an overseas empire. </p>
<p>  During this period in Miyanmar (the former Burma) there existed <br />two <br />  main kingdoms, namely the Arimaddanapura kingdom of the region <br />  called Marammadesa (the present central Miyanmar) having the <br />capital <br />  at Arimaddanapura (the present Pagan), and the Talaing (Mon) <br />kingdom <br />  of the region called Rammanadesa (the present southern Miyanmar <br />also <br />  known as Arumanam in Tamil) having its capital at Sudhammavati <br />(the <br />  present Thaton). The capital city of Arimaddanapura of the <br />medieval <br />  period was also known as Pugarama and Pukkan. </p>
<p>  While emperor Rajaraja Chola -1 was on the Chola throne, king <br />  Kyaungbyu (A.D.984 -1006) was on the throne of Arimaddanapura <br />  kingdom of Marammadesa, and was followed by his son king Kyizo <br />  {A.D.1006-1012} on throne. But we are aware of the king who was <br />  ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa during the period of <br />  Rajaraja - 1. </p>
<p>  During this period the traders from these two kingdoms traded with <br />  Tamil Nadu in their commodities, and the teak wood from <br />Rammanadesa <br />  being one of their trading items, was known as "Arumanavan" in the <br />  Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>  Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012-1044} </p>
<p>  With the succession of emperor Rajendra Chola - 1 on Chola throne <br />  after Rajaraja Chola - 1, king Sokkate (A.D.1012-1037) started <br />rule <br />  in the Arimaddanapura kingdom after his elder brother king Kyizo, <br />  and in this same period we also note a king named Manuha (A.D.?? ? <br />  1057) ruling the Talaing kingdom of Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>  During this time there had been much sea traffic between these two <br />  countries. The traders from Tamil Nadu engaged themselves in trade <br />  with the Miyanmar kingdoms of Rammanadesa (also known as Arumanam) <br />  and the Mirammadesa. </p>
<p>  In the meantime the Sri Vijaya kingdom of Sumatra was spreading <br />it's <br />  authority over whole of Sumatra and Java - of the present <br />Indonesia <br />  and over whole of Malaysia, forming an empire which was at one <br />time <br />  a great hinderance to the flourishing trade of the Cholas in South-<br />  East Asia. It also seems that there had been similer hinderences <br />to <br />  the traders from Tamil Nadu in Rammanadesa in present Miyanmar. </p>
<p>  Rajendra Chola ? 1 sent one of his grandson with great force in <br />  A.D.1024 in many ships under a Chola prince who later bore the <br />title <br />  as "Kadaremkonda Cholan", which on their way to South-East Asia <br />  after capturing the Manakkavaram (Great Nicobar Island), reached <br />the <br />  country of Rammanadesa in southern Miyanmar. </p>
<p>  They devastated the seaport city of Mapappalam (most possibly the <br />  present Dagon or Rangoon), and the interior capital city of <br />  Sudammavathi (Thaton) with "protected fortress walls" - of the <br />  Talaing (Mon) kingdom of Rammanadesa (Arumanam), and defeated it's <br />  ruling king Manuha. It seems king Manuha submitted to the Rajendra <br />  Chola's forces in this war and agreed to pay tributes. </p>
<p>  At the Arimaddanapur kingdom king Sokkate was followed by his <br />  younger brother Anuruddha also known as Anawratha (A.D.1037-1079) <br />on <br />  the throne. </p>
<p>  Period of Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1044 Rajendra Chola -1 died and followed by his <br />  eldest son emperor Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} on Chola <br />  throne. It appears the king Manuha continued to pay tributes to <br />the <br />  Cholas and the trade between two countries continued. </p>
<p>  Period of Rajendra Chola -2 {A.D.1051-1063} </p>
<p>  Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 was followed by his younger brother emperor <br />  Rajendra Chola ? 2 on Chola throne. </p>
<p>  Some years later a Buddhist dignitary named Shin Arahan who came <br />to <br />  the Arimaddana kingdom from the Talaing kingdom in south Miyanmar <br />  and converted king Anuruddha to Theravada Buddhism. Shin Arahan <br />also <br />  informed him that in the capital city Sudammavati of the Talaing <br />  kingdom, there were thirty sets of three Buddhist Pitakas and also <br />  many sacred relics. </p>
<p>  King Anuruddha deeply engrossed in Theravada Buddhism sent his <br />wise <br />  minister with much gifts and presents to king Manuha requesting <br />some <br />  copies of Pitaka and relics which was refused by him with much ill <br />  reply. </p>
<p>  This ended up with enraged king Anuruddha waging war with king <br />  Manuha of the Talaing kingdom in the year A.D.1057, in which king <br />  Manuha was defeated and taken captive with his entire family to <br />  Arimaddanapura. </p>
<p>Arimaddana <br />  empire under the rule of king Anuruddha, and a viceroy was <br />appointed <br />  to overlook the affairs of this region. King Anuruddha chose <br />  Tharehkiltara (present Prome) in the Pegu region as his new <br />capital <br />  of Rammanadesa in place of Thaton, which has now lost it's <br />  importance with it's destruction by his forces and with the <br />capture <br />  of it's king Manuha. </p>
<p>  It appears emperor Anuruddha with the fall of Rammanadesa, and it <br />  coming under his empire possibly appointed one of his own viceroy <br />to <br />  rule over same, and also refused to pay tributes to the Cholas. </p>
<p>  There seems to have been no immediate response and retaliation <br />from <br />  the Cholas on the fall of Rammanadesa to Anuruddha's forces, and <br />  which was now in the hands of the Arimaddanapur empire. </p>
<p>  Period of Virarajendra Chola {A.D.1062-1070} </p>
<p>  Rajendra Chola ? 2 was followed by his younger brother emperor <br />  Virarajendra Chola on Chola throne. It appear during this time the <br />  viceroy of Anuruddha interfered with the privilages enjoyed by the <br />  Chola traders already trading in Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>  In this same period the king of Kadarem (present Kedah region of <br />  Malaysia) with the re-capture of this kingdom by the ruling king <br />of <br />  Sri Vijaya of that period, sought the assistance of Virarajendra <br />  Chola in regaining his kingdom. </p>
<p>  The emperor Virarajendra Chola sent an expedition in the year <br />  A.D.1068 under his nephew (sister's son) Kulothunga to help the <br />king <br />  of Kadarem in winning back his kingdom. Kulothunga Chola lead his <br />  great forces in person, and reached Rammanadesa on his way to <br />  Kadarem and defeated the viceroy of Anuruddha ruling from <br />  Tharehkiltara (Prome) and captured the Rammanadesa (Arumanam). </p>
<p>  However Kulothunga Chola re-instated the viceroy of Anuruddha at <br />  Rammanadesa on king Anuruddha agreeing to pay tributes to Cholas <br />and <br />  allowing the Chola traders to trade freely in this region. It <br />  appears Kulothunga Chola thereafter stationed a fleet of Chola <br />  forces at Thandaung east of Prome to look after the interests of <br />the <br />  Chola traders concentrated in this region. As a mark of his <br />victory <br />  over Rammanadesa Kulothunga Chola left two stone pillars of <br />  victory "jayastamba" at Prome. </p>
<p>  Period of Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1070 emperor Virarajendra Chola died, and his son <br />  Athirajendra Chola {A.D.1070-1073} succeeded on he Chola throne. </p>
<p>  During this period the king Vijayabahu - 1 (A.D.1059-1114) of Sri <br />  Lanka was struggling hard to relieve the northen half of his <br />country <br />  from the Chola domination. After many unsuccesfull efforts, few <br />  years before the year A.D.1071 he sent some envoys with rich <br />  presents to emperor Anuruddha of Arimaddanapur in Miyanmar, <br />  requesting for military assistance against Cholas. </p>
<p>  But Anuruddha probably realising the impending danger to his <br />growing <br />  empire, in the event he antagonised the mighty Cholas by providing <br />  forces to Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka, instead sent rich presents to <br />him <br />  including camphor and sandlewood in place of soldiers. </p>
<p>  Period of Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} </p>
<p>  Athirajendra Chola too died shortly thereafter in illness, which <br />  resulted in emperor Kulothunga Chola - 1 {A.D.1073-1123} ascending <br />  the Chola throne as the next successor in the year A.D.1073. </p>
<p>  In Sri Lanka Vijayabahu - 1 withstanding the decision made by <br />  Anuruddha, on his own waged war with the Cholas and successfully <br />  expelled them from Sri Lanka in the year A.D.1074, after a period <br />of <br />  nearly 72 years of their direct rule over the northern half of Sri <br />  Lanka. With this victory king Vijayabahu assumed the <br />  title "Chaththuru Chola kula anthaha". The new Chola emperor the <br />  Kulothunga Chola - 1 made no attempts in recovering the lost <br />  northern half of Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>  King Vijayabahu immediately after his victory over Cholas in <br />  A.D.1074 sent his envoys to Rammanadesa - which was now in the <br />  control of the Arimaddana king - requesting for twenty pious <br />elderly <br />  Buddhist monks versent in Pitaka, along with the religious books, <br />  and some sacred relics. King Anuruddha responded to this request <br />and <br />  sent learned Buddhist monks with copies of Pitaka who instituted a <br />  Nikaya (Sect) known as Rammana Nikaya to re-foster Buddhism in Sri <br />  Lanka. </p>
<p>  Emperor Anuruddha was followed by his son Sawulu on throne <br />  Arimaddanapur {A.D.1079-1084}. Towards the latter part of his rule <br />  the general Kyanzittha decided to get rid of the Chola forces <br />  stationed in Thandung and sent his forces to defeat them. However <br />  immediately after this incidence emperor Sawulu died and <br />Kyanzittha <br />  also known as Tribuwanaditya) (A.D.1084-1112), who was also a son <br />of <br />  Anurudda by his another queen - an Indian princess from Bengal - <br />  took over the throne at Arimaddanapur. </p>
<p>  At this time of his coronation the Kyanzitha's forces returned <br />back <br />  saying they have conquered the Indian country of Thandaung and Nga <br />  Thon Pinle (thickly populated Miyanmar regions with Chola - <br />Traders <br />  and forces) in the present Pegu division, and captured the Tamil <br />  Chola (Tamil Indian) warriors stationed in this region, who were <br />now <br />  settled in another region named Singu east of Arimaddanapur <br />possibly <br />  under captivity. </p>
<p>  Some years after A.D.1084 it appears Kulothunga Chola sent an army <br />  under a Chola prince to one of the ports of Rammanadesa to avenge <br />  the capture of Chola forces, and king Kyanzitha now without <br />  antogonising the Chola prince sent tributes and warmely welcomed <br />  him, possibly released the Chola warriors under captivity, and <br />took <br />  time to appraise him on the great religion of Buddhism who <br />  apparently adhered to the Buddhist religion. </p>
<p>  The Chola Prince in strengthening his friendship with the <br />  Arimaddanapura kingdom also gave his daughter in marriage to <br />  Kyanzittha, thus smoothening the relations of the Cholas with the <br />  Arimaddanpur kingdom of Miyanmar. The name of this Chola prince <br />and <br />  his daughter given in marriage to Kyanzittha is not known. </p>
<p>  It appears during this period with the newly builtup relations the <br />  traders from the Tamil Nadu and the other countries of the Chola <br />  empire, became very free to trade as far as Arimaddanapur the <br />  capital city of Kyanzitha in central Miyanmar region, and they <br />were <br />  also able to build a Vishnu temple at Arimaddanapur without any <br />  hinderance in the very heart of a Buddhist country named <br />  as "Nanadesi Vinnagar Alvar Koyil". </p>
<p>  Some years later a trader named "Irayiran Sriyananana Kulasekara <br />  Nambiyar" from Mahodayapuram (present Cranganore) of the <br />  Malaimandalam (the present Kerala state) of South India - the <br />former <br />  capital city of the Chera kingdom which was at that time under the <br />  rule of the Chola empire - built a sacred mandapa (hall), gave a <br />  sacred door to same, and one standing lamp to burn constantly in <br />the <br />  mandapa of this temple. </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1106 Kyanzittha sent envoys to to pay tributes to <br />  the Chinese emperor Hui Tsung (A.D.1101-1126) of the Sung Empire. <br />  The emperor orderd the envoys to be provided the same rank and <br />  ceremony as to the envoys from the Chola country. But the grand <br />  council advised "....the Chola country is subject to Sri Vijaya. <br />  During the hsi-ning period (A.D.1068-79) imperial decrees were <br />  addressed to it on thick-backed paper and enclosed in box and <br />  wrapper. Now Pukan Arimaddanapur) is a big kingdom. We cannot look <br />  down on it as an ordinary little dependent kingdom. We desire to <br />  adopt the same protocal as in the case of the Ta-shih (Arabs), <br />Chiao-<br />  chih (Annam) etc to whom imperial appointments and decrees were <br />all <br />  written on white-backed, gold flowered, damask paper, and stored <br />in <br />  a partly gold gilt tube with key and forwarded in a brocade silk <br />  double wrapper as sealing envelope ? The emperor approved....." </p>
<p>  Emperor Kyanzittha was followed by his grandson Alaungsithu <br />  (A.D.1112-1187) on the Arimaddanapur throne. </p>
<p>  Period Vikkrama Chola {A.D.1118 -1135} &amp; Kulothunga Chola -2 <br />  {A.D.1133-1150} </p>
<p>  It appears the good relations the Arimaddanapur kingdom had with <br />  Cholas continued for some time even after Kulothunga Chola ? 1, <br />  during the period of rule of Vikkrama Chola and Kulothunga Chola ? <br />  2. </p>
<p>  Period of Rajaraja Chola ? 2 {A.D.1146-1163} </p>
<p>  However during the rule of Rajaraja-2 we note, among the distant <br />  lands which sent tributes to the Chola country is the Pappalam the <br />  seaport city of Rammanadesa. </p>
<p>  However the fact remains that there had been continuos sea traffic <br />  on account of trade between TamilNadu and the Miyanmar kingdoms <br />even <br />  thereafter, and we note in the year A.D.1178 Chinese traders being <br />  aware that one who wishes to go to the Chola kingdom from China, <br />has <br />  to either tranship from Kollam kingdom or go there from the Pukan <br />  (Arimaddanapur) kingdom. This clearly indicates the extent of <br />trade <br />  activities between China, Pukan and Chola country. </p>
<p>  Period of Pandiyas after Medieval Cholas </p>
<p>  Even after the fall of Chola empire and the re-surgence of the <br />  Pandiyan empire, we note Pandiyan kings having relations with <br />  Arumanam the Rammanadesa of the Miyanmar country. </p>
<p>  Maravarman Sundarapandiyan ? 2 {A.D.1238-1251} claims to be the <br />  overlord of the king of Poppalam (Pappalam), and Sadaiyavarman <br />  Sunderapandiyan {A.D.1251-1271} claims having received tributes <br />from <br />  Arumanam. However the Pandiya relations with Miyanmar country is <br />  left out for further research study as it does not fall within the <br />  scope of the title of this essay.</p>

<p>      Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>      Nice posting.  <br />      But we are getting into heavy History discussion.<br />      Let us load the facts and discuss leisurely in phases.</p>
<p>      We may have to ascertain that :</p>
<p>      1 :: Vijayalaya conquored Sattan Pazhiyili - Mutharaya. This <br />is <br />      because of Vijayalachozeeswaram inscription in Narathamalai, <br />  found <br />      near Pazhuyileeswaram, built by Sattan Pazhiyili Mutharayar.  <br />  This <br />      is widely discussed discrepancy and refer our Archieves too.</p>
<p>      A couple of years back I have quoted Senthalai (near <br />      Thirukattuppalli - Nemam ) inscriptions and pointed out that <br />    Kavaran <br />      Maaran and Co., were the Mutharayas of Vijayala period..who <br />    occupied <br />      Thanjai and in effect there were Two Mutharayas sect, one from <br />      Thanjai and other from Narathamalai, who took sides with <br />Chozhas <br />    and <br />      Pandyas respectively suiting political winds, which is not <br />    uncommon.</p>
<p>      Pls go through the archieves.  </p>
<p>      2. Kandadithar was NOT in 63 Nayanmars. Because nayarnmar <br />    varalaru <br />      was based on Nambiandar Nambi's Thiruthondarthogai, which <br />paved <br />    way <br />      for Periyapuranam of Sekkizhar. Kandradithar's Thiruvisappa <br />    figured <br />      in the 12th Thirumurai- which compilation was around that <br />period.<br />      Nayanamars period : 7th to 9th Century. There are very <br />  interesting <br />      facts related to this. We will discuss leisurely what is NOT <br />      already found in the WEB.</p>
<p>      3. Vijayalaya BUILDS or OCCUPIES a Capital at Thanjai ?</p>
<p>      These queries will prove that we do not have properly recorded <br />      History. At the same, the DEDUCED History is also NOT MUCH <br />LET <br />    OUT.</p>
<p>      We are confronting with TWO VITAL issues now:</p>
<p>      1. Should we put Kachcha History (like what we have in the <br />Web ) <br />    and <br />      discuss each and every point.. OR</p>
<p>      2. Should we Wait for REFINED (TRUE) HISTORY alone. ?</p>
<p>      Who will Certify ?</p>
<p>      Therefore, in bits, we can look at Kachcha History data, open <br />to <br />      various view points and where possible reach some <br />  understanding... <br />      and if not, let us have the pleasure of exchanging views ..</p>
<p>      My humble request, pls do post this in some File .. later on <br />we <br />    can <br />      incorporate our observations as Foot notes atleast.</p>

<p>        cholas and srilanka</p>
<p>        (1) The Re-Emergence of the Chola Kingdom </p>
<p>      Cholas <br />        gradually re-emerged as a powerful ruling dynasty of <br />  Tamilnadu, <br />        after a long spell of nearly six centuries both in political <br />        obscurity and as feudatory of the Kalabra, Pallava and <br />Pandiya <br />        dynasties of South India. </p>
<p>        (2) Vijayalaya Chola reigns from his capital Palaiyarai in <br />      Tamilnadu </p>
<p>        In the line of these Cholas sprung king Vijayalaya Chola <br />    (A.D.849-<br />        881) ruling a small central region of the present Tamilnadu <br />    state <br />        with his capital at Palaiyarai, and as a feudatory of the <br />    Pallava <br />        king Nandivarman - 3 (A.D.826-850). </p>
<p>        (3) Vijayalaya Chola builds his new capital at Thanjavur </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.852 Vijayalaya Chola waged war with the <br />      Muttaraiyar <br />        king Sattan Paliyilli (A.D.826-852) in the neighbouring <br />east, <br />    and <br />        captured his territory of Thanjavur. </p>
<p>        Vijayalaya Chola built his new capital at Thanjavur with all <br />        facilities of a city commencing with the construction of a <br />    temple <br />      to <br />        the Goddess Kali named as Nisumbasudani. The Chola country <br />of <br />    this <br />        period covered the central and the eastern regions of the <br />    present <br />        Tamilnadu state. </p>
<p>        (4) King of Sri Lanka awaits to avenge the invasion of his <br />    country <br />        by Pandiya </p>
<p>        During this period the Sri Lankan king Sena-2 (A.D.851-885) <br />  was <br />        awaiting an opportune moment to avenge the devastation and <br />      disgrace <br />        caused to Sri Lanka by an earlier invasion of the Pandiya <br />king <br />        Srimara Sri Vallaba (A.D.835-862) which took place during <br />the <br />    rule <br />        of Sena-1(A.D.831-851). </p>
<p>        (5) Rebellious son of Pandiya seeks help from Sri Lanka </p>
<p>        Towards this time a son of Srimara Sri Vallaba by one of his <br />    other <br />        queens, named Maya Pandiya claimed rights to succession <br />  against <br />        Varaguna Pandiya-2 the legitimate heir to the throne by the <br />    chief <br />        queen of Srimara Sri Vallaba. This son with dissension with <br />  his <br />        father over same resolved to take over the Pandiya kingdom <br />to <br />        himself and went to Sri Lanka to seek the assistance of the <br />  king <br />        Sena-2. </p>
<p>        (6) Sri Lankan forces invades and captures the Pandiya <br />country </p>
<p>        Taking opportunity of the prevailing conditions, the king of <br />  Sri <br />        Lanka the Sena-2 sent a large army under his general named <br />      Kutthaka, <br />        who crossed seas from the port of Mahatittha the present <br />  Mantota <br />      and <br />        invaded the Pandiya country in the year A.D.862, killed <br />  Srimara <br />      Sri <br />        Vallaba laid waste the region, and captured the capital city <br />  of <br />      the <br />        Pandiya the Madurai. However Varaguna Pandiya - 2 escaped <br />    capture <br />        and went into hiding. </p>
<p>        (7) The Sri Lankan forces crown the rebellious son on the <br />    Pandiya <br />        throne </p>
<p>        The Sri Lankan forces thereafter anointed as the king the <br />      rebellious <br />        son of Srimara Sri Vallaba the Maya Pandiya who seeked their <br />        assistance to gain the throne, and returned to Sri Lanka <br />with <br />    much <br />        of the earlier lost treasures of the Sinhala country. </p>
<p>        (8) Pallava king Nirupatunga assists Varaguna to regain <br />throne </p>
<p>        Varaguna Pandiya-2 requested the assistance of the Pallava <br />  king <br />        Nirupatunga (A.D.850-882) to retrieve his throne. The <br />Pallava <br />    king <br />        along with Vijayalaya Chola and his allies invaded and <br />  defeated <br />      the <br />        rebellious son of Pandiya and drove away the remaining <br />Sinhala <br />        forces and reinstated Varaguna Pandiya - 2 (A.D.862-880) on <br />    throne <br />        at Madurai in the year A.D.862. </p>
<p>        (9) Athiththa Chola ascends the Chola throne </p>
<p>        Vijayalaya Chola appointed his son Athiththa Chola (A.D.871-<br />  907) <br />      as <br />        his co-regent in the year A.D.871. He succeeded on the Chola <br />      throne <br />        at Thanjavur in the year A.D.881 with the demise of <br />Vijayalaya <br />        Chola. </p>
<p>        (10) Athiththa Chola recovers the regions of the Chola <br />country </p>
<p>        During his period in the year A.D.880 Varaguna Pandiya - 2 <br />  waged <br />      war <br />        with the Pallava king Nirupathunga successor to Nandivarman, <br />    with <br />        whom he had friendly relations earlier. The Athitha Chola <br />    assited <br />        the Pallavas against Pandiya in this war at Thiruppurambiam. <br />  The <br />        Pallavas won the battle and Athiththa Chola too was <br />benefitted <br />    by <br />        being able to recover the entire Chola country. In the year <br />  A.D. <br />      890 <br />        he invaded and captured the Thondainadu and put an end to <br />the <br />        Pallava dynasty with Aparajitha (A.D.882-890) the son of <br />        Nirupathunga. </p>
<p>        (11) Paranthaha Chola captures the Pandiya kingdom </p>
<p>        Athiththa died while in Thondainadu, and was suceeded by his <br />  son <br />        king Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-954) at Thanjavur, who in the <br />    year <br />        A.D.910 captured the Pandiya country the southern region of <br />  the <br />        present Tamil Nadu state. The Pandiya king Rajasimhan-3 <br />  (A.D.905-<br />        921) few years after his defeat, escaped from his hiding to <br />  Sri <br />        Lanka and requested the Sinhala king Kasyappa-5 (A.D.913-<br />923) <br />  to <br />        assist him in regaining his kingdom. </p>
<p>        (12) Pandiya King's second battle with Paranthaha Chola </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.919 king Kasyappa sent a large Sinhala force <br />    under <br />        his general Saka Senapathi to assist Rajasimhan to recapture <br />  his <br />        kingdom. However Paranthaha's forces along with the forces <br />of <br />    his <br />        ally the Kannada king Piruthivi-2, defeated the combined <br />  forces <br />    of <br />        Pandiya and the Sinhala forces, in a deadly battle at <br />Vellur. </p>
<p>        (13) Pandiya King escapes to Sri Lanka with Regalia </p>
<p>        However the Pandiya king Rajasimhan escaped capture by <br />Cholas, <br />    and <br />        went to Sri Lanka with his crown and the other royal <br />insignia <br />    and <br />        took shelter in the Sinhala kingdom. He seeked further <br />    assistance <br />        from the new Sinhala king Dappula-4 (A.D.923-934) in <br />regaining <br />    his <br />        kingdom. He on not receiving favourable response from <br />Dappula-<br />  4 <br />      due <br />        to heavy repraisels from his nobles against same, left back <br />  his <br />        crown and insignia with him, and took asylum in the Chera <br />    country <br />        the present south Kerala state. </p>
<p>        (14) Paranthaha Chola wages war with Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>        Paranthaha Chola now requested the next successor to the Sri <br />    Lanka <br />        throne the Udaya-3 (A.D.934-937) to return the Pandiya crown <br />  and <br />        insignia, and on the latter's refusal Paranthaha in the year <br />      A.D.944 <br />        crossed seas to Sri Lanka, and defeated the king Udaya-3 who <br />        retreated from his capital Anuradhapura to Rohana in south <br />Sri <br />      Lanka <br />        with the Pandiyan treasure. </p>
<p>        (15) Paranthaha Chola fails in his mission </p>
<p>        Paranthaha finding difficult to penetrate into Rohana <br />returned <br />    to <br />        Chola country with much booty and treasures from Lanka, but <br />      failing <br />        in his mission to retrieve the Pandiyan crown and royal <br />  insignia <br />        from king Udaya-3. However Paranthaha with the defeat of the <br />      Sinhala <br />        king assumed the new title the Singhalanthahan. </p>
<p>        (16) Gandarathiththa Chola looses Pandiya Country </p>
<p>        Paranthaha-1 was suceeeded on the Chola throne at Thanjavur <br />by <br />    his <br />        second son Gandarathiththa Chola (A.D.950-957), who spent <br />  almost <br />      his <br />        entire period of rule in spiritualism as an ardent Saivite, <br />  and <br />        finally was counted as one of the 63 great Saiva Saints of <br />        TamilNadu. </p>
<p>        (17) Arinjaya's short rule of Chola kingdom </p>
<p>        He was followed by his younger brother Arinjaya Chola <br />(A.D956-<br />    957) <br />        at Thanjavur, who had very short rule. </p>
<p>        (18) Chola Forces goes to Sri Lanka to assist the Commander <br />  Sena </p>
<p>        He was followed by his son Sundera Chola (A.D.957-973) on <br />the <br />      throne <br />        at Thanjavur. During this period the Sri Lankan commander <br />with <br />      much <br />        animosity with his own king Sena-5 (A.D972-981) came to <br />Chola <br />        country and seeked military assistance from Sundera Chola, <br />who <br />      sent <br />        as much as 95,000 troops to Sri Lanka led by thr Chola <br />General <br />        Paranthahan Siriya Velan in A.D.954. </p>
<p>        (19) Chola General Meets his death in the battle in Sri <br />Lanka </p>
<p>        In this battle Sena-5 was defeated and escaped to Rohana, <br />but <br />    the <br />        Chola commander met his death which made the forces to <br />return <br />  to <br />        their country. </p>
<p>        (20) Rule of Utthama Chola </p>
<p>        After the death of Sundera Chola in A.D.973 the lawful <br />  successor <br />        prince Rajaraja Chola gave way to his paternal uncle Utthama <br />    Chola <br />        (A.D.973-985) who was craving for the Chola throne, on the <br />        understanding that the succession to the throne at Thanjavur <br />  to <br />    be <br />        passed on to prince Rajaraja after the death of Utthama <br />Chola. </p>
<p>        (21) Rajaraja-1 succeeds on the Chola throne </p>
<p>        Likewise in the the year A.D.985 Rajaraja - 1 came into <br />power. <br />        During this period in Sri Lanka king Mahinda-V (A.D.981-<br />1029) <br />      ruling <br />        from Anuradhapura in the wake of an internal rebellion by <br />the <br />      Kerala <br />        mercineries of his troops retreated to Rohana in A.D.991, <br />and <br />        continued to rule the southern half of the island. </p>
<p>        This left the northern half in turmoil with no king for <br />nearly <br />        eleven years with various chieftains yeilding power from <br />time <br />  to <br />        time over territories in this region and a state of anarchy <br />        prevailed. Rajaraja taking advantage of the situation <br />crossed <br />    seas <br />        and invaded Sri Lanka in his seventeenth year the A.D.1002. <br />  His <br />        great army known as "muntrukai mahasenai' sacked the seaport <br />    city <br />      of <br />        Mathottam the present Mantota and the interior capital of <br />        Anuradhapura, and annexed the northen half of the island to <br />  his <br />        empire. </p>
<p>        Rajaraja too on his victory over the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka <br />      assumed <br />        the a new title as Sinhalanthahan, and a village in <br />Thanjavur <br />  in <br />        Tamilnadu was named after this title as <br />Singalanthahacchcheri. </p>
<p>        (22) Polonnaruwa made the Chola capital in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>        He named the captured northern half of Sri Lanka as Mummudi-<br />        Cholamandalam after another of his titles, and further <br />divided <br />    and <br />        named them into various provinces. The present Polonnaruwa <br />  which <br />        formed a part of the province Nigarili Cholavalanadu was <br />made <br />    the <br />        new capital of his island territorial possessions and was <br />  named <br />    as <br />        Jananathamangalam also known as Jananathapuram. </p>
<p>        (23) Tamil Trading Settlements established in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>        During this period of Chola occupation the Tamil trading <br />  guilds <br />        Thisaiayiratthu Annuruvar also known as Nanadesi <br />  Thisaiayirathu <br />        Annuruvar and Nanadesis, the Valanjiyar and Nagaratthar who <br />  were <br />        already trading in Sri Lanka further increased their <br />  activities <br />    in <br />        the Island. </p>
<p>        At Kataneri the present Vahalkade in the Anuradhapura <br />district <br />    the <br />        guild of Thisaiayyiratththu Annuruvar established a <br />mercantile <br />      town <br />        known as Virapattinam. Among the members of this guild was a <br />      trader <br />        of high rank named Kanavathi Cholan alias Mavittamuriparan, <br />a <br />      Chetti <br />        trader from Java and an officer in charge of a mint in this <br />    town. </p>
<p>        At Padaviya in the Anuradhapura district too there was a <br />  trading <br />        establishment of this guild , and also a Siva temple in this <br />    area <br />        under their protection. One of the traders here too was of a <br />    high <br />        rank in the trading guild named Uththama Cholan alias <br />  Mandalattu <br />        Chetti, and another named Kottaikutpatan Cholan alias <br />Kollarun <br />        Cinkan. </p>
<p>        At Viharehinna near Moragolla in north Matale district <br />        Thisaiayiratthu Annuruvar had established another mercantile <br />    town <br />        known as the Virapattinam. </p>
<p>        There had been further trading establishements of this guild <br />  at <br />        Ilakattu Eba in Chilaw district, and at Detiyamulla and <br />      Gaitenpitiya <br />        both in Kurunagala district. </p>
<p>        In Polonnaruwa near the Rankot Vihara there had been a <br />  Buddhist <br />        Vihare known as Bholapalli at the village Bahicintai under <br />the <br />        patronage of the guild of Thisaiayiraathu Annuruvar. </p>
<p>        (24) Chola officials build Hindu Temples in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>        During this period Chola Officials and Tamil traders built <br />  many <br />        Hindu Temples for worship of Siva and Vishnu in the northern <br />    half <br />      of <br />        Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>        A Siva temple was built at Jananathamangalam also known as <br />        Jananathpuram the present Polonnaruwa in the province of <br />    Nigarili <br />        Cholavalanadu alias Pulainari, and was named as <br />Vanavanmadevi <br />        Iswarem after the queen of Raja Raja - 1. </p>
<p>        They built another Sive temple at Padaviya in the <br />Anuradhapura <br />        disctrict and named it as Ravikulamaanikka Iswarem after one <br />  of <br />      the <br />        titles of Rajaraja. Many Chola officials and traders around <br />      fifteen <br />        of them have made endowements to this temple, and <br />Chenkulavan <br />        Katampan being one of them made donations in the year <br />  A.D.1005. </p>
<p>        A further Siva Temple was built at Padaviya and was named as <br />        Uththamar Koyil and there was also a brahmin settlement <br />      established <br />        in this area known as 'Sripathi grama' </p>

One of <br />    these <br />        highways was named as Rajaraja perumtheru. Another highway <br />  from <br />      this <br />        city lead to Arulmolithevavalanadu apparently the present <br />        Anuradhapura. </p>
<p>        The Chola Officers also built an irrigation tank near <br />        Iluppaikkadavai known as Cholamandalakkulam, north of <br />  Mathottam <br />    in <br />        the Mannar district. There had been many weaving looms in <br />this <br />      city <br />        and tax collectors collected tax on these weaving looms and <br />  for <br />        transport through the highways. </p>

<p>  southern <br />        half of Sri Lanka with his capital at Rohana under the royal <br />    name <br />        Vikkramabahu. He then planned to capture north Sri Lanka and <br />        advanced his forces towards this direction. </p>
<p>        Prince Rajadhiraja on behalf of his father Rajendra Chola <br />  acted <br />        swiftly and sent an expedition which defeated the <br />  Vikkramabahu's <br />        forces and captured his crown. Vikkramabahu however escaped <br />to <br />      south <br />        Sri Lanka and continued to rule from Rohana. </p>
<p>        (40) Continuation of Chola activities in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>        Cholas continued their hold on the northen half of Sri <br />Lanka. <br />      During <br />        this period the names of few Chola provinces in north Sri <br />  Lanka <br />      were <br />        changed. The district where the Velgam Vihare was situated <br />was <br />    re-<br />        named from Sathvayasa Ramyana Manavatinanadu to <br />      Abayasiriyathannadu, <br />        and from Melaithuru Sriyathan Parakesari valanadu to <br />    Rajendrasimha <br />        valanadu. </p>
<p>        It appears around this time time there had been a Buddhist <br />    temple <br />      at <br />        Auradhapura named Madhavan Makothai Palli to which Tamil <br />    Artisons <br />        etc jointly did renovations. </p>
<p>        It appears it was during this time the Cholas exacavated a <br />  tank <br />        named as Cholamandalakkulam on the east and in the close <br />    proximity <br />        to the present Iluppaikkadavai in Mannar district. </p>

<p>        Further during this same period it appears some donations <br />have <br />      been <br />        made to Vilvapathirar temple in the present Manangkerni in <br />the <br />        Trincomalee district by some <br />        Chola officials. </p>

<p>        He was followed by the ambitious Sinhala general Kitti who <br />was <br />    in <br />        turn killed by Mahalnakitti within eighty days and assumed <br />  power <br />      at <br />        Rohana. He ruled from here for three years upto A.D.1044. </p>

All his treasures were transported to the Chola <br />  kingdom <br />      and <br />        consequently he commited suicide. </p>
<p>        During this time Vikkrama Pandian the son of Mahalanakitti <br />  born <br />    to <br />      a <br />        Pandian queen from Tamilnadu fled to India. </p>

<p>        In the year A.D.1063 with the death of Rajendra Chola - 2, <br />        Virarajendra Chola ascended the throne as the next successor <br />  to <br />      the <br />        Chola empire. </p>
<p>        (55) Vijayabahu establishes himself at Rohana in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>        During this period in Sri Lanka a local Kesadhatu chief <br />named <br />        Kassapa set up his rule at Rohana with his seat at <br />Kataragama. <br />        (Kathirkamam). </p>
<p>        The Chola general stationed at Polonnaruwa not withstanding <br />  this <br />        sent an army to Kattaragama against Kasspa in which the <br />Chola <br />      forces <br />        were defeated and retreated to the north. Kassapa now set up <br />  his <br />        northern frontier at Rakkhapasana the present Rakwana and <br />  returd <br />      to <br />        Kattaragama. </p>
<p>        At this time the prince named Kitti the nephew of <br />Vikkramabahu <br />      with <br />        his seat at Sippathalaka also in Rohana was taking efforts <br />to <br />        establish himself in this province. But Kassayappa sent his <br />    forces <br />        to futile his attempt where he was defeated, and prince <br />Kitti <br />      became <br />        the ruler of Rohana with royal name Vijayabahu. </p>
<p>        He then made preparations to wage war with the Cholas in <br />north <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka, but Virarajendra ordered the Chola general <br />    Jeyamurinadalvar <br />        stationed at Polonnaruwa to invade Kataragama. The Chola <br />  forces <br />        plundered Kataragama, but Vijayabahu escaped capture and the <br />    Chola <br />        forces returned to Polonnaruwa. Vijayabahu again returned to <br />        Sippatthalaka with strong forces and gradually established <br />    himself <br />        in Rohona. </p>
<p>        (56) Vijayabahu seeks military aid from Burma </p>
<p>        He made fresh preparations to attack the Cholas, and sent a <br />  few <br />        years prior to A.D.1067 envoys with rich presents to king <br />      Anuruddha <br />        (A.D.1044-1077) of Pagan who was also the overlord of <br />    Rammanadesa <br />        both being in present Burma, requesting for military <br />  assistance <br />        against Cholas. </p>
<p>        King Anuruddha on the other hand with no intention to create <br />  any <br />        enmity with the powerful Cholas, and also to prevent any <br />  strain <br />    in <br />        relations with Sri lanka, sent instead many ships with <br />various <br />        valuable gifts to king Vijayabahu, who now changed his abode <br />  to <br />        Tambalagama. </p>
<p>        (57) Virarajendra sends fresh expedition to Sri Lanka </p>
<p>        During this period in north Sri Lanka many inhabitants grew <br />      hostile <br />        and paid no tributes to the Chola kingdom. Vijayabahu too <br />      continued <br />        with his attempts to oust Cholas from Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>        This made Virarajendra to send a fresh expedition to Sri <br />Lanka <br />    in <br />        the year A.D.1067 with many ships of large forces to the <br />port <br />  of <br />        Mathottam in north Sri Lanka under the general <br />      Kurukulaththaraiyan. </p>
<p>        He successfully brought the Mummudi Chola mandalam the <br />  northern <br />      half <br />        of Sri Lanka under the Chola control. He then proceeded to <br />    Rohana <br />        with his forces where two mighty warriors of Vijayabahu, <br />    Ravideva <br />        and Cala joined the Chola forces and fought against him. </p>
<p>        In this battle the Chola general Kurukulatharaiyan, and <br />  another <br />        commander lost their lives. This made Chola forces more <br />  furious <br />    in <br />        which Rohana again fell into the hands of the Cholas who <br />took <br />        Vijayabahu's queen captive with many treasures while he <br />  escaped <br />    to <br />        his hideout. Again the whole of Sri Lanka came under the <br />Chola <br />      rule. </p>
<p>        (58) Virarajendra issues gold coin in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>        Virarajendra issued a gold coin so debased as to be hardly <br />        distinguishable from silver having the legend Sri Rajendrah <br />in <br />        nagari letters and on the reverse the Chola tiger between <br />two <br />      lamps <br />        all under a canopy. </p>
<p>        (59) Virarajendra Chola appoints his heir apparent </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.1067 Virarajendra named his son Adhirajendra <br />    Chola <br />        as the heir apprarent to the Chola throne and a co-ruler of <br />  the <br />        empire. </p>
<p>        (60) Kulothunga Chola succeeds on the throne of the Chola <br />  Empire </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.1070 with the death of Viarajendra a <br />rebellion <br />        sparked off in the Chola country in which Adhirajendra was <br />        assasinated and a state of anrachy prevailed in the kingdom. </p>
<p>        His untimely death with no heir apparent to succeed paved <br />way <br />    for <br />        prince Rajendra of Vengi Nadu, as the next legitimate <br />  successor <br />    to <br />        the Chola throne through his maternal side in the year <br />  A.D.1071 <br />      with <br />        the royal title Kulothunga Chola. </p>
<p>        (61) Vijayabahu saves Sri Lanka from Chola imperialism </p>
<p>        During this period in Sri Lanka the king Vijayabahu who <br />  earlier <br />      hid <br />        in the south after his defeat at the hands of the Cholas, <br />      gradually <br />        establised himself at Mahanagahula in the present <br />Ambalangoda <br />  in <br />        south Sri Lanka, and struggled valiantly to relieve the <br />island <br />      from <br />        the long standing grip of Cholas. </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.1088 he sent two seperate armies with large <br />    forces <br />        simultaneously to the north-central province of Sri Lanka <br />    against <br />        the Chola forces. </p>
<p>        The first unit of his troops intially captured the Chola <br />      strongholds <br />        at the villages Muhunnuru, Badalatthagalla, Vapinagara, <br />      Buddhigama, <br />        Tilagulla, Mahagalla, all in the Dakkinadesa the present <br />      Kurunagala <br />        district and proceeded to Anuradhapura. Here too Chola <br />forces <br />    were <br />        defeated and the city of Anuradhapura was captured . These <br />    troops <br />        further perssued and defeated the Chola forces upto the <br />  seaport <br />    of <br />        Mathottam alias Mahathittha in Mannar district. </p>
<p>        The second unit of troops of Vijayabahu was directed to the <br />      eastern <br />        province avoiding the mountainous regions which defeated the <br />    Chola <br />        forces at Chagama in the south-central region of Sri lanka. <br />  When <br />        they reached Pullathinagara the present Polonnnaruwa the <br />  Sinhala <br />        generals requested Vijayabahu to join them quickly with <br />  further <br />        fresh forces. </p>
<p>        Vijayabahu highly taken up by the heroic deeds of his forces <br />        proceeded to Polonnaruwa with his valiant army from his town <br />        Mahanugala. After the brief stay on the way in the close <br />    vicinity <br />      of <br />        Mahiyangana Buddhist temple they reached Polonnaruwa along <br />  east <br />        coast. </p>
<p>        The Chola forces stationed at various places in the close <br />    vicinity <br />        all gathered immediately at Polonnaruwa and had a great <br />battle <br />      with <br />        Sinhala forces. Vijayabahu's two great warriors Ravideva and <br />    Cala <br />        who joined the Chola forces earlier against him, now re-<br />joined <br />        Vijayabahu and fought with determination to exterminate the <br />      Cholas, <br />        and ending up with the victory to Sinhala forces. </p>
<p>        Vijayabahu to commemorate his victory over Cholas in Sri <br />  Lanka, <br />        assumed the title "Satru Rajachola Kula-anthaha'. </p>
<p>        (62) Vijayabahu marries the Kanyakubja Pricess </p>
<p>        During this period the wife and the daughter of the north <br />  Indian <br />        king Jegathipala who were taken prisoners to Chola country <br />  after <br />        defeat at the hands of Rajadhiraja-1 earlier at Rohana, <br />  escaped <br />      from <br />        Chola country and came back to Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>        They met the king Vijayabahu who later married the daughter <br />        Leelawathie and took her as his first consort. </p>
<p>        (63) KulothungaChola attempts peace with Sri Lanka </p>
<p>        Kulothunga Chola on the reverse after a long weary <br />expedition <br />  in <br />      the <br />        far east seems to have decided to carry the balance regnal <br />  years <br />      in <br />        peace and refrained from reacting further. </p>
<p>        In confirming his friendly relations he sought the hands of <br />  the <br />      king <br />        Vijayabahu's sister Mitta, but Vijayabahu with much <br />animosity <br />        against Cholas preferred the Pandiya prince in marriage to <br />his <br />        sister who were long time allies of the Sri Lankan kings. </p>
<p>        (64) The beginning of the disintegration o the Chola empire </p>
<p>        The loss of Sri Lanka from the fold of the Cholas marked the <br />        beginning of the gradual disintegration of the Chola <br />overseas <br />      empire <br />        from its healm during the rule of Virarajendra. </p>
<p>        (65) King Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka plans war with Chola <br />country </p>
<p>        Kulothunga to strengthen the good relations with Sri Lanka <br />  sent <br />        envoys with rich presents to king Vijayabahu. during this <br />same <br />        period the Sinhala envoys who were on their way to Karnataka <br />      kingdom <br />        in the Indian Mailand were humiliated in the Chola country <br />by <br />    some <br />        natives. </p>
<p>        Vijayabahu to avenge his anger over this incidence <br />challenged <br />        Kulothunga for war through the same Chola envoys and <br />gathered <br />    his <br />        troops at the seaports of Mathottam and Mattikavatatittha in <br />  the <br />        present Mannar district in the year A.D.1089. </p>
<p>        The Velaikkara forces of Chola who choose to stay back in <br />Sri <br />      Lanka <br />        and serve the Sinhala king after their defeat by Vijayabahu <br />      earlier <br />        now revolted against him on his plan to wage war with their <br />        motherland. </p>
<p>        In the revolt they caused destruction around Pulaththinagara <br />  the <br />        present Polonnaruwa and captured the king's sister Mitta <br />with <br />    her <br />        three sons. Vijayabahu escaped rebels and moved to south. </p>
<p>        However he returned back with his son Virabahu to <br />  Pulaththinagra <br />        defeated the rebels, released Mitta and her sons and <br />  established <br />        himself as the sole king of Sri lanka. </p>
<p>        (66) King Vijayabahu revives ambition to wage war with <br />Cholas </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.1104 king Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka revived <br />his <br />        ambition to fight the Cholas and awaited their forces at the <br />    ports <br />        of Mannar in response to his challenge. However in the <br />absense <br />    of <br />        reaction from the Cholas he returned to his capital <br />  Polonnaruwa. </p>
<p>        (67) Velaikkara Forces undertake to protect the Buddhist <br />  temple </p>
<p>        King Vijayabahu in the year A.D.1114 ordered his official <br />Deva <br />        Senavirattar to construct a Buddhist temple at <br />Vijayarajapura. <br />    He <br />      on <br />        completion of same instructed the Velaikkara Forces of the <br />    Cholas <br />        that remained back in Sri Lanka to take charge of protecting <br />    this <br />        temple. </p>
<p>        All divisions of the Velaikkara forces, along with the <br />    Valanjiar, <br />        Nagaraththar and others took charge of this temple which was <br />    named <br />        as "Muntrukai Velaikkara Daladayaperumpalli", and jointly <br />      undertook <br />        the management and protection of this temple and all <br />villages <br />      given <br />        to it as endowment. This they confirmed in Tamil on a stone <br />  slab <br />        planted in the Polonnaruwa district and also on copper <br />plates. </p>
<p>        (68) Jayabahu succeeds Vijayabahu on Sinhala throne </p>
<p>        In the same year of A.D.1114 Vijayabahu died, and was <br />  succeeded <br />    by <br />        his brother Jayabahu as against the traditions of succession <br />  on <br />      Sri <br />        Lankan throne preventing Vikkramabahu - 2 the son of <br />  Vijayabahu <br />      from <br />        becoming the king. </p>
<p>        (69) Kulothunga gives his daughter in marraige to the Sri <br />  Lankan <br />        Prince </p>
<p>        Kulothunga with a view to strengthening the relations with <br />Sri <br />      Lanka <br />        after the death of Vijayabahu, gave away one of his <br />daughters <br />      namely <br />        Suthamallialvar in marriage to the prince Manabarna alias <br />        Viraperumal alias Virabahu the son of Mitta (the <br />Vijayabahu's <br />        sister) by a Pandian Prince. </p>
<p>        (70) Kulothunga appoints his heir apparent </p>
<p>        Kulothunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1115 appointed his son Vikkrama <br />    Chola <br />        (A.D.1118-1135) as his heir apparent to the Chola Throne who <br />        assisted him in the administration of the Chola empire. </p>
<p>        (71) Vikkramabahu's Officer provides Endowments to temple in <br />    India </p>
<p>        During this period Uiyavandhan Thiruvannamalaiyan alias <br />    Vijayabahu <br />        Masathunayan the chief officer of Vikkramabahu with the <br />    normalised <br />        relations of Cholas with Sri Lanka after the death of <br />    Vijayabahu, <br />        built a holy Pilgrims Rest named as Maheswaren Madam at <br />      Kondakarudu <br />        Dakkarama on the banks of Godavari river in the Andhra <br />Pradesh <br />    in <br />        India, situated near the temple of Narenthira Iswarem Udaiya <br />        Mahadevar. </p>
<p>        Later in the year A.D.1120 he gave black and brass utensils <br />to <br />        Bhimeshwarem Udaya Mahadevar at Periya Dakkarambi in the <br />        Guddhavadinadu a subdivision of Gangaikonda Cholavalanadu on <br />  the <br />        occasion of the solar eclipse. </p>
<p>        (72) Kulothunga's daughter gives endowments to Siva temple <br />in <br />    Sri <br />        Lanka </p>
<p>        In the year A.D.1122 Suthamallialvar daughter of Kulothunga <br />    Chola <br />      of <br />        the Chola country and the wife of Virapperumal who was the <br />son <br />    of <br />        Mitta (sister Vijayabahu) by a Pandyan king, made donations <br />to <br />    the <br />        Siva temple known as Vikkrama Calamega Iswarem in Magala <br />alias <br />        Vikkirama Calamegapura in the present Budumuttawa in <br />    Nikaweratiya <br />      in <br />        Sri Lanka. She donated ten kasu for maintaing the burning of <br />a <br />      lamp, <br />        and a standing brass lamp to this temple. </p>
<p>        The Chola Relations with Sri Lanka goes still further up to <br />  the <br />      last <br />        Chola king namely the Rajendra Chola - 3 (1246- 1279), which <br />    will <br />      be <br />        continued later.</p></vj_episteme@></p></sps10142004@></p></vj_episteme@></p></blockquote>

<p>    Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>    Nice posting.  <br />    But we are getting into heavy History discussion.<br />    Let us load the facts and discuss leisurely in phases.</p>
<p>    We may have to ascertain that :</p>
<p>    1 :: Vijayalaya conquored Sattan Pazhiyili - Mutharaya. This is <br />    because of Vijayalachozeeswaram inscription in Narathamalai, <br />found <br />    near Pazhuyileeswaram, built by Sattan Pazhiyili Mutharayar.  <br />This <br />    is widely discussed discrepancy and refer our Archieves too.</p>
<p>    A couple of years back I have quoted Senthalai (near <br />    Thirukattuppalli - Nemam ) inscriptions and pointed out that <br />  Kavaran <br />    Maaran and Co., were the Mutharayas of Vijayala period..who <br />  occupied <br />    Thanjai and in effect there were Two Mutharayas sect, one from <br />    Thanjai and other from Narathamalai, who took sides with Chozhas <br />  and <br />    Pandyas respectively suiting political winds, which is not <br />  uncommon.</p>
<p>    Pls go through the archieves.  </p>

Because nayarnmar <br />  varalaru <br />    was based on Nambiandar Nambi's Thiruthondarthogai, which paved <br />  way <br />    for Periyapuranam of Sekkizhar. Kandradithar's Thiruvisappa <br />  figured <br />    in the 12th Thirumurai- which compilation was around that period.<br />    Nayanamars period : 7th to 9th Century. There are very <br />interesting <br />    facts related to this. We will discuss leisurely what is NOT <br />    already found in the WEB.</p>
<p>    3. Vijayalaya BUILDS or OCCUPIES a Capital at Thanjai ?</p>
<p>    These queries will prove that we do not have properly recorded <br />    History. At the same, the DEDUCED History is also NOT MUCH LET <br />  OUT.</p>
<p>    We are confronting with TWO VITAL issues now:</p>
<p>    1. Should we put Kachcha History (like what we have in the Web ) <br />  and <br />    discuss each and every point.. OR</p>
<p>    2. Should we Wait for REFINED (TRUE) HISTORY alone. ?</p>
<p>    Who will Certify ?</p>
<p>    Therefore, in bits, we can look at Kachcha History data, open to <br />    various view points and where possible reach some <br />understanding... <br />    and if not, let us have the pleasure of exchanging views ..</p>
<p>    My humble request, pls do post this in some File .. later on we <br />  can <br />    incorporate our observations as Foot notes atleast.</p>
<p>    New members please feel free to participate..</p>

<p>      cholas and srilanka</p>
<p>      (1) The Re-Emergence of the Chola Kingdom </p>
<p>    Cholas <br />      gradually re-emerged as a powerful ruling dynasty of <br />Tamilnadu, <br />      after a long spell of nearly six centuries both in political <br />      obscurity and as feudatory of the Kalabra, Pallava and Pandiya <br />      dynasties of South India. </p>
<p>      (2) Vijayalaya Chola reigns from his capital Palaiyarai in <br />    Tamilnadu </p>
<p>      In the line of these Cholas sprung king Vijayalaya Chola <br />  (A.D.849-<br />      881) ruling a small central region of the present Tamilnadu <br />  state <br />      with his capital at Palaiyarai, and as a feudatory of the <br />  Pallava <br />      king Nandivarman - 3 (A.D.826-850). </p>
<p>      (3) Vijayalaya Chola builds his new capital at Thanjavur </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.852 Vijayalaya Chola waged war with the <br />    Muttaraiyar <br />      king Sattan Paliyilli (A.D.826-852) in the neighbouring east, <br />  and <br />      captured his territory of Thanjavur. </p>
<p>      Vijayalaya Chola built his new capital at Thanjavur with all <br />      facilities of a city commencing with the construction of a <br />  temple <br />    to <br />      the Goddess Kali named as Nisumbasudani. The Chola country of <br />  this <br />      period covered the central and the eastern regions of the <br />  present <br />      Tamilnadu state. </p>
<p>      (4) King of Sri Lanka awaits to avenge the invasion of his <br />  country <br />      by Pandiya </p>
<p>      During this period the Sri Lankan king Sena-2 (A.D.851-885) <br />was <br />      awaiting an opportune moment to avenge the devastation and <br />    disgrace <br />      caused to Sri Lanka by an earlier invasion of the Pandiya king <br />      Srimara Sri Vallaba (A.D.835-862) which took place during the <br />  rule <br />      of Sena-1(A.D.831-851). </p>
<p>      (5) Rebellious son of Pandiya seeks help from Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      Towards this time a son of Srimara Sri Vallaba by one of his <br />  other <br />      queens, named Maya Pandiya claimed rights to succession <br />against <br />      Varaguna Pandiya-2 the legitimate heir to the throne by the <br />  chief <br />      queen of Srimara Sri Vallaba. This son with dissension with <br />his <br />      father over same resolved to take over the Pandiya kingdom to <br />      himself and went to Sri Lanka to seek the assistance of the <br />king <br />      Sena-2. </p>
<p>      (6) Sri Lankan forces invades and captures the Pandiya country </p>
<p>      Taking opportunity of the prevailing conditions, the king of <br />Sri <br />      Lanka the Sena-2 sent a large army under his general named <br />    Kutthaka, <br />      who crossed seas from the port of Mahatittha the present <br />Mantota <br />    and <br />      invaded the Pandiya country in the year A.D.862, killed <br />Srimara <br />    Sri <br />      Vallaba laid waste the region, and captured the capital city <br />of <br />    the <br />      Pandiya the Madurai.

<p>      (7) The Sri Lankan forces crown the rebellious son on the <br />  Pandiya <br />      throne </p>
<p>      The Sri Lankan forces thereafter anointed as the king the <br />    rebellious <br />      son of Srimara Sri Vallaba the Maya Pandiya who seeked their <br />      assistance to gain the throne, and returned to Sri Lanka with <br />  much <br />      of the earlier lost treasures of the Sinhala country. </p>
<p>      (8) Pallava king Nirupatunga assists Varaguna to regain throne </p>
<p>      Varaguna Pandiya-2 requested the assistance of the Pallava <br />king <br />      Nirupatunga (A.D.850-882) to retrieve his throne. The Pallava <br />  king <br />      along with Vijayalaya Chola and his allies invaded and <br />defeated <br />    the <br />      rebellious son of Pandiya and drove away the remaining Sinhala <br />      forces and reinstated Varaguna Pandiya - 2 (A.D.862-880) on <br />  throne <br />      at Madurai in the year A.D.862. </p>
<p>      (9) Athiththa Chola ascends the Chola throne </p>
<p>      Vijayalaya Chola appointed his son Athiththa Chola (A.D.871-<br />907) <br />    as <br />      his co-regent in the year A.D.871. He succeeded on the Chola <br />    throne <br />      at Thanjavur in the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya <br />      Chola. </p>

<p>      During his period in the year A.D.880 Varaguna Pandiya - 2 <br />waged <br />    war <br />      with the Pallava king Nirupathunga successor to Nandivarman, <br />  with <br />      whom he had friendly relations earlier. The Athitha Chola <br />  assited <br />      the Pallavas against Pandiya in this war at Thiruppurambiam. <br />The <br />      Pallavas won the battle and Athiththa Chola too was benefitted <br />  by <br />      being able to recover the entire Chola country. In the year <br />A.D. <br />    890 <br />      he invaded and captured the Thondainadu and put an end to the <br />      Pallava dynasty with Aparajitha (A.D.882-890) the son of <br />      Nirupathunga. </p>
<p>      (11) Paranthaha Chola captures the Pandiya kingdom </p>
<p>      Athiththa died while in Thondainadu, and was suceeded by his <br />son <br />      king Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-954) at Thanjavur, who in the <br />  year <br />      A.D.910 captured the Pandiya country the southern region of <br />the <br />      present Tamil Nadu state. The Pandiya king Rajasimhan-3 <br />(A.D.905-<br />      921) few years after his defeat, escaped from his hiding to <br />Sri <br />      Lanka and requested the Sinhala king Kasyappa-5 (A.D.913-923) <br />to <br />      assist him in regaining his kingdom. </p>
<p>      (12) Pandiya King's second battle with Paranthaha Chola </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.919 king Kasyappa sent a large Sinhala force <br />  under <br />      his general Saka Senapathi to assist Rajasimhan to recapture <br />his <br />      kingdom. However Paranthaha's forces along with the forces of <br />  his <br />      ally the Kannada king Piruthivi-2, defeated the combined <br />forces <br />  of <br />      Pandiya and the Sinhala forces, in a deadly battle at Vellur. </p>
<p>      (13) Pandiya King escapes to Sri Lanka with Regalia </p>
<p>      However the Pandiya king Rajasimhan escaped capture by Cholas, <br />  and <br />      went to Sri Lanka with his crown and the other royal insignia <br />  and <br />      took shelter in the Sinhala kingdom. He seeked further <br />  assistance <br />      from the new Sinhala king Dappula-4 (A.D.923-934) in regaining <br />  his <br />      kingdom. He on not receiving favourable response from Dappula-<br />4 <br />    due <br />      to heavy repraisels from his nobles against same, left back <br />his <br />      crown and insignia with him, and took asylum in the Chera <br />  country <br />      the present south Kerala state. </p>
<p>      (14) Paranthaha Chola wages war with Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>      Paranthaha Chola now requested the next successor to the Sri <br />  Lanka <br />      throne the Udaya-3 (A.D.934-937) to return the Pandiya crown <br />and <br />      insignia, and on the latter's refusal Paranthaha in the year <br />    A.D.944 <br />      crossed seas to Sri Lanka, and defeated the king Udaya-3 who <br />      retreated from his capital Anuradhapura to Rohana in south Sri <br />    Lanka <br />      with the Pandiyan treasure. </p>
<p>      (15) Paranthaha Chola fails in his mission </p>
<p>      Paranthaha finding difficult to penetrate into Rohana returned <br />  to <br />      Chola country with much booty and treasures from Lanka, but <br />    failing <br />      in his mission to retrieve the Pandiyan crown and royal <br />insignia <br />      from king Udaya-3. However Paranthaha with the defeat of the <br />    Sinhala <br />      king assumed the new title the Singhalanthahan. </p>
<p>      (16) Gandarathiththa Chola looses Pandiya Country </p>
<p>      Paranthaha-1 was suceeeded on the Chola throne at Thanjavur by <br />  his <br />      second son Gandarathiththa Chola (A.D.950-957), who spent <br />almost <br />    his <br />      entire period of rule in spiritualism as an ardent Saivite, <br />and <br />      finally was counted as one of the 63 great Saiva Saints of <br />      TamilNadu. </p>
<p>      (17) Arinjaya's short rule of Chola kingdom </p>
<p>      He was followed by his younger brother Arinjaya Chola (A.D956-<br />  957) <br />      at Thanjavur, who had very short rule. </p>
<p>      (18) Chola Forces goes to Sri Lanka to assist the Commander <br />Sena </p>
<p>      He was followed by his son Sundera Chola (A.D.957-973) on the <br />    throne <br />      at Thanjavur. During this period the Sri Lankan commander with <br />    much <br />      animosity with his own king Sena-5 (A.D972-981) came to Chola <br />      country and seeked military assistance from Sundera Chola, who <br />    sent <br />      as much as 95,000 troops to Sri Lanka led by thr Chola General <br />      Paranthahan Siriya Velan in A.D.954. </p>

<p>      (20) Rule of Utthama Chola </p>
<p>      After the death of Sundera Chola in A.D.973 the lawful <br />successor <br />      prince Rajaraja Chola gave way to his paternal uncle Utthama <br />  Chola <br />      (A.D.973-985) who was craving for the Chola throne, on the <br />      understanding that the succession to the throne at Thanjavur <br />to <br />  be <br />      passed on to prince Rajaraja after the death of Utthama Chola. </p>
<p>      (21) Rajaraja-1 succeeds on the Chola throne </p>
<p>      Likewise in the the year A.D.985 Rajaraja - 1 came into power. <br />      During this period in Sri Lanka king Mahinda-V (A.D.981-1029) <br />    ruling <br />      from Anuradhapura in the wake of an internal rebellion by the <br />    Kerala <br />      mercineries of his troops retreated to Rohana in A.D.991, and <br />      continued to rule the southern half of the island. </p>
<p>      This left the northern half in turmoil with no king for nearly <br />      eleven years with various chieftains yeilding power from time <br />to <br />      time over territories in this region and a state of anarchy <br />      prevailed. Rajaraja taking advantage of the situation crossed <br />  seas <br />      and invaded Sri Lanka in his seventeenth year the A.D.1002. <br />His <br />      great army known as "muntrukai mahasenai' sacked the seaport <br />  city <br />    of <br />      Mathottam the present Mantota and the interior capital of <br />      Anuradhapura, and annexed the northen half of the island to <br />his <br />      empire. </p>
<p>      Rajaraja too on his victory over the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka <br />    assumed <br />      the a new title as Sinhalanthahan, and a village in Thanjavur <br />in <br />      Tamilnadu was named after this title as Singalanthahacchcheri. </p>
<p>      (22) Polonnaruwa made the Chola capital in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>      He named the captured northern half of Sri Lanka as Mummudi-<br />      Cholamandalam after another of his titles, and further divided <br />  and <br />      named them into various provinces. The present Polonnaruwa <br />which <br />      formed a part of the province Nigarili Cholavalanadu was made <br />  the <br />      new capital of his island territorial possessions and was <br />named <br />  as <br />      Jananathamangalam also known as Jananathapuram. </p>

<p>      Chola officers also consecrated the images of the deities of <br />      Pallikondar and Alahiya Manavalar at the temple of <br />    Vaanavanmadeviyar <br />      Iswarem in Polonnaruwa. </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1024 apparently a Chola Officer made <br />endowments <br />    for <br />      lighting of an oil lamp at the Velgam Vehare alias <br />      Rajarajaperumpalli at Sathvayasa Ramyana Manavatina naadu in <br />the <br />      present Trincomalee district. Another Chola native of the <br />  village <br />      Pakavan Puthukkudi in the north Sri Lanka named <br />  Athithaperraraiyan <br />      too made donation of 84 cows to maintain burning of a lamp at <br />  this <br />      Buddhist temple. In this same year Tariyanan Puvanatevan of <br />  Kollam <br />      granted one lamp and four kasu to Velgam Vehere as donation. </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1027 Pattaravita Raman of Manavattulakamam in <br />      Mevannanadu alias Parakesari valanadu granted 35 cows and 5 <br />      buffaloes to the Buddha in the temple of VelgamVehera alias <br />      Rajarajaperumpalli. </p>
<p>      (33) Chola conquest of whole of Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>      Rajendra Chola now turned his attention on his expeditions <br />    overseas <br />      and ambitious of suduing whole of Sri Lanka, in the year A.D. <br />  1017 <br />      sent an army led by the commander -in-chief and commissioner <br />      Jeyamkondan alias Muventha Velar which crossed over and <br />  conquered <br />      the southern half of Sri Lanka and brought the whole island <br />  under <br />      the Chola yoke. </p>
<p>      The king Mahinda-5 ruling the southern half of Sri Lanka was <br />      captured with his queen, daughter and articles of regalia, and <br />    taken <br />      prisoners to Chola kingdom by this Commander. </p>
<p>      (34) Chola Forces recover the Pandyan Regalia from Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>      The Chola Forces also recovered the items of Regalia and crown <br />  of <br />      the king Rajasimhan (A.D.900-920) of the Pandiya country in <br />      Tamilnadu which were earlier left by him with the Sri Lankan <br />  king <br />      Dappula-4 (A.D.923-934), after his defeat by the Cholas in <br />    A.D.1017. <br />      These items too were transported to the Chola country. </p>
<p>      (35) Rajendra Chola appoints a viceroy in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      Rajendra Chola appointed one of his sons as the viceroy in Sri <br />    Lanka <br />      with the title Ilangaiyarkku Iraivan who was also known as <br />Chola <br />      Ilangeswaren alias Sri Sangapanmar. The region in Polonnaruwa <br />    where <br />      he resided and ruled was known as Chola Samasthanam. <br />      (Solasamasthanaya of Polonnnaruwa). </p>
<p>      (36) Chola Emperer Rajendra issues new coinage in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      Rajendra during his rule of whole of Sri Lanka, issued gold <br />    coinage <br />      with the legend "Yuddha Malla" inscribed on them referring to <br />  him <br />    as <br />      a great warrior. </p>
<p>      (37) Chola avtivities in Sri Lanka during Rajendra Chola </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1020 a Chola General stationed in Sri Lanka <br />  known <br />    as <br />      Jeyamurinaadalver made some donations probaly to a Hindu <br />temple <br />  at <br />      the present Sangili karandava. </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1027 the member of the Permakkal probably made <br />    some <br />      donation at the Muttankai Koyil Perunguri of the Bramadesam <br />    Rajaraja <br />      Chathurvedimangalam of Rajendra Cholavalanadu alias <br />  Rajavitchadira <br />      valanadu. During the rule of Chola Illangeswaradevan some <br />    donations <br />      has been made to the temple Sri Macchukeswarem at Rajendra <br />Chola <br />      valanadu </p>
<p>      Chola officials also established settlements of Brahmin <br />priests <br />  on <br />      lands at Rajendra Cholavalanadu </p>
<p>      (38) Death of king Mahinda-V and loss of south Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      In Sri Lanka the king Mahinda-5 who was taken prisoner to the <br />    Chola <br />      country lived in captivity for twelve years and died in <br />  A.D.1029. </p>
<p>      With his death there rose a rebellion in Sri Lanka under <br />prince <br />      Kasiyappa against the Cholas, in which the Cholas lost hold of <br />  the <br />      southern territory after twelve years of rule over the whole <br />    island. </p>
<p>      (39) Vikkramabahu attempts capture of north Sri Lanka </p>
<p>southern <br />      half of Sri Lanka with his capital at Rohana under the royal <br />  name <br />      Vikkramabahu. He then planned to capture north Sri Lanka and <br />      advanced his forces towards this direction. </p>
<p>      Prince Rajadhiraja on behalf of his father Rajendra Chola <br />acted <br />      swiftly and sent an expedition which defeated the <br />Vikkramabahu's <br />      forces and captured his crown. Vikkramabahu however escaped to <br />    south <br />      Sri Lanka and continued to rule from Rohana. </p>
<p>      (40) Continuation of Chola activities in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      Cholas continued their hold on the northen half of Sri Lanka. <br />    During <br />      this period the names of few Chola provinces in north Sri <br />Lanka <br />    were <br />      changed. The district where the Velgam Vihare was situated was <br />  re-<br />      named from Sathvayasa Ramyana Manavatinanadu to <br />    Abayasiriyathannadu, <br />      and from Melaithuru Sriyathan Parakesari valanadu to <br />  Rajendrasimha <br />      valanadu. </p>
<p>      It appears around this time time there had been a Buddhist <br />  temple <br />    at <br />      Auradhapura named Madhavan Makothai Palli to which Tamil <br />  Artisons <br />      etc jointly did renovations. </p>
<p>      It appears it was during this time the Cholas exacavated a <br />tank <br />      named as Cholamandalakkulam on the east and in the close <br />  proximity <br />      to the present Iluppaikkadavai in Mannar district. </p>
<p>      In A.D.1033 (10th year) during the viceroyalty of Sri <br />  Sangavanmar <br />      Udayar Chola Ilangeswara, the officials of high office <br />  (perunguri <br />      perumakkal) of Rajraja Chathurvedimangalam encompassing the <br />    Rajendra <br />      cholavalandu and Rajavitchadira valanadu at the present <br />Kantalai <br />    in <br />      Trincomalee district, met at the Siva shrine known as <br />  Muththangai <br />      temple, and diiscussed and approved the plans for inprovising <br />  more <br />      facilities from the irrigation channel named Vikkrama Chola <br />    vaikkal <br />      named after one of Rajendra's titles. </p>
<p>      Further during this same period it appears some donations have <br />    been <br />      made to Vilvapathirar temple in the present Manangkerni in the <br />      Trincomalee district by some <br />      Chola officials. </p>
<p>      During this period another Siva temple which was built and <br />named <br />      after one of the titles of Rajendra Chola namely Panditha <br />Cholan <br />    as <br />      Paditha Choliswarem at Matalakiri, which was renamed as <br />      Nittavinodapuram the present Medirigiriya. </p>
<p>      In A.D.1037 a Tamil devotee Amuthan Chatan alias Kayavahu Kodi <br />    made <br />      donations of 10 cows and 10 oxen and ghee for lamp </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1040 one Arankan Ramesan had made an endowment <br />  50 <br />      coconut trees at Teliyalperu of Kallai, at present Atakada for <br />      lighting of sacred lamps and three velis of land </p>
<p>      He further donated 20 cows for 5 lamps at Utthamacholiswarem <br />ar <br />      Attakada.in A.D.1038 </p>
<p>      (41) Futher developments in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      In south Sri Lanka Vikkramabahu again made preparations for a <br />      further assault on the north, but died before his attempt in <br />the <br />      year a.D.1041. </p>
<p>      He was followed by the ambitious Sinhala general Kitti who was <br />  in <br />      turn killed by Mahalnakitti within eighty days and assumed <br />power <br />    at <br />      Rohana. He ruled from here for three years upto A.D.1044. </p>
<p>      (42) Rajendra Chola - 1 issues gold coins </p>
<p>      Rajendra issued a small Chola coin of base gold having on its <br />      obverse the Chola seated tiger flanked by the Pandiya fishes <br />and <br />    the <br />      Chera bow all under a canopy, and on the reverse with the <br />legend <br />      Yuddha Malla in the Nagari Script. </p>
<p>      (43) Rajadhiraja Chola -1 ascends on the throne of the Chola <br />    empire </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1044 Rajendra Chola died and was succeeded by <br />  his <br />      son Rajadhiraja Chola. At the time of his acension Sri Lanka <br />was <br />      still under the Cholas. </p>
<p>      Rajadhiraja appointed his brother as the viceroy king in north <br />  Sri <br />      Lanka with the title Illangaiyarkku Irraivan. </p>
<p>      (44) Rajadhiraja Chola sends fresh expeditions to south Sri <br />  Lanka </p>
<p>      In Sri Lanka in the year of A.D. 1044 Mahalanakitti had to <br />face <br />      fresh attacks of the Chola forces stationed in north Sri Lanka <br />  in <br />      which he was defeated and again Rohana fell into the hands of <br />  the <br />      Cholas. All his treasures were transported to the Chola <br />kingdom <br />    and <br />      consequently he commited suicide. </p>
<p>      During this time Vikkrama Pandian the son of Mahalanakitti <br />born <br />  to <br />    a <br />      Pandian queen from Tamilnadu fled to India. </p>
<p>      (45) Vikkrama Pandian attempts to regain Rohana </p>
<p>      However at a latter stage he came to Rohana from his hideout <br />in <br />      Tuluva country in India and was trying for three years to <br />    gradually <br />      eastablish himself over this territory. </p>
<p>      Rajadhiraja sent an expedition and defeated him in A.D.1047 <br />  where <br />    he <br />      lost his crown to Cholas, and went to his hiding in Rohana. </p>
<p>      (46) Rule of North Indian king in south Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      During this period the north Indian king Virasalamehan alias <br />      Jegathipala from Kanyakubja near present Ayodhiya came to Sri <br />    Lanka <br />      and captured Rohana, killed Vikkrama Pandian and ruled for a <br />    period <br />      of four years. </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1051 Rajadhiraja sent a further expedition <br />which <br />      defeated this North Indian king and captured Rohana again, <br />with <br />    his <br />      crown, queen, and daughter who were transported to the Chola <br />      kingdom. </p>
<p>      (47) Brahmins settled at Kantalai in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      During this period the Chola officers in Sri Lanka established <br />a <br />      settlement of Brahmin priests at Kantalai in the present <br />    Trincomalee <br />      district and named it as Jeyamkonda Chathurvedimangalam after <br />  one <br />    of <br />      the titles of Rajadhiraja. </p>
<p>      (48) Rajadhiraja appoints his heir apparent </p>
<p>      In the same year Rajadhiraja made his younger brother <br />Rajendra -<br />  2 <br />    as <br />      his heir apparent and co-ruler of the Chola empire. </p>
<p>      (49) Further Chola war in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      Again in Sri Lanka in A.D.1053 Parakrama Pandian alias Sri <br />  Vallaba <br />      Madanarajan the son of Vikkrama Pandian tried to release <br />Rohana <br />    from <br />      Chola sway. Rajadhiraja sent another expedition which killed <br />and <br />      captured his crown. </p>
<p>      (50) Rajendra Chola - 2 ascends on the Chola throne </p>
<p>      Rajadhiraja died in A.D.1054 in the battlefield in a war with <br />  the <br />      western Chalukiyas of the present Karnataka state in the <br />Indian <br />      mainland. His younger brother Rajendra -2 who was with him at <br />  the <br />      warfront proclaimed himself as the emperor , and crowned <br />himself <br />    as <br />      the successor to the Chola throne. </p>
<p>      (51) Rajendra Chola wages war with Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      In A.D. 1055 again fresh eruptions took place at Rohana in Sri <br />      Lanka. Manabarna a decendent of the earlier Sinhala king with <br />  the <br />      assistance of a Kalinga prince of India the Virasalamehan, was <br />      taking efforts to re-establish himself at Rohana. </p>
<p>      Rajendra sent an expedition to Sri Lanka defeated and killed <br />      Virasalamehan and took the two sons of Manabharna as captives. <br />  The <br />      general Jeyamurinadalvar was left in command of the Chola <br />forces <br />      stationed in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>      Rajendra Chola-2 issued a rare silver coin of the Sri Lanka <br />type <br />      showing on the obverse the legend Sri Rajendra in Nagari <br />letters <br />    and <br />      the Chola seated tiger on the reverse. </p>
<p>      (52) Other events during the rule of Rajendra Chola - 2 </p>
<p>      In he year A.D.1056 Valavan Pitan Caravan of the Ilaiya <br />Mummuti <br />      Chola Annukkar and of the Perumpatai granted 26 cows for <br />    maintaining <br />      a lamp granted in the name of his son Narayanan to the Lord of <br />      Padith Chola Iswarem. </p>
<p>      (53) Rajendra Chola - 2 names his heir apparent </p>
<p>      Rajendra in the year A.D.1062 named his youngest brother <br />      Virarajendra as his successor, with the premature death of his <br />    son, <br />      and his younger brother Rajamahendra. </p>
<p>      (54) Virarajendra Chola ascends throne as the next Chola <br />emperor </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1063 with the death of Rajendra Chola - 2, <br />      Virarajendra Chola ascended the throne as the next successor <br />to <br />    the <br />      Chola empire. </p>
<p>      (55) Vijayabahu establishes himself at Rohana in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      During this period in Sri Lanka a local Kesadhatu chief named <br />      Kassapa set up his rule at Rohana with his seat at Kataragama. <br />      (Kathirkamam). </p>
<p>      The Chola general stationed at Polonnaruwa not withstanding <br />this <br />      sent an army to Kattaragama against Kasspa in which the Chola <br />    forces <br />      were defeated and retreated to the north. Kassapa now set up <br />his <br />      northern frontier at Rakkhapasana the present Rakwana and <br />returd <br />    to <br />      Kattaragama. </p>
<p>      At this time the prince named Kitti the nephew of Vikkramabahu <br />    with <br />      his seat at Sippathalaka also in Rohana was taking efforts to <br />      establish himself in this province. But Kassayappa sent his <br />  forces <br />      to futile his attempt where he was defeated, and prince Kitti <br />    became <br />      the ruler of Rohana with royal name Vijayabahu. </p>
<p>      He then made preparations to wage war with the Cholas in north <br />  Sri <br />      Lanka, but Virarajendra ordered the Chola general <br />  Jeyamurinadalvar <br />      stationed at Polonnaruwa to invade Kataragama. The Chola <br />forces <br />      plundered Kataragama, but Vijayabahu escaped capture and the <br />  Chola <br />      forces returned to Polonnaruwa. Vijayabahu again returned to <br />      Sippatthalaka with strong forces and gradually established <br />  himself <br />      in Rohona. </p>
<p>      (56) Vijayabahu seeks military aid from Burma </p>
<p>      He made fresh preparations to attack the Cholas, and sent a <br />few <br />      years prior to A.D.1067 envoys with rich presents to king <br />    Anuruddha <br />      (A.D.1044-1077) of Pagan who was also the overlord of <br />  Rammanadesa <br />      both being in present Burma, requesting for military <br />assistance <br />      against Cholas. </p>
<p>      King Anuruddha on the other hand with no intention to create <br />any <br />      enmity with the powerful Cholas, and also to prevent any <br />strain <br />  in <br />      relations with Sri lanka, sent instead many ships with various <br />      valuable gifts to king Vijayabahu, who now changed his abode <br />to <br />      Tambalagama. </p>
<p>      (57) Virarajendra sends fresh expedition to Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      During this period in north Sri Lanka many inhabitants grew <br />    hostile <br />      and paid no tributes to the Chola kingdom. Vijayabahu too <br />    continued <br />      with his attempts to oust Cholas from Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>      This made Virarajendra to send a fresh expedition to Sri Lanka <br />  in <br />      the year A.D.1067 with many ships of large forces to the port <br />of <br />      Mathottam in north Sri Lanka under the general <br />    Kurukulaththaraiyan. </p>
<p>      He successfully brought the Mummudi Chola mandalam the <br />northern <br />    half <br />      of Sri Lanka under the Chola control. He then proceeded to <br />  Rohana <br />      with his forces where two mighty warriors of Vijayabahu, <br />  Ravideva <br />      and Cala joined the Chola forces and fought against him. </p>
<p>      In this battle the Chola general Kurukulatharaiyan, and <br />another <br />      commander lost their lives. This made Chola forces more <br />furious <br />  in <br />      which Rohana again fell into the hands of the Cholas who took <br />      Vijayabahu's queen captive with many treasures while he <br />escaped <br />  to <br />      his hideout. Again the whole of Sri Lanka came under the Chola <br />    rule. </p>
<p>      (58) Virarajendra issues gold coin in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      Virarajendra issued a gold coin so debased as to be hardly <br />      distinguishable from silver having the legend Sri Rajendrah in <br />      nagari letters and on the reverse the Chola tiger between two <br />    lamps <br />      all under a canopy. </p>
<p>      (59) Virarajendra Chola appoints his heir apparent </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1067 Virarajendra named his son Adhirajendra <br />  Chola <br />      as the heir apprarent to the Chola throne and a co-ruler of <br />the <br />      empire. </p>
<p>      (60) Kulothunga Chola succeeds on the throne of the Chola <br />Empire </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1070 with the death of Viarajendra a rebellion <br />      sparked off in the Chola country in which Adhirajendra was <br />      assasinated and a state of anrachy prevailed in the kingdom. </p>
<p>      His untimely death with no heir apparent to succeed paved way <br />  for <br />      prince Rajendra of Vengi Nadu, as the next legitimate <br />successor <br />  to <br />      the Chola throne through his maternal side in the year <br />A.D.1071 <br />    with <br />      the royal title Kulothunga Chola. </p>
<p>      (61) Vijayabahu saves Sri Lanka from Chola imperialism </p>
<p>      During this period in Sri Lanka the king Vijayabahu who <br />earlier <br />    hid <br />      in the south after his defeat at the hands of the Cholas, <br />    gradually <br />      establised himself at Mahanagahula in the present Ambalangoda <br />in <br />      south Sri Lanka, and struggled valiantly to relieve the island <br />    from <br />      the long standing grip of Cholas. </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1088 he sent two seperate armies with large <br />  forces <br />      simultaneously to the north-central province of Sri Lanka <br />  against <br />      the Chola forces. </p>
<p>      The first unit of his troops intially captured the Chola <br />    strongholds <br />      at the villages Muhunnuru, Badalatthagalla, Vapinagara, <br />    Buddhigama, <br />      Tilagulla, Mahagalla, all in the Dakkinadesa the present <br />    Kurunagala <br />      district and proceeded to Anuradhapura. Here too Chola forces <br />  were <br />      defeated and the city of Anuradhapura was captured . These <br />  troops <br />      further perssued and defeated the Chola forces upto the <br />seaport <br />  of <br />      Mathottam alias Mahathittha in Mannar district. </p>
<p>      The second unit of troops of Vijayabahu was directed to the <br />    eastern <br />      province avoiding the mountainous regions which defeated the <br />  Chola <br />      forces at Chagama in the south-central region of Sri lanka. <br />When <br />      they reached Pullathinagara the present Polonnnaruwa the <br />Sinhala <br />      generals requested Vijayabahu to join them quickly with <br />further <br />      fresh forces. </p>
<p>      Vijayabahu highly taken up by the heroic deeds of his forces <br />      proceeded to Polonnaruwa with his valiant army from his town <br />      Mahanugala. After the brief stay on the way in the close <br />  vicinity <br />    of <br />      Mahiyangana Buddhist temple they reached Polonnaruwa along <br />east <br />      coast. </p>
<p>      The Chola forces stationed at various places in the close <br />  vicinity <br />      all gathered immediately at Polonnaruwa and had a great battle <br />    with <br />      Sinhala forces. Vijayabahu's two great warriors Ravideva and <br />  Cala <br />      who joined the Chola forces earlier against him, now re-joined <br />      Vijayabahu and fought with determination to exterminate the <br />    Cholas, <br />      and ending up with the victory to Sinhala forces. </p>
<p>      Vijayabahu to commemorate his victory over Cholas in Sri <br />Lanka, <br />      assumed the title "Satru Rajachola Kula-anthaha'. </p>
<p>      (62) Vijayabahu marries the Kanyakubja Pricess </p>
<p>      During this period the wife and the daughter of the north <br />Indian <br />      king Jegathipala who were taken prisoners to Chola country <br />after <br />      defeat at the hands of Rajadhiraja-1 earlier at Rohana, <br />escaped <br />    from <br />      Chola country and came back to Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>      They met the king Vijayabahu who later married the daughter <br />      Leelawathie and took her as his first consort. </p>
<p>      (63) KulothungaChola attempts peace with Sri Lanka </p>
<p>      Kulothunga Chola on the reverse after a long weary expedition <br />in <br />    the <br />      far east seems to have decided to carry the balance regnal <br />years <br />    in <br />      peace and refrained from reacting further. </p>
<p>      In confirming his friendly relations he sought the hands of <br />the <br />    king <br />      Vijayabahu's sister Mitta, but Vijayabahu with much animosity <br />      against Cholas preferred the Pandiya prince in marriage to his <br />      sister who were long time allies of the Sri Lankan kings. </p>
<p>      (64) The beginning of the disintegration o the Chola empire </p>
<p>      The loss of Sri Lanka from the fold of the Cholas marked the <br />      beginning of the gradual disintegration of the Chola overseas <br />    empire <br />      from its healm during the rule of Virarajendra. </p>
<p>      (65) King Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka plans war with Chola country </p>
<p>      Kulothunga to strengthen the good relations with Sri Lanka <br />sent <br />      envoys with rich presents to king Vijayabahu. during this same <br />      period the Sinhala envoys who were on their way to Karnataka <br />    kingdom <br />      in the Indian Mailand were humiliated in the Chola country by <br />  some <br />      natives. </p>
<p>      Vijayabahu to avenge his anger over this incidence challenged <br />      Kulothunga for war through the same Chola envoys and gathered <br />  his <br />      troops at the seaports of Mathottam and Mattikavatatittha in <br />the <br />      present Mannar district in the year A.D.1089. </p>
<p>      The Velaikkara forces of Chola who choose to stay back in Sri <br />    Lanka <br />      and serve the Sinhala king after their defeat by Vijayabahu <br />    earlier <br />      now revolted against him on his plan to wage war with their <br />      motherland. </p>
<p>      In the revolt they caused destruction around Pulaththinagara <br />the <br />      present Polonnaruwa and captured the king's sister Mitta with <br />  her <br />      three sons. Vijayabahu escaped rebels and moved to south. </p>
<p>      However he returned back with his son Virabahu to <br />Pulaththinagra <br />      defeated the rebels, released Mitta and her sons and <br />established <br />      himself as the sole king of Sri lanka. </p>
<p>      (66) King Vijayabahu revives ambition to wage war with Cholas </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1104 king Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka revived his <br />      ambition to fight the Cholas and awaited their forces at the <br />  ports <br />      of Mannar in response to his challenge. However in the absense <br />  of <br />      reaction from the Cholas he returned to his capital <br />Polonnaruwa. </p>
<p>      (67) Velaikkara Forces undertake to protect the Buddhist <br />temple </p>
<p>      King Vijayabahu in the year A.D.1114 ordered his official Deva <br />      Senavirattar to construct a Buddhist temple at Vijayarajapura. <br />  He <br />    on <br />      completion of same instructed the Velaikkara Forces of the <br />  Cholas <br />      that remained back in Sri Lanka to take charge of protecting <br />  this <br />      temple. </p>
<p>      All divisions of the Velaikkara forces, along with the <br />  Valanjiar, <br />      Nagaraththar and others took charge of this temple which was <br />  named <br />      as "Muntrukai Velaikkara Daladayaperumpalli", and jointly <br />    undertook <br />      the management and protection of this temple and all villages <br />    given <br />      to it as endowment. This they confirmed in Tamil on a stone <br />slab <br />      planted in the Polonnaruwa district and also on copper plates. </p>
<p>      (68) Jayabahu succeeds Vijayabahu on Sinhala throne </p>
<p>      In the same year of A.D.1114 Vijayabahu died, and was <br />succeeded <br />  by <br />      his brother Jayabahu as against the traditions of succession <br />on <br />    Sri <br />      Lankan throne preventing Vikkramabahu - 2 the son of <br />Vijayabahu <br />    from <br />      becoming the king. </p>
<p>      (69) Kulothunga gives his daughter in marraige to the Sri <br />Lankan <br />      Prince </p>
<p>      Kulothunga with a view to strengthening the relations with Sri <br />    Lanka <br />      after the death of Vijayabahu, gave away one of his daughters <br />    namely <br />      Suthamallialvar in marriage to the prince Manabarna alias <br />      Viraperumal alias Virabahu the son of Mitta (the Vijayabahu's <br />      sister) by a Pandian Prince. </p>
<p>      (70) Kulothunga appoints his heir apparent </p>
<p>      Kulothunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1115 appointed his son Vikkrama <br />  Chola <br />      (A.D.1118-1135) as his heir apparent to the Chola Throne who <br />      assisted him in the administration of the Chola empire. </p>
<p>      (71) Vikkramabahu's Officer provides Endowments to temple in <br />  India </p>
<p>      During this period Uiyavandhan Thiruvannamalaiyan alias <br />  Vijayabahu <br />      Masathunayan the chief officer of Vikkramabahu with the <br />  normalised <br />      relations of Cholas with Sri Lanka after the death of <br />  Vijayabahu, <br />      built a holy Pilgrims Rest named as Maheswaren Madam at <br />    Kondakarudu <br />      Dakkarama on the banks of Godavari river in the Andhra Pradesh <br />  in <br />      India, situated near the temple of Narenthira Iswarem Udaiya <br />      Mahadevar. </p>
<p>      Later in the year A.D.1120 he gave black and brass utensils to <br />      Bhimeshwarem Udaya Mahadevar at Periya Dakkarambi in the <br />      Guddhavadinadu a subdivision of Gangaikonda Cholavalanadu on <br />the <br />      occasion of the solar eclipse. </p>
<p>      (72) Kulothunga's daughter gives endowments to Siva temple in <br />  Sri <br />      Lanka </p>
<p>      In the year A.D.1122 Suthamallialvar daughter of Kulothunga <br />  Chola <br />    of <br />      the Chola country and the wife of Virapperumal who was the son <br />  of <br />      Mitta (sister Vijayabahu) by a Pandyan king, made donations to <br />  the <br />      Siva temple known as Vikkrama Calamega Iswarem in Magala alias <br />      Vikkirama Calamegapura in the present Budumuttawa in <br />  Nikaweratiya <br />    in <br />      Sri Lanka. She donated ten kasu for maintaing the burning of a <br />    lamp, <br />      and a standing brass lamp to this temple. </p>
<p>      The Chola Relations with Sri Lanka goes still further up to <br />the <br />    last <br />      Chola king namely the Rajendra Chola - 3 (1246- 1279), which <br />  will <br />    be <br />      continued later.</p>

<p>  Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>  Nice posting.  <br />  But we are getting into heavy History discussion.<br />  Let us load the facts and discuss leisurely in phases.</p>
<p>  We may have to ascertain that :</p>
<p>  1 :: Vijayalaya conquored Sattan Pazhiyili - Mutharaya. This is <br />  because of Vijayalachozeeswaram inscription in Narathamalai, found <br />  near Pazhuyileeswaram, built by Sattan Pazhiyili Mutharayar. This <br />  is widely discussed discrepancy and refer our Archieves too.</p>
<p>  A couple of years back I have quoted Senthalai (near <br />  Thirukattuppalli - Nemam ) inscriptions and pointed out that <br />Kavaran <br />  Maaran and Co., were the Mutharayas of Vijayala period..who <br />occupied <br />  Thanjai and in effect there were Two Mutharayas sect, one from <br />  Thanjai and other from Narathamalai, who took sides with Chozhas <br />and <br />  Pandyas respectively suiting political winds, which is not <br />uncommon.</p>
<p>  Pls go through the archieves.  </p>
<p>  2. Kandadithar was NOT in 63 Nayanmars. Because nayarnmar <br />varalaru <br />  was based on Nambiandar Nambi's Thiruthondarthogai, which paved <br />way <br />  for Periyapuranam of Sekkizhar. Kandradithar's Thiruvisappa <br />figured <br />  in the 12th Thirumurai- which compilation was around that period.<br />  Nayanamars period : 7th to 9th Century. There are very interesting <br />  facts related to this. We will discuss leisurely what is NOT <br />  already found in the WEB.</p>
<p>  3. Vijayalaya BUILDS or OCCUPIES a Capital at Thanjai ?</p>
<p>  These queries will prove that we do not have properly recorded <br />  History. At the same, the DEDUCED History is also NOT MUCH LET <br />OUT.</p>
<p>  We are confronting with TWO VITAL issues now:</p>
<p>  1. Should we put Kachcha History (like what we have in the Web ) <br />and <br />  discuss each and every point.. OR</p>
<p>  2. Should we Wait for REFINED (TRUE) HISTORY alone. ?</p>
<p>  Who will Certify ?</p>
<p>  Therefore, in bits, we can look at Kachcha History data, open to <br />  various view points and where possible reach some understanding... <br />  and if not, let us have the pleasure of exchanging views ..</p>
<p>  My humble request, pls do post this in some File .. later on we <br />can <br />  incorporate our observations as Foot notes atleast.</p>
<p>  New members please feel free to participate..</p>

<p>    cholas and srilanka</p>
<p>    (1) The Re-Emergence of the Chola Kingdom </p>
<p>  Cholas <br />    gradually re-emerged as a powerful ruling dynasty of Tamilnadu, <br />    after a long spell of nearly six centuries both in political <br />    obscurity and as feudatory of the Kalabra, Pallava and Pandiya <br />    dynasties of South India. </p>
<p>    (2) Vijayalaya Chola reigns from his capital Palaiyarai in <br />  Tamilnadu </p>
<p>    In the line of these Cholas sprung king Vijayalaya Chola <br />(A.D.849-<br />    881) ruling a small central region of the present Tamilnadu <br />state <br />    with his capital at Palaiyarai, and as a feudatory of the <br />Pallava <br />    king Nandivarman - 3 (A.D.826-850). </p>
<p>    (3) Vijayalaya Chola builds his new capital at Thanjavur </p>
<p>    In the year A.D.852 Vijayalaya Chola waged war with the <br />  Muttaraiyar <br />    king Sattan Paliyilli (A.D.826-852) in the neighbouring east, <br />and <br />    captured his territory of Thanjavur. </p>
<p>    Vijayalaya Chola built his new capital at Thanjavur with all <br />    facilities of a city commencing with the construction of a <br />temple <br />  to <br />    the Goddess Kali named as Nisumbasudani. The Chola country of <br />this <br />    period covered the central and the eastern regions of the <br />present <br />    Tamilnadu state. </p>
<p>    (4) King of Sri Lanka awaits to avenge the invasion of his <br />country <br />    by Pandiya </p>
<p>    During this period the Sri Lankan king Sena-2 (A.D.851-885) was <br />    awaiting an opportune moment to avenge the devastation and <br />  disgrace <br />    caused to Sri Lanka by an earlier invasion of the Pandiya king <br />    Srimara Sri Vallaba (A.D.835-862) which took place during the <br />rule <br />    of Sena-1(A.D.831-851). </p>
<p>    (5) Rebellious son of Pandiya seeks help from Sri Lanka </p>
<p>    Towards this time a son of Srimara Sri Vallaba by one of his <br />other <br />    queens, named Maya Pandiya claimed rights to succession against <br />    Varaguna Pandiya-2 the legitimate heir to the throne by the <br />chief <br />    queen of Srimara Sri Vallaba. This son with dissension with his <br />    father over same resolved to take over the Pandiya kingdom to <br />    himself and went to Sri Lanka to seek the assistance of the king <br />    Sena-2. </p>
<p>    (6) Sri Lankan forces invades and captures the Pandiya country </p>
<p>    Taking opportunity of the prevailing conditions, the king of Sri <br />    Lanka the Sena-2 sent a large army under his general named <br />  Kutthaka, <br />    who crossed seas from the port of Mahatittha the present Mantota <br />  and <br />    invaded the Pandiya country in the year A.D.862, killed Srimara <br />  Sri <br />    Vallaba laid waste the region, and captured the capital city of <br />  the <br />    Pandiya the Madurai. However Varaguna Pandiya - 2 escaped <br />capture <br />    and went into hiding. </p>
<p>    (7) The Sri Lankan forces crown the rebellious son on the <br />Pandiya <br />    throne </p>
<p>    The Sri Lankan forces thereafter anointed as the king the <br />  rebellious <br />    son of Srimara Sri Vallaba the Maya Pandiya who seeked their <br />    assistance to gain the throne, and returned to Sri Lanka with <br />much <br />    of the earlier lost treasures of the Sinhala country. </p>
<p>    (8) Pallava king Nirupatunga assists Varaguna to regain throne </p>
<p>    Varaguna Pandiya-2 requested the assistance of the Pallava king <br />    Nirupatunga (A.D.850-882) to retrieve his throne. The Pallava <br />king <br />    along with Vijayalaya Chola and his allies invaded and defeated <br />  the <br />    rebellious son of Pandiya and drove away the remaining Sinhala <br />    forces and reinstated Varaguna Pandiya - 2 (A.D.862-880) on <br />throne <br />    at Madurai in the year A.D.862. </p>
<p>    (9) Athiththa Chola ascends the Chola throne </p>
<p>    Vijayalaya Chola appointed his son Athiththa Chola (A.D.871-907) <br />  as <br />    his co-regent in the year A.D.871. He succeeded on the Chola <br />  throne <br />    at Thanjavur in the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya <br />    Chola. </p>
<p>    (10) Athiththa Chola recovers the regions of the Chola country </p>
<p>    During his period in the year A.D.880 Varaguna Pandiya - 2 waged <br />  war <br />    with the Pallava king Nirupathunga successor to Nandivarman, <br />with <br />    whom he had friendly relations earlier. The Athitha Chola <br />assited <br />    the Pallavas against Pandiya in this war at Thiruppurambiam. The <br />    Pallavas won the battle and Athiththa Chola too was benefitted <br />by <br />    being able to recover the entire Chola country. In the year A.D. <br />  890 <br />    he invaded and captured the Thondainadu and put an end to the <br />    Pallava dynasty with Aparajitha (A.D.882-890) the son of <br />    Nirupathunga. </p>
<p>    (11) Paranthaha Chola captures the Pandiya kingdom </p>
<p>    Athiththa died while in Thondainadu, and was suceeded by his son <br />    king Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-954) at Thanjavur, who in the <br />year <br />    A.D.910 captured the Pandiya country the southern region of the <br />    present Tamil Nadu state. The Pandiya king Rajasimhan-3 (A.D.905-<br />    921) few years after his defeat, escaped from his hiding to Sri <br />    Lanka and requested the Sinhala king Kasyappa-5 (A.D.913-923) to <br />    assist him in regaining his kingdom. </p>
<p>    (12) Pandiya King's second battle with Paranthaha Chola </p>
<p>    In the year A.D.919 king Kasyappa sent a large Sinhala force <br />under <br />    his general Saka Senapathi to assist Rajasimhan to recapture his <br />    kingdom. However Paranthaha's forces along with the forces of <br />his <br />    ally the Kannada king Piruthivi-2, defeated the combined forces <br />of <br />    Pandiya and the Sinhala forces, in a deadly battle at Vellur. </p>
<p>    (13) Pandiya King escapes to Sri Lanka with Regalia </p>
<p>    However the Pandiya king Rajasimhan escaped capture by Cholas, <br />and <br />    went to Sri Lanka with his crown and the other royal insignia <br />and <br />    took shelter in the Sinhala kingdom. He seeked further <br />assistance <br />    from the new Sinhala king Dappula-4 (A.D.923-934) in regaining <br />his <br />    kingdom. He on not receiving favourable response from Dappula-4 <br />  due <br />    to heavy repraisels from his nobles against same, left back his <br />    crown and insignia with him, and took asylum in the Chera <br />country <br />    the present south Kerala state. </p>
<p>    (14) Paranthaha Chola wages war with Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>    Paranthaha Chola now requested the next successor to the Sri <br />Lanka <br />    throne the Udaya-3 (A.D.934-937) to return the Pandiya crown and <br />    insignia, and on the latter's refusal Paranthaha in the year <br />  A.D.944 <br />    crossed seas to Sri Lanka, and defeated the king Udaya-3 who <br />    retreated from his capital Anuradhapura to Rohana in south Sri <br />  Lanka <br />    with the Pandiyan treasure. </p>
<p>    (15) Paranthaha Chola fails in his mission </p>
<p>    Paranthaha finding difficult to penetrate into Rohana returned <br />to <br />    Chola country with much booty and treasures from Lanka, but <br />  failing <br />    in his mission to retrieve the Pandiyan crown and royal insignia <br />    from king Udaya-3. However Paranthaha with the defeat of the <br />  Sinhala <br />    king assumed the new title the Singhalanthahan. </p>
<p>    (16) Gandarathiththa Chola looses Pandiya Country </p>
<p>    Paranthaha-1 was suceeeded on the Chola throne at Thanjavur by <br />his <br />    second son Gandarathiththa Chola (A.D.950-957), who spent almost <br />  his <br />    entire period of rule in spiritualism as an ardent Saivite, and <br />    finally was counted as one of the 63 great Saiva Saints of <br />    TamilNadu. </p>
<p>    (17) Arinjaya's short rule of Chola kingdom </p>
<p>    He was followed by his younger brother Arinjaya Chola (A.D956-<br />957) <br />    at Thanjavur, who had very short rule. </p>
<p>    (18) Chola Forces goes to Sri Lanka to assist the Commander Sena </p>
<p>    He was followed by his son Sundera Chola (A.D.957-973) on the <br />  throne <br />    at Thanjavur. During this period the Sri Lankan commander with <br />  much <br />    animosity with his own king Sena-5 (A.D972-981) came to Chola <br />    country and seeked military assistance from Sundera Chola, who <br />  sent <br />    as much as 95,000 troops to Sri Lanka led by thr Chola General <br />    Paranthahan Siriya Velan in A.D.954. </p>
<p>    (19) Chola General Meets his death in the battle in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>    In this battle Sena-5 was defeated and escaped to Rohana, but <br />the <br />    Chola commander met his death which made the forces to return to <br />    their country. </p>
<p>    (20) Rule of Utthama Chola </p>
<p>    After the death of Sundera Chola in A.D.973 the lawful successor <br />    prince Rajaraja Chola gave way to his paternal uncle Utthama <br />Chola <br />    (A.D.973-985) who was craving for the Chola throne, on the <br />    understanding that the succession to the throne at Thanjavur to <br />be <br />    passed on to prince Rajaraja after the death of Utthama Chola. </p>
<p>    (21) Rajaraja-1 succeeds on the Chola throne </p>
<p>    Likewise in the the year A.D.985 Rajaraja - 1 came into power. <br />    During this period in Sri Lanka king Mahinda-V (A.D.981-1029) <br />  ruling <br />    from Anuradhapura in the wake of an internal rebellion by the <br />  Kerala <br />    mercineries of his troops retreated to Rohana in A.D.991, and <br />    continued to rule the southern half of the island. </p>
<p>    This left the northern half in turmoil with no king for nearly <br />    eleven years with various chieftains yeilding power from time to <br />    time over territories in this region and a state of anarchy <br />    prevailed. Rajaraja taking advantage of the situation crossed <br />seas <br />    and invaded Sri Lanka in his seventeenth year the A.D.1002.

But Kassayappa sent his <br />forces <br />    to futile his attempt where he was defeated, and prince Kitti <br />  became <br />    the ruler of Rohana with royal name Vijayabahu. </p>
<p>    He then made preparations to wage war with the Cholas in north <br />Sri <br />    Lanka, but Virarajendra ordered the Chola general <br />Jeyamurinadalvar <br />    stationed at Polonnaruwa to invade Kataragama. The Chola forces <br />    plundered Kataragama, but Vijayabahu escaped capture and the <br />Chola <br />    forces returned to Polonnaruwa. Vijayabahu again returned to <br />    Sippatthalaka with strong forces and gradually established <br />himself <br />    in Rohona. </p>
<p>    (56) Vijayabahu seeks military aid from Burma </p>
<p>    He made fresh preparations to attack the Cholas, and sent a few <br />    years prior to A.D.1067 envoys with rich presents to king <br />  Anuruddha <br />    (A.D.1044-1077) of Pagan who was also the overlord of <br />Rammanadesa <br />    both being in present Burma, requesting for military assistance <br />    against Cholas. </p>
<p>    King Anuruddha on the other hand with no intention to create any <br />    enmity with the powerful Cholas, and also to prevent any strain <br />in <br />    relations with Sri lanka, sent instead many ships with various <br />    valuable gifts to king Vijayabahu, who now changed his abode to <br />    Tambalagama. </p>
<p>    (57) Virarajendra sends fresh expedition to Sri Lanka </p>
<p>    During this period in north Sri Lanka many inhabitants grew <br />  hostile <br />    and paid no tributes to the Chola kingdom. Vijayabahu too <br />  continued <br />    with his attempts to oust Cholas from Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>    This made Virarajendra to send a fresh expedition to Sri Lanka <br />in <br />    the year A.D.1067 with many ships of large forces to the port of <br />    Mathottam in north Sri Lanka under the general <br />  Kurukulaththaraiyan. </p>
<p>    He successfully brought the Mummudi Chola mandalam the northern <br />  half <br />    of Sri Lanka under the Chola control. He then proceeded to <br />Rohana <br />    with his forces where two mighty warriors of Vijayabahu, <br />Ravideva <br />    and Cala joined the Chola forces and fought against him. </p>
<p>    In this battle the Chola general Kurukulatharaiyan, and another <br />    commander lost their lives. This made Chola forces more furious <br />in <br />    which Rohana again fell into the hands of the Cholas who took <br />    Vijayabahu's queen captive with many treasures while he escaped <br />to <br />    his hideout. Again the whole of Sri Lanka came under the Chola <br />  rule. </p>
<p>    (58) Virarajendra issues gold coin in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>    Virarajendra issued a gold coin so debased as to be hardly <br />    distinguishable from silver having the legend Sri Rajendrah in <br />    nagari letters and on the reverse the Chola tiger between two <br />  lamps <br />    all under a canopy. </p>
<p>    (59) Virarajendra Chola appoints his heir apparent </p>
<p>    In the year A.D.1067 Virarajendra named his son Adhirajendra <br />Chola <br />    as the heir apprarent to the Chola throne and a co-ruler of the <br />    empire. </p>
<p>    (60) Kulothunga Chola succeeds on the throne of the Chola Empire </p>
<p>    In the year A.D.1070 with the death of Viarajendra a rebellion <br />    sparked off in the Chola country in which Adhirajendra was <br />    assasinated and a state of anrachy prevailed in the kingdom. </p>
<p>    His untimely death with no heir apparent to succeed paved way <br />for <br />    prince Rajendra of Vengi Nadu, as the next legitimate successor <br />to <br />    the Chola throne through his maternal side in the year A.D.1071 <br />  with <br />    the royal title Kulothunga Chola. </p>
<p>    (61) Vijayabahu saves Sri Lanka from Chola imperialism </p>
<p>    During this period in Sri Lanka the king Vijayabahu who earlier <br />  hid <br />    in the south after his defeat at the hands of the Cholas, <br />  gradually <br />    establised himself at Mahanagahula in the present Ambalangoda in <br />    south Sri Lanka, and struggled valiantly to relieve the island <br />  from <br />    the long standing grip of Cholas. </p>
<p>    In the year A.D.1088 he sent two seperate armies with large <br />forces <br />    simultaneously to the north-central province of Sri Lanka <br />against <br />    the Chola forces. </p>
<p>    The first unit of his troops intially captured the Chola <br />  strongholds <br />    at the villages Muhunnuru, Badalatthagalla, Vapinagara, <br />  Buddhigama, <br />    Tilagulla, Mahagalla, all in the Dakkinadesa the present <br />  Kurunagala <br />    district and proceeded to Anuradhapura. Here too Chola forces <br />were <br />    defeated and the city of Anuradhapura was captured . These <br />troops <br />    further perssued and defeated the Chola forces upto the seaport <br />of <br />    Mathottam alias Mahathittha in Mannar district. </p>
<p>    The second unit of troops of Vijayabahu was directed to the <br />  eastern <br />    province avoiding the mountainous regions which defeated the <br />Chola <br />    forces at Chagama in the south-central region of Sri lanka. When <br />    they reached Pullathinagara the present Polonnnaruwa the Sinhala <br />    generals requested Vijayabahu to join them quickly with further <br />    fresh forces. </p>
<p>    Vijayabahu highly taken up by the heroic deeds of his forces <br />    proceeded to Polonnaruwa with his valiant army from his town <br />    Mahanugala. After the brief stay on the way in the close <br />vicinity <br />  of <br />    Mahiyangana Buddhist temple they reached Polonnaruwa along east <br />    coast. </p>
<p>    The Chola forces stationed at various places in the close <br />vicinity <br />    all gathered immediately at Polonnaruwa and had a great battle <br />  with <br />    Sinhala forces. Vijayabahu's two great warriors Ravideva and <br />Cala <br />    who joined the Chola forces earlier against him, now re-joined <br />    Vijayabahu and fought with determination to exterminate the <br />  Cholas, <br />    and ending up with the victory to Sinhala forces. </p>
<p>    Vijayabahu to commemorate his victory over Cholas in Sri Lanka, <br />    assumed the title "Satru Rajachola Kula-anthaha'. </p>
<p>    (62) Vijayabahu marries the Kanyakubja Pricess </p>
<p>    During this period the wife and the daughter of the north Indian <br />    king Jegathipala who were taken prisoners to Chola country after <br />    defeat at the hands of Rajadhiraja-1 earlier at Rohana, escaped <br />  from <br />    Chola country and came back to Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>    They met the king Vijayabahu who later married the daughter <br />    Leelawathie and took her as his first consort. </p>
<p>    (63) KulothungaChola attempts peace with Sri Lanka </p>
<p>    Kulothunga Chola on the reverse after a long weary expedition in <br />  the <br />    far east seems to have decided to carry the balance regnal years <br />  in <br />    peace and refrained from reacting further. </p>
<p>    In confirming his friendly relations he sought the hands of the <br />  king <br />    Vijayabahu's sister Mitta, but Vijayabahu with much animosity <br />    against Cholas preferred the Pandiya prince in marriage to his <br />    sister who were long time allies of the Sri Lankan kings. </p>
<p>    (64) The beginning of the disintegration o the Chola empire </p>
<p>    The loss of Sri Lanka from the fold of the Cholas marked the <br />    beginning of the gradual disintegration of the Chola overseas <br />  empire <br />    from its healm during the rule of Virarajendra. </p>
<p>    (65) King Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka plans war with Chola country </p>
<p>    Kulothunga to strengthen the good relations with Sri Lanka sent <br />    envoys with rich presents to king Vijayabahu. during this same <br />    period the Sinhala envoys who were on their way to Karnataka <br />  kingdom <br />    in the Indian Mailand were humiliated in the Chola country by <br />some <br />    natives. </p>
<p>    Vijayabahu to avenge his anger over this incidence challenged <br />    Kulothunga for war through the same Chola envoys and gathered <br />his <br />    troops at the seaports of Mathottam and Mattikavatatittha in the <br />    present Mannar district in the year A.D.1089. </p>
<p>    The Velaikkara forces of Chola who choose to stay back in Sri <br />  Lanka <br />    and serve the Sinhala king after their defeat by Vijayabahu <br />  earlier <br />    now revolted against him on his plan to wage war with their <br />    motherland. </p>
<p>    In the revolt they caused destruction around Pulaththinagara the <br />    present Polonnaruwa and captured the king's sister Mitta with <br />her <br />    three sons. Vijayabahu escaped rebels and moved to south. </p>
<p>    However he returned back with his son Virabahu to Pulaththinagra <br />    defeated the rebels, released Mitta and her sons and established <br />    himself as the sole king of Sri lanka. </p>
<p>    (66) King Vijayabahu revives ambition to wage war with Cholas </p>
<p>    In the year A.D.1104 king Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka revived his <br />    ambition to fight the Cholas and awaited their forces at the <br />ports <br />    of Mannar in response to his challenge. However in the absense <br />of <br />    reaction from the Cholas he returned to his capital Polonnaruwa. </p>
<p>    (67) Velaikkara Forces undertake to protect the Buddhist temple </p>
<p>    King Vijayabahu in the year A.D.1114 ordered his official Deva <br />    Senavirattar to construct a Buddhist temple at Vijayarajapura. <br />He <br />  on <br />    completion of same instructed the Velaikkara Forces of the <br />Cholas <br />    that remained back in Sri Lanka to take charge of protecting <br />this <br />    temple. </p>
<p>    All divisions of the Velaikkara forces, along with the <br />Valanjiar, <br />    Nagaraththar and others took charge of this temple which was <br />named <br />    as "Muntrukai Velaikkara Daladayaperumpalli", and jointly <br />  undertook <br />    the management and protection of this temple and all villages <br />  given <br />    to it as endowment. This they confirmed in Tamil on a stone slab <br />    planted in the Polonnaruwa district and also on copper plates. </p>
<p>    (68) Jayabahu succeeds Vijayabahu on Sinhala throne </p>
<p>    In the same year of A.D.1114 Vijayabahu died, and was succeeded <br />by <br />    his brother Jayabahu as against the traditions of succession on <br />  Sri <br />    Lankan throne preventing Vikkramabahu - 2 the son of Vijayabahu <br />  from <br />    becoming the king. </p>
<p>    (69) Kulothunga gives his daughter in marraige to the Sri Lankan <br />    Prince </p>
<p>    Kulothunga with a view to strengthening the relations with Sri <br />  Lanka <br />    after the death of Vijayabahu, gave away one of his daughters <br />  namely <br />    Suthamallialvar in marriage to the prince Manabarna alias <br />    Viraperumal alias Virabahu the son of Mitta (the Vijayabahu's <br />    sister) by a Pandian Prince. </p>
<p>    (70) Kulothunga appoints his heir apparent </p>
<p>    Kulothunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1115 appointed his son Vikkrama <br />Chola <br />    (A.D.1118-1135) as his heir apparent to the Chola Throne who <br />    assisted him in the administration of the Chola empire. </p>
<p>    (71) Vikkramabahu's Officer provides Endowments to temple in <br />India </p>
<p>    During this period Uiyavandhan Thiruvannamalaiyan alias <br />Vijayabahu <br />    Masathunayan the chief officer of Vikkramabahu with the <br />normalised <br />    relations of Cholas with Sri Lanka after the death of <br />Vijayabahu, <br />    built a holy Pilgrims Rest named as Maheswaren Madam at <br />  Kondakarudu <br />    Dakkarama on the banks of Godavari river in the Andhra Pradesh <br />in <br />    India, situated near the temple of Narenthira Iswarem Udaiya <br />    Mahadevar. </p>
<p>    Later in the year A.D.1120 he gave black and brass utensils to <br />    Bhimeshwarem Udaya Mahadevar at Periya Dakkarambi in the <br />    Guddhavadinadu a subdivision of Gangaikonda Cholavalanadu on the <br />    occasion of the solar eclipse. </p>
<p>    (72) Kulothunga's daughter gives endowments to Siva temple in <br />Sri <br />    Lanka </p>
<p>    In the year A.D.1122 Suthamallialvar daughter of Kulothunga <br />Chola <br />  of <br />    the Chola country and the wife of Virapperumal who was the son <br />of <br />    Mitta (sister Vijayabahu) by a Pandyan king, made donations to <br />the <br />    Siva temple known as Vikkrama Calamega Iswarem in Magala alias <br />    Vikkirama Calamegapura in the present Budumuttawa in <br />Nikaweratiya <br />  in <br />    Sri Lanka. She donated ten kasu for maintaing the burning of a <br />  lamp, <br />    and a standing brass lamp to this temple. </p>
<p>    The Chola Relations with Sri Lanka goes still further up to the <br />  last <br />    Chola king namely the Rajendra Chola - 3 (1246- 1279), which <br />will <br />  be <br />    continued later.</p></vj_episteme@></p></blockquote>

<p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>Nice posting.  <br />But we are getting into heavy History discussion.<br />Let us load the facts and discuss leisurely in phases.</p>
<p>We may have to ascertain that :</p>
<p>1 :: Vijayalaya conquored Sattan Pazhiyili - Mutharaya. This is <br />because of Vijayalachozeeswaram inscription in Narathamalai, found <br />near Pazhuyileeswaram, built by Sattan Pazhiyili Mutharayar. This <br />is widely discussed discrepancy and refer our Archieves too.</p>
<p>A couple of years back I have quoted Senthalai (near <br />Thirukattuppalli - Nemam ) inscriptions and pointed out that Kavaran <br />Maaran and Co., were the Mutharayas of Vijayala period..who occupied <br />Thanjai and in effect there were Two Mutharayas sect, one from <br />Thanjai and other from Narathamalai, who took sides with Chozhas and <br />Pandyas respectively suiting political winds, which is not uncommon.</p>
<p>Pls go through the archieves.  </p>
<p>2. Kandadithar was NOT in 63 Nayanmars. Because nayarnmar varalaru <br />was based on Nambiandar Nambi's Thiruthondarthogai, which paved way <br />for Periyapuranam of Sekkizhar. Kandradithar's Thiruvisappa figured <br />in the 12th Thirumurai- which compilation was around that period.<br />Nayanamars period : 7th to 9th Century. There are very interesting <br />facts related to this. We will discuss leisurely what is NOT <br />already found in the WEB.</p>
<p>3. Vijayalaya BUILDS or OCCUPIES a Capital at Thanjai ?</p>
<p>These queries will prove that we do not have properly recorded <br />History. At the same, the DEDUCED History is also NOT MUCH LET OUT.</p>
<p>We are confronting with TWO VITAL issues now:</p>
<p>1. Should we put Kachcha History (like what we have in the Web ) and <br />discuss each and every point.. OR</p>
<p>2. Should we Wait for REFINED (TRUE) HISTORY alone. ?</p>
<p>Who will Certify ?</p>
<p>Therefore, in bits, we can look at Kachcha History data, open to <br />various view points and where possible reach some understanding... <br />and if not, let us have the pleasure of exchanging views ..</p>
<p>My humble request, pls do post this in some File .. later on we can <br />incorporate our observations as Foot notes atleast.</p>
<p>New members please feel free to participate..</p>

<blockquote><p>  cholas and srilanka</p>
<p>  (1) The Re-Emergence of the Chola Kingdom </p>
<p>Cholas <br />  gradually re-emerged as a powerful ruling dynasty of Tamilnadu, <br />  after a long spell of nearly six centuries both in political <br />  obscurity and as feudatory of the Kalabra, Pallava and Pandiya <br />  dynasties of South India. </p>
<p>  (2) Vijayalaya Chola reigns from his capital Palaiyarai in <br />Tamilnadu </p>
<p>  In the line of these Cholas sprung king Vijayalaya Chola (A.D.849-<br />  881) ruling a small central region of the present Tamilnadu state <br />  with his capital at Palaiyarai, and as a feudatory of the Pallava <br />  king Nandivarman - 3 (A.D.826-850). </p>
<p>  (3) Vijayalaya Chola builds his new capital at Thanjavur </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.852 Vijayalaya Chola waged war with the <br />Muttaraiyar <br />  king Sattan Paliyilli (A.D.826-852) in the neighbouring east, and <br />  captured his territory of Thanjavur. </p>
<p>  Vijayalaya Chola built his new capital at Thanjavur with all <br />  facilities of a city commencing with the construction of a temple <br />to <br />  the Goddess Kali named as Nisumbasudani. The Chola country of this <br />  period covered the central and the eastern regions of the present <br />  Tamilnadu state. </p>
<p>  (4) King of Sri Lanka awaits to avenge the invasion of his country <br />  by Pandiya </p>
<p>  During this period the Sri Lankan king Sena-2 (A.D.851-885) was <br />  awaiting an opportune moment to avenge the devastation and <br />disgrace <br />  caused to Sri Lanka by an earlier invasion of the Pandiya king <br />  Srimara Sri Vallaba (A.D.835-862) which took place during the rule <br />  of Sena-1(A.D.831-851). </p>
<p>  (5) Rebellious son of Pandiya seeks help from Sri Lanka </p>
<p>  Towards this time a son of Srimara Sri Vallaba by one of his other <br />  queens, named Maya Pandiya claimed rights to succession against <br />  Varaguna Pandiya-2 the legitimate heir to the throne by the chief <br />  queen of Srimara Sri Vallaba. This son with dissension with his <br />  father over same resolved to take over the Pandiya kingdom to <br />  himself and went to Sri Lanka to seek the assistance of the king <br />  Sena-2. </p>
<p>  (6) Sri Lankan forces invades and captures the Pandiya country </p>
<p>  Taking opportunity of the prevailing conditions, the king of Sri <br />  Lanka the Sena-2 sent a large army under his general named <br />Kutthaka, <br />  who crossed seas from the port of Mahatittha the present Mantota <br />and <br />  invaded the Pandiya country in the year A.D.862, killed Srimara <br />Sri <br />  Vallaba laid waste the region, and captured the capital city of <br />the <br />  Pandiya the Madurai. However Varaguna Pandiya - 2 escaped capture <br />  and went into hiding. </p>
<p>  (7) The Sri Lankan forces crown the rebellious son on the Pandiya <br />  throne </p>
<p>  The Sri Lankan forces thereafter anointed as the king the <br />rebellious <br />  son of Srimara Sri Vallaba the Maya Pandiya who seeked their <br />  assistance to gain the throne, and returned to Sri Lanka with much <br />  of the earlier lost treasures of the Sinhala country. </p>
<p>  (8) Pallava king Nirupatunga assists Varaguna to regain throne </p>
<p>  Varaguna Pandiya-2 requested the assistance of the Pallava king <br />  Nirupatunga (A.D.850-882) to retrieve his throne. The Pallava king <br />  along with Vijayalaya Chola and his allies invaded and defeated <br />the <br />  rebellious son of Pandiya and drove away the remaining Sinhala <br />  forces and reinstated Varaguna Pandiya - 2 (A.D.862-880) on throne <br />  at Madurai in the year A.D.862. </p>
<p>  (9) Athiththa Chola ascends the Chola throne </p>
<p>  Vijayalaya Chola appointed his son Athiththa Chola (A.D.871-907) <br />as <br />  his co-regent in the year A.D.871. He succeeded on the Chola <br />throne <br />  at Thanjavur in the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya <br />  Chola. </p>
<p>  (10) Athiththa Chola recovers the regions of the Chola country </p>
<p>  During his period in the year A.D.880 Varaguna Pandiya - 2 waged <br />war <br />  with the Pallava king Nirupathunga successor to Nandivarman, with <br />  whom he had friendly relations earlier. The Athitha Chola assited <br />  the Pallavas against Pandiya in this war at Thiruppurambiam. The <br />  Pallavas won the battle and Athiththa Chola too was benefitted by <br />  being able to recover the entire Chola country. In the year A.D. <br />890 <br />  he invaded and captured the Thondainadu and put an end to the <br />  Pallava dynasty with Aparajitha (A.D.882-890) the son of <br />  Nirupathunga. </p>
<p>  (11) Paranthaha Chola captures the Pandiya kingdom </p>
<p>  Athiththa died while in Thondainadu, and was suceeded by his son <br />  king Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-954) at Thanjavur, who in the year <br />  A.D.910 captured the Pandiya country the southern region of the <br />  present Tamil Nadu state.

<p>  In the year A.D.1063 with the death of Rajendra Chola - 2, <br />  Virarajendra Chola ascended the throne as the next successor to <br />the <br />  Chola empire. </p>
<p>  (55) Vijayabahu establishes himself at Rohana in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>  During this period in Sri Lanka a local Kesadhatu chief named <br />  Kassapa set up his rule at Rohana with his seat at Kataragama. <br />  (Kathirkamam). </p>
<p>  The Chola general stationed at Polonnaruwa not withstanding this <br />  sent an army to Kattaragama against Kasspa in which the Chola <br />forces <br />  were defeated and retreated to the north. Kassapa now set up his <br />  northern frontier at Rakkhapasana the present Rakwana and returd <br />to <br />  Kattaragama. </p>
<p>  At this time the prince named Kitti the nephew of Vikkramabahu <br />with <br />  his seat at Sippathalaka also in Rohana was taking efforts to <br />  establish himself in this province. But Kassayappa sent his forces <br />  to futile his attempt where he was defeated, and prince Kitti <br />became <br />  the ruler of Rohana with royal name Vijayabahu. </p>
<p>  He then made preparations to wage war with the Cholas in north Sri <br />  Lanka, but Virarajendra ordered the Chola general Jeyamurinadalvar <br />  stationed at Polonnaruwa to invade Kataragama. The Chola forces <br />  plundered Kataragama, but Vijayabahu escaped capture and the Chola <br />  forces returned to Polonnaruwa. Vijayabahu again returned to <br />  Sippatthalaka with strong forces and gradually established himself <br />  in Rohona. </p>
<p>  (56) Vijayabahu seeks military aid from Burma </p>
<p>  He made fresh preparations to attack the Cholas, and sent a few <br />  years prior to A.D.1067 envoys with rich presents to king <br />Anuruddha <br />  (A.D.1044-1077) of Pagan who was also the overlord of Rammanadesa <br />  both being in present Burma, requesting for military assistance <br />  against Cholas. </p>
<p>  King Anuruddha on the other hand with no intention to create any <br />  enmity with the powerful Cholas, and also to prevent any strain in <br />  relations with Sri lanka, sent instead many ships with various <br />  valuable gifts to king Vijayabahu, who now changed his abode to <br />  Tambalagama. </p>
<p>  (57) Virarajendra sends fresh expedition to Sri Lanka </p>
<p>  During this period in north Sri Lanka many inhabitants grew <br />hostile <br />  and paid no tributes to the Chola kingdom. Vijayabahu too <br />continued <br />  with his attempts to oust Cholas from Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>  This made Virarajendra to send a fresh expedition to Sri Lanka in <br />  the year A.D.1067 with many ships of large forces to the port of <br />  Mathottam in north Sri Lanka under the general <br />Kurukulaththaraiyan. </p>
<p>  He successfully brought the Mummudi Chola mandalam the northern <br />half <br />  of Sri Lanka under the Chola control. He then proceeded to Rohana <br />  with his forces where two mighty warriors of Vijayabahu, Ravideva <br />  and Cala joined the Chola forces and fought against him. </p>
<p>  In this battle the Chola general Kurukulatharaiyan, and another <br />  commander lost their lives. This made Chola forces more furious in <br />  which Rohana again fell into the hands of the Cholas who took <br />  Vijayabahu's queen captive with many treasures while he escaped to <br />  his hideout. Again the whole of Sri Lanka came under the Chola <br />rule. </p>
<p>  (58) Virarajendra issues gold coin in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>  Virarajendra issued a gold coin so debased as to be hardly <br />  distinguishable from silver having the legend Sri Rajendrah in <br />  nagari letters and on the reverse the Chola tiger between two <br />lamps <br />  all under a canopy. </p>
<p>  (59) Virarajendra Chola appoints his heir apparent </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1067 Virarajendra named his son Adhirajendra Chola <br />  as the heir apprarent to the Chola throne and a co-ruler of the <br />  empire. </p>
<p>  (60) Kulothunga Chola succeeds on the throne of the Chola Empire </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1070 with the death of Viarajendra a rebellion <br />  sparked off in the Chola country in which Adhirajendra was <br />  assasinated and a state of anrachy prevailed in the kingdom. </p>
<p>  His untimely death with no heir apparent to succeed paved way for <br />  prince Rajendra of Vengi Nadu, as the next legitimate successor to <br />  the Chola throne through his maternal side in the year A.D.1071 <br />with <br />  the royal title Kulothunga Chola. </p>
<p>  (61) Vijayabahu saves Sri Lanka from Chola imperialism </p>
<p>  During this period in Sri Lanka the king Vijayabahu who earlier <br />hid <br />  in the south after his defeat at the hands of the Cholas, <br />gradually <br />  establised himself at Mahanagahula in the present Ambalangoda in <br />  south Sri Lanka, and struggled valiantly to relieve the island <br />from <br />  the long standing grip of Cholas. </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1088 he sent two seperate armies with large forces <br />  simultaneously to the north-central province of Sri Lanka against <br />  the Chola forces. </p>
<p>  The first unit of his troops intially captured the Chola <br />strongholds <br />  at the villages Muhunnuru, Badalatthagalla, Vapinagara, <br />Buddhigama, <br />  Tilagulla, Mahagalla, all in the Dakkinadesa the present <br />Kurunagala <br />  district and proceeded to Anuradhapura. Here too Chola forces were <br />  defeated and the city of Anuradhapura was captured . These troops <br />  further perssued and defeated the Chola forces upto the seaport of <br />  Mathottam alias Mahathittha in Mannar district. </p>
<p>  The second unit of troops of Vijayabahu was directed to the <br />eastern <br />  province avoiding the mountainous regions which defeated the Chola <br />  forces at Chagama in the south-central region of Sri lanka. When <br />  they reached Pullathinagara the present Polonnnaruwa the Sinhala <br />  generals requested Vijayabahu to join them quickly with further <br />  fresh forces. </p>
<p>  Vijayabahu highly taken up by the heroic deeds of his forces <br />  proceeded to Polonnaruwa with his valiant army from his town <br />  Mahanugala. After the brief stay on the way in the close vicinity <br />of <br />  Mahiyangana Buddhist temple they reached Polonnaruwa along east <br />  coast. </p>
<p>  The Chola forces stationed at various places in the close vicinity <br />  all gathered immediately at Polonnaruwa and had a great battle <br />with <br />  Sinhala forces. Vijayabahu's two great warriors Ravideva and Cala <br />  who joined the Chola forces earlier against him, now re-joined <br />  Vijayabahu and fought with determination to exterminate the <br />Cholas, <br />  and ending up with the victory to Sinhala forces. </p>
<p>  Vijayabahu to commemorate his victory over Cholas in Sri Lanka, <br />  assumed the title "Satru Rajachola Kula-anthaha'. </p>
<p>  (62) Vijayabahu marries the Kanyakubja Pricess </p>
<p>  During this period the wife and the daughter of the north Indian <br />  king Jegathipala who were taken prisoners to Chola country after <br />  defeat at the hands of Rajadhiraja-1 earlier at Rohana, escaped <br />from <br />  Chola country and came back to Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>  They met the king Vijayabahu who later married the daughter <br />  Leelawathie and took her as his first consort. </p>
<p>  (63) KulothungaChola attempts peace with Sri Lanka </p>
<p>  Kulothunga Chola on the reverse after a long weary expedition in <br />the <br />  far east seems to have decided to carry the balance regnal years <br />in <br />  peace and refrained from reacting further. </p>
<p>  In confirming his friendly relations he sought the hands of the <br />king <br />  Vijayabahu's sister Mitta, but Vijayabahu with much animosity <br />  against Cholas preferred the Pandiya prince in marriage to his <br />  sister who were long time allies of the Sri Lankan kings. </p>
<p>  (64) The beginning of the disintegration o the Chola empire </p>
<p>  The loss of Sri Lanka from the fold of the Cholas marked the <br />  beginning of the gradual disintegration of the Chola overseas <br />empire <br />  from its healm during the rule of Virarajendra. </p>
<p>  (65) King Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka plans war with Chola country </p>
<p>  Kulothunga to strengthen the good relations with Sri Lanka sent <br />  envoys with rich presents to king Vijayabahu. during this same <br />  period the Sinhala envoys who were on their way to Karnataka <br />kingdom <br />  in the Indian Mailand were humiliated in the Chola country by some <br />  natives. </p>
<p>  Vijayabahu to avenge his anger over this incidence challenged <br />  Kulothunga for war through the same Chola envoys and gathered his <br />  troops at the seaports of Mathottam and Mattikavatatittha in the <br />  present Mannar district in the year A.D.1089. </p>
<p>  The Velaikkara forces of Chola who choose to stay back in Sri <br />Lanka <br />  and serve the Sinhala king after their defeat by Vijayabahu <br />earlier <br />  now revolted against him on his plan to wage war with their <br />  motherland. </p>
<p>  In the revolt they caused destruction around Pulaththinagara the <br />  present Polonnaruwa and captured the king's sister Mitta with her <br />  three sons. Vijayabahu escaped rebels and moved to south. </p>
<p>  However he returned back with his son Virabahu to Pulaththinagra <br />  defeated the rebels, released Mitta and her sons and established <br />  himself as the sole king of Sri lanka. </p>
<p>  (66) King Vijayabahu revives ambition to wage war with Cholas </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1104 king Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka revived his <br />  ambition to fight the Cholas and awaited their forces at the ports <br />  of Mannar in response to his challenge. However in the absense of <br />  reaction from the Cholas he returned to his capital Polonnaruwa. </p>
<p>  (67) Velaikkara Forces undertake to protect the Buddhist temple </p>
<p>  King Vijayabahu in the year A.D.1114 ordered his official Deva <br />  Senavirattar to construct a Buddhist temple at Vijayarajapura. He <br />on <br />  completion of same instructed the Velaikkara Forces of the Cholas <br />  that remained back in Sri Lanka to take charge of protecting this <br />  temple. </p>
<p>  All divisions of the Velaikkara forces, along with the Valanjiar, <br />  Nagaraththar and others took charge of this temple which was named <br />  as "Muntrukai Velaikkara Daladayaperumpalli", and jointly <br />undertook <br />  the management and protection of this temple and all villages <br />given <br />  to it as endowment. This they confirmed in Tamil on a stone slab <br />  planted in the Polonnaruwa district and also on copper plates. </p>
<p>  (68) Jayabahu succeeds Vijayabahu on Sinhala throne </p>
<p>  In the same year of A.D.1114 Vijayabahu died, and was succeeded by <br />  his brother Jayabahu as against the traditions of succession on <br />Sri <br />  Lankan throne preventing Vikkramabahu - 2 the son of Vijayabahu <br />from <br />  becoming the king. </p>
<p>  (69) Kulothunga gives his daughter in marraige to the Sri Lankan <br />  Prince </p>
<p>  Kulothunga with a view to strengthening the relations with Sri <br />Lanka <br />  after the death of Vijayabahu, gave away one of his daughters <br />namely <br />  Suthamallialvar in marriage to the prince Manabarna alias <br />  Viraperumal alias Virabahu the son of Mitta (the Vijayabahu's <br />  sister) by a Pandian Prince. </p>
<p>  (70) Kulothunga appoints his heir apparent </p>
<p>  Kulothunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1115 appointed his son Vikkrama Chola <br />  (A.D.1118-1135) as his heir apparent to the Chola Throne who <br />  assisted him in the administration of the Chola empire. </p>
<p>  (71) Vikkramabahu's Officer provides Endowments to temple in India </p>
<p>  During this period Uiyavandhan Thiruvannamalaiyan alias Vijayabahu <br />  Masathunayan the chief officer of Vikkramabahu with the normalised <br />  relations of Cholas with Sri Lanka after the death of Vijayabahu, <br />  built a holy Pilgrims Rest named as Maheswaren Madam at <br />Kondakarudu <br />  Dakkarama on the banks of Godavari river in the Andhra Pradesh in <br />  India, situated near the temple of Narenthira Iswarem Udaiya <br />  Mahadevar. </p>
<p>  Later in the year A.D.1120 he gave black and brass utensils to <br />  Bhimeshwarem Udaya Mahadevar at Periya Dakkarambi in the <br />  Guddhavadinadu a subdivision of Gangaikonda Cholavalanadu on the <br />  occasion of the solar eclipse. </p>
<p>  (72) Kulothunga's daughter gives endowments to Siva temple in Sri <br />  Lanka </p>
<p>  In the year A.D.1122 Suthamallialvar daughter of Kulothunga Chola <br />of <br />  the Chola country and the wife of Virapperumal who was the son of <br />  Mitta (sister Vijayabahu) by a Pandyan king, made donations to the <br />  Siva temple known as Vikkrama Calamega Iswarem in Magala alias <br />  Vikkirama Calamegapura in the present Budumuttawa in Nikaweratiya <br />in <br />  Sri Lanka. She donated ten kasu for maintaing the burning of a <br />lamp, <br />  and a standing brass lamp to this temple. </p>
<p>  The Chola Relations with Sri Lanka goes still further up to the <br />last <br />  Chola king namely the Rajendra Chola - 3 (1246- 1279), which will <br />be <br />  continued later.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Cholas and sri vijaya</p>
<p>With the beginning of the tenth century the Cholas with their <br />capital in Thanjavur in Tamilnadu, emerged as a powerful ruling <br />dynasty after a long spell in partial obscurity in the political <br />scene of South India. </p>
<p>In the year A.D.985 king Rajaraja Chola-1(A.D.985-1014) ascended the <br />throne as the next successor of the Chola kingdom. He gradually <br />conquered the neighbouring and far lying territories within the <br />Indian continent forming a great Chola empire. </p>
<p>He laid a firm foundation to this empire by the wits of his <br />political ingenuity and well streamlined administrative system <br />backed by a powerful army and naval power which made it to grow <br />steadily into an overseas empire. </p>
<p>During this period in South-East Asia there existed the mighty Sri <br />Vijayan empire ruled by a royal dynasty named the Sailendras. This <br />kingdom of Sri Vijaya was located at the lower part of Sumatra in <br />Indonesia, with its capital in the present Palembang. </p>
<p>At the time of Rajaraja on the Chola throne, king Chulamanivarman<br />(A.D. 998-1008) was ruling the Sri Vijaya empire, which encompassed <br />the whole of Sumatra. </p>
<p>In the same period in Malaysia there existed the famed kingdom of <br />Kadaram covering the present Kedah and Perak states adjoining the <br />sea in the north-west coast of the peninsular Malaysia. </p>
<p>However during the period of Rajaraja Chola, the kingdom of Kadarem <br />too came under the sway of the Sri Vijaya empire of Sumatra, with <br />king Chulamanivarman being the overlord of this kingdom. </p>
<p>The trade of Tamilnadu with Sumatra and peninsular Malaysia <br />increased during the reign of Rajaraja Chola. Many Traders flocked <br />to these countries from the Chola country and found settlements and <br />establised units if their trading guilds. </p>
<p>The Traders from Kadarem and Sri Vijaya too crossed the seas to the <br />Chola country with their commodities of trade. The iron ore and the <br />teakwood from Kadarem being two of the commodities were known as <br />Kadaraththu Irumbu and Kidaravan in the Chola country. </p>
<p>The good trade relations thus established paved way for better <br />diplomatic understanding between these two countries. </p>
<p>The Traders from Kadarem mainly Buddhists by religion sought the <br />assistance of their overlord king Chulamanivarman of Sri Vijaya who <br />too was a Buddhist, to construct a Buddhist Vihare at Nagapattinam <br />in the Chola country. </p>
<p>The Nagapattinam was the seaport city of the Cholas and was well <br />known to the traders of South-East Asia and China, where traders <br />from eighteen different countries traded in their commodities. </p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola on the request of Chulamanivarman granted land at <br />Shythiriya Sihamani Valanadu at Nagapattinam to build a Buddhist <br />temple under the name of "Chulamanipanma Vihare". </p>
<p>In the year A.D.1006 a village called Aanaimangalam closer to this <br />site was surveyed and donated to upkeep this vihare from its <br />revenues which were exempted from taxes. </p>
<p>In the following years, in A.D.1008 Rajaraja Chola confirmed on <br />copper plates the earlier grants made by him to the "Chulamanipanma <br />Vihare" at Nagapattinam and exempted same from taxes. </p>
<p>While the vihare was still under construction king Chulamanivarman <br />of Sri Vijaya died in A.D.1008, and his successor the son <br />Maravijayotungavarman (A.D.1008-1020) completed the construction of <br />this temple, which was also known as the Rajrajaperumpalli. </p>
<p>In the year A.D.1014 Rararaja Chola died after twenty nine years of <br />rule and was succeeded by his son Rajendra Chola-1 (A.D.1012-1044) <br />on the throne of the Chola empire. </p>
<p>After the ascension of Rajendra Chola, king Maravijayotungavarman of <br />Sri Vijaya requested him to reconfirm the grants made earlier by his <br />father to the "Chulamanipanma Vihare" built at Nagapattinam. </p>
<p>This request was granted and Thuvavuran Annukan the agent of the <br />ruler of Kadarem arranged the record of the history relating to the <br />construction of the vihare, and the grant of the Anaimangalam <br />village by Rajaraja which was written on copper plates by one <br />Thillaiyali. </p>
<p>It is evident there has also been another Buddhist Temple built at <br />Nagapattinam at the request of Maravijayotungavarman during the rule <br />of Rajendra Chola-1. Whether that too was named after the king of <br />Sri Vijaya the Maravijayotungavarman is not known, but it has been <br />called as Rajendra Chola Perumpalli. </p>
<p>At Sri Vijaya with the demise of Maravijayotungavarman in A.D.1020 <br />his son Sangirama Vijayotungavarman (A.D.1020-1022)succeeded on the <br />throne. During his rule however the good relations that existed <br />between these two empires broke, probabely due to some sort of <br />interference or hinderence to the flourishing Chola trade which <br />would have sparked off the anger of the Cholas. </p>
<p>The strain in the Chola-Sri Vijaya relationship caused Rajendra -1 <br />to send a big naval expedition with a large fleet of ships to South-<br />East Asia in the year A.D.1022. </p>
<p>The Cholas defeated Sri Vijaya, Kadarem, and many other kingdoms in <br />the present Malaysia, and in Sumatra of Indonesia, and it appears <br />eventually the Cholas handed back the kingdoms to the respective <br />rulers on they accepting the authority and agreeing to pay tributes. </p>
<p>However over a period of time gradually the good relations between <br />the Chola country and Kadarem was re-established. During the rule of <br />Kulothunga Chola - 1 (A.D.1071-1120) the king of Kadarem through his <br />envoys Rajavidyadara Sri Samandan and Abimanothunga Samanthan in the <br />year A.D.1091 requested him to reconfirm on copper plates the <br />earlier grants made to the Buddhist temples Rajendra Chola <br />Perumpalli and Rajaraja Perumpalli alias Sailendra Chulamanivarma <br />Vihare built by his predecessors at Nagapattinam in Shythiriya <br />Shihamani Valanadu of the Chola country. </p>
<p>This request was granted by Kulothunga Chola, and in the year <br />A.D.1090 the officers Rajavallaba Pallavaraiyan and Rajendrasinga <br />Muvendavelan arranged confirmation of same on copper plates. </p>
<p>Towards this period the seaport city of Nagapattinam was renamed as <br />Cholakulavalli Pattinam after one of Kulothunga's consorts, and <br />Shythiriya Shihamani valanadu as Keyamanikka valanadu. </p>
<p>These temples no longer exist today. However among the Bronze Buddha <br />Statues excavated in this area by the Archaeological Department. two <br />of them have the following inscribed words on their pedestal <br />confirming the location of the Chulamanipanma Vihare and that they <br />were kept enshrined in them. </p>
<p>(1) "......Chola Perumpalli Alvaar......" (seated Buddha) <br />(2) "......Chola Perumpalli Nayakar....." (standing Buddha) </p>
<p>The exact version of the inscription found on the Item (2) above is <br />as follows. </p>
<p>"(This is) the alvar for a festival procession of the temple of <br />Akkasalai-perumpalli in Rajendra Chola-perumpalli. This alvar was <br />set by Nalan-gunakara-udaiyar of Chirutavur. </p>
<p>Let it be auspicious (This alvar called) Akkasalaikal-nayakar is for <br />all the Padinen-vishayam" </p>
<p>The source of the above Inscription: A Bronze Buddha Image of <br />Nagapattinam - by N.Karashima &amp; Y.Subbarayalu.</p>

        <p>cholas and kerala</p>
<p>(1) Introduction </p>
<p>During the period of the nineth and the tenth centuries, the Chera <br />country was ruled by three principal royal dynasties known as the <br />Ayes, Venads, and Kulasekaras from three distinctive regions of <br />Kerala (the Sanskritised version of Chera), and the kings of these <br />three dynasties and the other Chieftains ruling smaller regions of <br />the rest of Kerala, all were generally referred to as the Cheras or <br />Keralas by the people of Chola &amp; Pandiya countries of this period. </p>
<p>The Aye dynasty were ruling a region covering from the present <br />Nagerkoil of Tamil Nadu the southern end of the Aye kingdom, upwards <br />into Kerala to the present Anjuthengu in the north of the present <br />Thiruvananthapuram, and was known as Aye Nadu. Their capital was at <br />Vilignam a seaport city south of Thiruvananthapuram. The Aye Nadu <br />also included the Kanthalursalai - a military and Vedic studies <br />acadamy and an armoury centre of the Aye kings, and was located deep <br />south beyond the Vilignam along the sea coast closer to Nagerkoil <br />the southern end of the Aye kingdom. </p>
<p>The Venad dynasty were ruling a region beyond Anjuthengu covering a <br />region upto Kottayam, known formally as Venadu and also as Kollam <br />Desam with their capital at Kollam (proper), also a seaport city on <br />the west Kerala. </p>
<p>The Kulasekara dynasty were ruling a region of Kerala beyond <br />Kottayam further north upto and around the present region of <br />Kolikkodu (Calicut) and known as Kudamalai Nadu, with their capital <br />at Mahodayapuram (Kodungolur) a seaport city also known as Makothai, <br />and a second interior capital known as Uthakai in the Kongu country <br />of that period (the present Udhagamandalam region of the Tamil Nadu, <br />bordering the Kerala also known as Udhagai), which was under their <br />rule during this period. </p>
<p>Unlike the Aye and the Venad dynasty, the vast territory ruled by <br />Kulasekara dynasty covered many small regions called "Nadus" under <br />different names, which were ruled by the local Chieftans who <br />accepted the authority of the Kulasekara dynasty, and ruled their <br />respective regions as subordinates to them. </p>
<p>(2) The Chera kings from A.D.801 up to the advent of Vijayalaya <br />Chola </p>
<p>Towards the beginning of the nineth century{i.e. A.D.801} a powerful <br />Chera king known as Kulasekaran {A.D.801-820} was ruling in <br />Kudamalainadu of the Kerala country, covering the length of the <br />Kolli - Malai (hills) regions in central and north Kerala, from his <br />capital at Mahodayapuram. </p>
<p>He has claimed for himself the titles "Kolik-kon", "Kudal-<br />nayagan", "Kongar Kon" confirming his authority over Koliyur (the <br />Uraiyur of the Chola country), and Kudal (the Madurai of the Pandiya <br />country), and also over the Kongu country. It was probably during <br />this period the Uthahai became the second capital of the Kulasekara <br />dynasty with a member of the Kulasekara family appointed to rule <br />over this region. <br />Kulasekaran was an ardent devotee of - Sri Rama (regarded as an <br />incarnation of God Vishnu), and hence the Vaishnavites of this <br />period referred to him as "Kulasekara Perumal" in reverence. </p>
<p>He made pilgrimages to Thiruvarangam (Sri Rangam) in Cholanadu, and <br />Thiruvenkatam (Thiruppathi) in Thondainadu - among others, and has <br />composed a set of hyms - in Tamil in praise of God Vishnu named <br />as "Perumal Thirumoli", and in Sanskrit named as "Muhunda Mala". He <br />abdicated the Chera throne to lead a holy life and was venerated as <br />one of the twelve great Tamil Vaishnava Saints, known as the <br />Kulasekara Alvar. </p>
<p>The Chera king Kulasekaran had a son by the name Rajasekaran. With <br />the abdication of Kulasekara from Chera throne, his son Rajasekaran <br />{A.D.820-844} became the king of the Chera country. He was also <br />known by the name Cheraman Perumal and unlike his father was an <br />ardent devotee of God Siva. </p>
<p>Rajasekaran while ruling the Chera country from Mahodayapuram spent <br />most of his time in religious activities and in meditation at the <br />Siva Temple in Thiruvanjaikkalam at Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) in <br />the Kerala country. It was during this time one of the great Tamil <br />Saiva Saint of Tamil Nadu - the Sundaramurthi Nayanar made a <br />pilgrimage to the Thiruvarur Temple in the Chola country. The Chera <br />king Rajasekaran with utmost desire to meet this great Tamil Saiva <br />Saint, also went to Thiruvarur at this same time. </p>
<p>Here with the blessings of God Siva of Thiruvarur the Chera king <br />composed hyms in Tamil in his praise known as "Mummanikkovai". From <br />there he went along with the Tamil Saint Sundarmurthi Nayanar to the <br />Siva shrine at Vedaranniyam in the Chola country and other Siva <br />Shrines all over the Pandiya country. He composed further hyms in <br />Tamil in praise of God Siva known as "Ponvanna Anthathi" <br />and "Thirukkalyana Gnana Ulla" and became to be known and venerated <br />as Cheraman Perumal Nayanar. All the above hyms composed by him have <br />been included in the eleventh "Thirumurai" (Thirumurais are a <br />collection of the sacred hyms in Tamil, sung on God Siva by various <br />Tamil Saiva Saints of TamilNadu and few from the Kerala State). </p>
<p>Finally at the eager request of the Cheraman Perumal Nayanar the <br />Tamil Saiva Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar opted to visit the palace of <br />this Chera king at his capital city of Mahodaiyapuram in the Chera <br />country travelling through Kongunadu the present Udagamandalam <br />(Udagai) region of Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p>While being here in A.D.844 the Saint Sundaramurthi Nayanar died. <br />Unable to bear the grief of the death of this great Saint, the <br />Cheraman Perumal Nayanar too met his death soon thereafter in the <br />same year. </p>
<p>It was during the period of the Chera king Kulasekaran and partly <br />during the period of the Chera king Rajasekaran, the great Saiva <br />Saint of Chera (Kerala) country namely the Sankaracharya who founded <br />the Advaita doctrine lived in Kerala. </p>
<p>It also appears the Tamil Saiva Saint known as Venattu Adigal from <br />Venad in the Chera country, though not classified under the sixty-<br />three Tamil Saiva Saints of Tamil Nadu, the hyms composed by him <br />named "Thiruvisaippa" on God Siva of Chidambaram in Chola country, <br />has been included in the nineth "Thirumurai". It appears the Venattu <br />Adigal lived during a period after the Tamil Saiva Saint the <br />Sundaramurthi Nayanar. </p>
<p>The Chera king Rajasekara alias Cheraman Perumal Nayanar was <br />followed by his son the king Sthanu Ravi alias Ravi Varma <br />Kulasekaran (alias Ko-Kandan) {A.D.844 - 885}on the Chera throne at <br />Mahodayapuram. Sthanu Ravi too was a Saivite like his father. He had <br />a daughter by the name Kilanadigal who married king Vijayaragadeva <br />from another Chera royal family ruling a part of Kerala. </p>
<p>It was only towards this time - the mid nineth century A.D, the <br />Chola dynasty emerged more into limelight, after a long spell in <br />partial or total obscurity in the political scene of Tamil Nadu for <br />nearly six centuries. </p>
<p>Period of Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881} </p>
<p>The first among this line of medieval Cholas who came into <br />prominance was the king Vijayalaya Chola {A.D.848-881}, who ruled <br />the Chola country from Thanjavur. </p>
<p>It appears that the Chera kings of this period, had very friendly <br />relations with the Chola country. The Sthanu Ravi and his daughter <br />both being of Saivite faith, and with the prevailing good relations <br />that existed with the Chola country, had made their endowments to <br />the Siva temples in the Chola country </p>
<p>In the year A.D.849 during the rule of the Chera king Sthanu Ravi <br />also known as Ravi Varma Tribuvanachakravarti Kulasekaradeva, the <br />villagers of the Chalukkipparu has gifted a village named Satanur in <br />the Thondainadu to the temple of Siva named as Tiruayanisuramudaiya <br />Nayanar. </p>
<p>The Chera Queen Kilanadigal provided gold for a lamp at the temple <br />of Thiruvannamalai in Thondaimanadu (adjacent to Chola country) in <br />the year A.D..851. The Chera king (Ko)Kandan Ravi alias Sthanu Ravi <br />also gifted land for lighting lamp at the temple at Kuttalam in <br />Pandiyanadu in the year in the year A.D.870. </p>
<p>Period of Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} </p>
<p>In the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya Chola his son <br />Athiththa Chola {A.D.871-907} succeeded on the Chola throne, who was <br />a co-regent of Vijayalaya from A.D.871. During the period of his <br />rule the Athiththa Chola waged war on Kongunadu assisted by the <br />Chera king Sthanu Ravi, and captured it from the Pandiyan king. </p>
<p>A general named Vikki Annan the chieftan of Kodumbalur was greatly <br />instrumental in winning this war by the Cholas, and was rewarded <br />jointly by the Chola &amp; Chera kings with a crown, palace, elephants, <br />royal palanquin, drum and the given the title "Sembiyan Thamil <br />Verl". <br />Towards the middle of Athiththa Chola's rule the Chera king Sthani <br />Ravi died and was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara {A.D.885-917} on <br />the Chera throne. </p>
<p>During this time the Pandiya king Paranthaha Vira Narayanan (A.D.860-<br />905) married a Chera Princes named Vanavan Mathevi, and to them was <br />born the Pandiyan king named Rajasimhan-2 (A.D.900-920). </p>
<p>Period of Paranthaha Chola{A.D.907-953} </p>
<p>Athitha Chola was succeeded by his son Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-<br />953) on the Chola throne. He married Udaiya Pirattiyar Kokkilan <br />Adigal daughter of the Chera king Rama Varma of Kulasekara dynasty. <br />He also married the daughter of another Chera king Paluvettaraiyar <br />Kandan Amuthan named Arumoli Nangai ruling from west Paluvur of the <br />present Tirutchirappalli in Tamil Nadu bordering Kerala. He had a <br />further queen by the name Villavan Mathevi probably the daughter of <br />the Venad King of the Chera country, who refer themselves <br />as "Villavar'. </p>
<p>Paranthaha Chola-1 had an elder son by Kokilanadigal named <br />Rajathithya, a second son by the name Gandarathitha and a younger <br />son by Arulmoli Nangai named Arinjayan. </p>
<p>A native of Nandikkaraiputtur in Kerala Country named Velankumaran <br />was the general of the Chola Prince Rajathithya. However the Prince <br />Rajaditya died very young in a war in Thondainadu. </p>
<p>Paranthaha Chola with the intention of annexing the Pandiyanadu <br />waged war with Pandiya king Rajasimhan-2. In this war the Chera king <br />Rama Varma Kulasekara assisted Paranthaha. </p>
<p>Rajasimhan-2 was defeated and went to Sri Lanka, and with the <br />assistance of the king of Sri Lanka fought back with Paranthaha and <br />his allies namely the Pallavas and the Chera king Ranma Varma at <br />Thirupurambiyam. But he was defeated and again took refuge in Sri <br />Lanka. </p>
<p>As Rajasimhan didnot receive further assistance from the Sri Lankan <br />king for a second expedition in regaining his throne, returned to <br />the Chera Country of his mother. </p>
<p>The matrimonial alliance of Paranthaha Chola with the foremost among <br />the royal families of Kerala country namely the Kulasekara dynasty, <br />paved way for the friendly relations that existed beteween these two <br />countries to increase many folds. During this period there seems to <br />have been an inflow of people from Chera country to the Chola <br />country, some of whom even worked for the Chola king. </p>
<p>The Kokkilan Adigal daughter of this Chera king (and the queen of <br />Paranthaha Chola) the has provided gold for expenses for lighting <br />lamps at the temple at Lalgudi in Cholanadu in the year A.D.923. </p>
<p>In this same year of A.D.923 Alala-Arisilar Kumaran a native of the <br />Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of (Kuda)Malainadu of Kerala country <br />gifted gold for lampstand at the temple Thirunallakuntram in <br />Kudumiyanmalai in Cholanadu. </p>
<p>In this same year another native also from Kodungolur of Malainadu <br />gifted gold for a lamp at the temple at Kudumiyanmalai in Cholanadu. </p>
<p>In the year A.D.926 queen Kokkilan Adigal has provided gold for <br />lighting lamps at the temple at Thiruvidaimaruthur in Thanjavur. </p>
<p>She also ordered the construction of a stone temple named <br />Thiruththondiswarem at Thirunavalur in Chola country. During her <br />time a tank has been constructed near Tribuwani (near present <br />Pondicherry) and named after her as Kokkilanadi-pereri in Chola <br />country. </p>
<p>There has been a native of the Chera country known as Kerala <br />Kurumban given a high office in the Chola kingdom by Paranthaha <br />Chola with the title Parakesari Mevenda Velar whose wife made gifts <br />to the the temple as Tiruvottriyur in the year A.D.927. </p>
<p>In the year A.D 936 Ravi Nili the daughter of Chera king <br />Vijayaragadevar (who was inturn the Son-in Law of earlier Chera king <br />Sthanu Ravi) provided thirty kalanju (a measure) of gold for <br />lighting lamp to the Mahadeva at the temple of Thiruvottriyur in <br />Thondainadu which was under Chola rule. </p>
<p>Another native of Kodungolur (Mahodayapuram) of Malainadu <br />(Kudamalainadu) in Kerala country in the year A.D.936 donated a lamp <br />to the temple at Thiruchanur in Thondaimandalam. </p>
<p>In the year A.D.943 the Kerala general Velankumaran of Prince <br />Rajathithya (eldest son of Paranthaha Chola) built a stone temple to <br />Arruttali Mahadeva at Mudiyur on the Pennar river in <br />Thondaimandalam. </p>
<p>Sheep for maintaing lamp was given to the temple at Thirumalpuram in <br />Thondainadu by Puvan Maran a native of Nediyatali of Kodungolur <br />(Mahodayapuram) in the Kerala country in the year A.D.948. </p>
<p>Another native of Kodungolur in Malainadu donated lands to the <br />presiding God Perumal at the Thiruvenkadu temple in Thanjavur <br />A.D.952 </p>
<p>Towards this time with the demise of the Chera king Rama Varma, the <br />king Kothai Ravi Varma {A.D.917-947} succeeded on the Chera throne <br />at Mahodayapuram the capital of Kudamalainadu in Kerala country. </p>
<p>After thirty years of rule Kothai Ravi Varma was followed by <br />Indukotha Varma {A.D. 944-962} on the Chera throne at Mahodayapuram. </p>
<p>Period of Gandarathitha Chola {A.D.950-957} </p>
<p>After Paranthaha-1, his second son of Gandarathithya Chola (A.D..950-<br />957) ascended the Chola throne after being a co-regent with <br />Paranthaha Chola from A.D.953. Though he was the Chola king his <br />thoughts were always around God Siva leading a more religious life, <br />and with his blessings have composed religious hyms in Tamil known <br />as "Thiruvisaippa" which have been included in the <br />nineth "Thirumurai". </p>
<p>Period of Arinjaya Chola {A.D.956-957} </p>
<p>He was followed by Arinjaya Chola (A.D.956-957) who succeeded to the <br />Chola throne. He too married the daughter of the Chera king the <br />Indukothai Ravi Varma named Athithan Kothai Piratiyar. </p>
<p>Period of Sundera Chola {A.D. 957-970} </p>
<p>With the premature death of Arinjaya Chola his son the Sundera Chola <br />ascended the Chola throne. He married the daughter of the king <br />Malaiyaman of Thirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Udaya Piratiyar <br />Thambiranadigal Vanavanmatheviyar alias Thiribhuvanamatheviyar, and <br />also the Paranthahan Theviammanar daughter of a Chera king , and to <br />the former was born the great Chola king RajaRaja-1. </p>
<p>During this period the Chera king Indukotha Varma was succeeded by <br />Bhaskara Ravi Varma - 1 {A.D.962-1019} at Mahodayapuram. Years later <br />Baskara Ravi Varma - 2 {A.D.979-1014} appears to have assisted <br />Bhakara Ravi Varma ? 1 in ruling his vast Chera empire which <br />stretched from the present Calicut to Tiruvanandapuram region <br />encompassing the Kudamalainadu, Kongunadu and Venad, as his co-<br />regent probably from Uthahai in the Kongu region which was under the <br />Chera rule during this period. </p>
<p>Period of Uthama Chola {A.D. 970-985} </p>
<p>After the demise of Sundera Chola his son Rajaraja ? 1 who was the <br />legitimate heir to the Chola throne, whole heartedly gave way to <br />Uthama Chola (A.D.970-985) the son of Gandarathitha Chola being his <br />paternal uncle, to rule for some period. </p>
<p>Uthama Chola had among others, a queen named Panchavanmatheviyar who <br />was the daughter of the Chera king Paluvettaraiyar also known as <br />Kandan Sundera Cholan. </p>
<p>Period of Rajaraja Chola ?1 {A.D.985-1014} </p>
<p>Uthama Chola died in the year A.D.985, and was succeeded by the heir <br />apparent Rajaraja Chola-1{A.D.985-1014} on the Chola throne. </p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola - 1 too married a daughter of the Malaiyaman king of <br />Tirukkovalur in Thondainadu named Vanavanmathevi, who was also known <br />as Thiribhuvanamadevi. One of his other queens was Villavanmathevi <br />the daughter of the king of Venadu of Chera country. He also had a <br />queen known as Panchavanmathevi who was the daughter of <br />Paluvettaraiyar Kandan Maravan the Chera king of Paluvur on the west <br />of Thirutchirappalli bordering Kerala state. It was to Vanavanmadevi <br />the greatest emperor of the Chola dynasty namely the Rajendra Chola ?<br />1 was born. </p>
<p>With the accession of Rajaraja Chola -1 on the Chola throne and with <br />his "imperialistic ambitions" over South India, found that it was <br />necessary initially to overcome the powerful Cheras. </p>
<p>The peaceful and friendly relations the Cholas has with the Cheras <br />from the earliest times through the period of Vijayalaya Chola <br />{A.D.848-881} upto the time of Uththama Chola{A.D. 970-985} thus <br />became strained, and led to nearly a hundred years of war among them <br />to retain their supremacy. </p>
<p>During the rule of the earlier Chola kings and Rajaraja Chola -1, <br />the Aye dynasty of the Chera country over period of time had built <br />up a military and vedic acadamy and an arsenal centre at Kandalur <br />Salai, which was located south of Thiruvananthapuram and produced <br />many great trained warriors. </p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola -1 realised the destruction of the supply lines to <br />these acadamy of trained warriors and the arsenal centre of the Aye <br />kings of Chera (Kerala) country, and to their Pandiyan ally namely <br />Amarabujangan was an absolute necessity initialy, in order to win <br />the southern region of the Chera and Pandiya countries ruled by <br />these two powerful kings. </p>
<p>Rajaraja-1 waged war on the Kandalursalai for th first time in <br />A.D.988, and it appears he only partly destroyed this military <br />acadamy. But it appears the Cheras reinstated their positions again <br />in Kandalursalai and continued with the functions of their military <br />acadamy and arsenal centre. </p>
<p>This made Rajaraja Chola-1 to wage war again on Kandalursali in the <br />year A.D.995, and effectively destroyed the Kandalursalai military <br />acadamy and arsenal centre, and defeated the ruling Aye king of <br />Kerala country and captured his capital the seaport city of <br />Vilignam. </p>
<p>The Aye Kingdom comprised of Nanchilnadu &amp; Valluvanadu. The Rajaraja <br />Chola after his capture of the Aye kingdom, re-named a village <br />called Muttam in Valluvanadu as Mummudicholanallur, a subdivision of <br />Aye Nadu which too was renamed as the Rajarja Tennadu. </p>
<p>He donated grants to a temple known as Tirunandikkarai in this <br />village of Muttam in the year A.D.1003, and ordered that in the <br />month of Iyppasi (October/November) a festival to be celebrated <br />ending on the day of Sadayam nakshaththiram (his birth star), on <br />which day the image of the God at the temple of Tirunandiikkarai was <br />to be bathed in the river and a perpetual lamp named Rajarajan to be <br />lit every day. </p>
<p>He now turned his attention on his conquest of the territories in <br />the Karnataka country, Kudamalainadu, and the Kongu region of the <br />present Tamilnadu. Chola king Rajaraja -1 thereafter sent an <br />ambassador to the co-regent of the king Baskara Ravi Varma-1 of <br />Mahodai ruling from Uthahai (present Udhagamandalam also known as <br />Udagai), namely Baskara Ravi Varma ?2 probably a member from the <br />family of Kulasekaras, requesting him to submit to Chola suzerainty <br />and to pay tributes. </p>
<p>The Chola ambassador was humilated by the Chera co-regent of Uthahai <br />and was put to prison at Uthahai, which enraged Rajaraja Chola-1 who <br />sent a large expedition to Uthahai probably in the year A.D.1014 <br />which was destroyed and the city was captured and it appears Baskara <br />Ravi Varma ? 2 met his death and Kongunadu which came under the <br />control of the Cholas. </p>
<p>The Chola forces further moved into the Kudamalainadu the north and <br />central regions of Kerala state and defeated Baskara Ravivarman <br />Thiruvadi (Baskara Ravi Varaman ? 1) the ruling king of the <br />Kulasekara dynasty, and captured his capital Mahadayapuram <br />(Kodungolur). It appears Baskara Ravi Varman -1 too accepted the <br />Chola suzerainty and continued to rule from Mahodayapuram in the <br />Kerala country paying tributes. This brought all the territories of <br />Chera country ruled by the other chieftans and which were under <br />Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 too to accept the Chola supremacy. </p>
<p>The Chola forces moved further into the Venad territory (Kolladesam) <br />and captured the the region along with its seaport capital the Kollam<br />(proper), which were at this time ruled by the chieftain Govardhana <br />Marttanda appointed by king Baskara Ravi Varman ? 1 of the <br />Mahodayapuram in Kudamalainadu. </p>
<p>Period of Rajendra Chola ? 1 {A.D.1012 ? 1044} </p>
<p>Rajaraja Chola ? 1 died in the year A.D.1014 and was succeeeded by <br />his son Rajendra Chola ? 1 on the chola throne after being a co-<br />regent with Rajaraja Chola from A.D1012. </p>
<p>During the period of Rajendra Chola ? 1, in the year A.D.1019 with <br />the agitation for freedom by the king Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 of <br />Kerala, he sent a war expedition under the leadership of his second <br />son Manukulakesari to Kudamalainadu in the Chera country who <br />defeated the Chera King Baskara Ravi Varma ? 1 captured his capital <br />Mahothai and secured his crown, diadem and an island called <br />Santhimathivu belonging to the Kerala king beyond Kerala in Arabic <br />sea. In this war Baskara Ravi Varman - 1 met his death. </p>
<p>With the secure of the Chera crown the Rajendra Chola ? 1 assumed <br />the new title as Mudikonda Cholan. Rajendra Chola ?1 gave the <br />title "Chola Keralan" to his second son Manukulakesari and appointed <br />him as the chola viceroy to rule the captured Kudamalai Nadu of the <br />Kerala country. </p>
<p>However with the necessaity of he having to lead a war expedition <br />with eastern Chalukiya king, he was recalled back from Chera country <br />in the year A.D.1021, while appointing the Chera king Veera Keralan<br />{A.D1021-1028} son of Baskara Ravi Varman to rule his country on <br />accepting the Chola suzerainty. </p>
<p>Manululakesari met his death at the Chola-Chalukya war, and his <br />father Rajendra Chola in his memory built a temple at Jayamaliswarem <br />in A.D.1023, and built a Salai for providing food named as Chola-<br />Keralan Salai, and for its revenue for expenses gifted a village <br />named Chola-Kerala Nallur. </p>
<p>Rajendra Chola ? 1 with the death of his mother years later, made a <br />statue of herself and installed at the temple known as <br />Sembianmathevi at Nagapattinam, and made arrangements for its <br />worship. In Sri Lanka too at Polonnaruwa Rajendra Chola built a Siva <br />temple by the name Vanavanmathevi Iswarem in her memory. </p>
<p>Rajendra Chola ?1 had a queen named as Panchavanmathevi daughter of <br />the Chera king Paluvettariyar and another by the name Vananvanmadevi <br />daughter of the king Malaiyaman of Kovalur. </p>
<p>Rajendra Chola built a new imperial capital named as <br />Gangaikondasolapuram west of present Chidambaram and there he built <br />his new royal palace and named it as "Keralan Maligai" commemorating <br />his victory over Kerala kings. </p>
<p>Period of Rajadiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} </p>
<p>With the death of Rajendra Chola ? 1 in A.D.1044 his eldest son the <br />Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 {A.D.1018-1054} who had been a co-regent of <br />Rajendra Chola since A.D.1018 succeeded on the Chola throne. When he <br />ascended the throne among the countries that were still under the <br />Chola control, was the Mahodayapuram of the Kerala country. </p>
<p>During this period the Chera kings of the Kulasekara dynasty at <br />Mahodai and of Venadu, were agitating to get their freedom. <br />Rajadhiraja ? 1 to contain these agitations sent forces which first <br />proceeded to Mahodayapuram and defeated the Chera king Veera Keralan <br />in A.D.1028, who was put to death by his elephant Atthivaranam. </p>
<p>He appointed Rajasimhan {1028-1043} the son of Vira Kerala as the <br />Chera King on he having accepted the Chola suzerainty, who continued <br />to rule from Mahodai paying tributes to Cholas, and had friendly <br />relations with them for some time. </p>
<p>This fact is surmised from the fact that the Gopalaswami Temple at <br />Mannar Kovil in Tirunelveli was built by the Chera king Rajasimhan, <br />but was named by him as Rajendra Chola Vinnagar. Rajendra Chola too <br />has made a grant of land to this temple in A.D.1042. </p>
<p>Further in the 14th year of the Sundera Chola Pandiya devar at <br />Mannar Koyil in Tinnelveli the Seralan Madeviyar Adicchi queen of <br />the Chera king Rajasimhadevar made some donations to this Rajendra <br />Chola Vinnagar Alvar. </p>
<p>Again in Venad the new king of Govardhana Marthanda started <br />agitating for freedom assisted by the chieftain known as Ramakuda <br />Muvar of the region Koovaham also of Kerala. Rajadiraja sent an <br />expedition to Venad where it's king was defeated and escaped from <br />his kingdom to the jungles along with the king of Koovakam, and <br />Rajadhiraja's forces further destroyed the military acadamy and arms <br />centre that became active again at Kanthalur Salai, and attacked and <br />defeated Vilignam which revived its efforts under Aye kings to <br />become independent, and was renamed as Rajendra Cholapattinam. </p>
<p>However it appears the king of Venad continued to rule accepting the <br />suzerainty of the Cholas, and agreeing to pay tributes. Rajasimha <br />was followed by Bhaskara Ravi ? 3 {A.D.1043-1082}on the Chera <br />throne. </p>
<p>Period of Rajendra ? 2 {A.D.1051-1063} </p>
<p>In the year A.D.1054 Rajadiraja Chola ?1 died in the battle field at <br />Koppam. Immediately his younger brother Rajendra Chola ? 2{A.D.1051-<br />1063} who was the co-regent with Rajadhiraja Chola ? 1 from <br />A.D.1051, crowned as the next Chola in the battle field itself and <br />continued with the war with success to Cholas. </p>
<p>During this period one of his sons was given the title Chola Keralan <br />in memory of his elder brother Manukulakesari who bore the same <br />title as Chola Keralan. </p>
<p>Period of Virarajendra {A.D.1063-1070} </p>
<p>With the demise of Rajendra ?2, Virarajendra Chola{A.D.1063-1070} <br />was crowned as the next king of the Chola empire. On he ascending <br />the Chola throne, again the Cheras at Venad and Mahodayaouram <br />started agiatating to free themselves from the Chola fold. <br />Virarajendra first sent an expedition to Venad and killed the <br />younger brother of the Kerala king named Jananathan, while the king <br />himself escaped from his country. </p>
<p>Later with the agitation also from the Chera king Bhaskara Ravi ? 2, <br />it necessiated Virarajendra Chola to go on a renewed war expedition <br />to the great cities of the Chera country namely the Uthahai and <br />Mahodai with big elephant cavalry to suppress the agitation. The <br />Chera king in fear escaped with his family to safety. He defeating <br />the Chera country returned back with much tributes, elephants and <br />maids. </p>
<p>Period of Adhirajendra {A.D1070-1073} </p>
<p>With the death of Virarajendra his son Adirajendra{A.D1070-1074} <br />succeeded on the Chola throne in A.D.1070, after being his co-regent <br />from A.D1067. His period of rule ended within a short period of few <br />months due to illness. </p>
<p>During this period a Chera chieftain by the name Kerala Kesari <br />Athirajathirajadever who also bore the title "Virakeralan" ruling <br />from Kongunadu have made donations to the temple of Vishnu at <br />Thirukkannapuram in Thanjavur region for lighting of lamps. </p>
<p>Period of Kulothunga Chola {A.D1070-1120} </p>
<p>After the death of Adirajendra there has been a turmoil in the Chola <br />country with no direct male decendents in the line of the Rajaraja <br />Chola ? 1 to succeed. </p>
<p>Eventually the great-grandson of Rajaraja Chola ? 1, namely <br />Kulothunga Chola ? 1 {A.D.1074-1120} became the rightful heir to the <br />chola throne hailing from the female decendents of Rajaraja in the <br />year A.D.1074. </p>
<p>Taking opportunity of the turmoil in the Chola country the Chera <br />kings at Aynad, Venad and Kudamalainadu agitated to gain freedom <br />from from the Chola kings. </p>
<p>Kulothunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1081 waged war with the Cheras. He <br />captured Vilignam, Kanthalursalai including Kottaru north of Kumari <br />all of Ayenadu. The Chera king agreed to rule as a subordinate king <br />and pay tributes. At Kottaru in south Kerala country he stationd a <br />nilappadai (ground force) known as Kottaru Nillapadai under the <br />general Araiyan Mathuranthahan alias Chola Keralarasan. </p>
<p>Kulothunga Chola forces further moved to Mahodayapuram in <br />Kudamalainadu in the Kerala country and defeated the Chavar forces <br />(suicide sqads) of Baskara Ravi Varma ?3 who also met his death in <br />this war in A.D.1082. He was succeeded by Ravi Rama Varma {A.D.1082-<br />1090} on the throne with his acceptance to pay tribute to Cholas. </p>
<p>He was followed by Rama Varma Kulasekara {A.D.1090 ? 1102} at <br />Mahodayapuram throne. It appears some time after A.D.1090 Rama Varma <br />Kulasekara with his powerful Chavar forces defeated the Cholas and <br />regained full power in Kudamalainadu. It seems Kulothunga Chola ? 1 <br />didnot take any serious attempt to regain the lost territories of <br />the Kerala country. It appears this was the ending point of 100 <br />years of intermittant war between the Cholas and the Cheras. </p>
<p>The Tamil Temple Inscriptions however mentions a few more Chola-<br />Chera conflicts after Kulothunga ? 1 during the period of the <br />remaing Cholas upto A.D.1250 </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>cholas and srilanka</p>
<p>(1) The Re-Emergence of the Chola Kingdom </p>
<p>gradually re-emerged as a powerful ruling dynasty of Tamilnadu, <br />after a long spell of nearly six centuries both in political <br />obscurity and as feudatory of the Kalabra, Pallava and Pandiya <br />dynasties of South India. </p>
<p>(2) Vijayalaya Chola reigns from his capital Palaiyarai in Tamilnadu </p>
<p>In the line of these Cholas sprung king Vijayalaya Chola (A.D.849-<br />881) ruling a small central region of the present Tamilnadu state <br />with his capital at Palaiyarai, and as a feudatory of the Pallava <br />king Nandivarman - 3 (A.D.826-850). </p>
<p>(3) Vijayalaya Chola builds his new capital at Thanjavur </p>
<p>In the year A.D.852 Vijayalaya Chola waged war with the Muttaraiyar <br />king Sattan Paliyilli (A.D.826-852) in the neighbouring east, and <br />captured his territory of Thanjavur. </p>
<p>Vijayalaya Chola built his new capital at Thanjavur with all <br />facilities of a city commencing with the construction of a temple to <br />the Goddess Kali named as Nisumbasudani. The Chola country of this <br />period covered the central and the eastern regions of the present <br />Tamilnadu state. </p>
<p>(4) King of Sri Lanka awaits to avenge the invasion of his country <br />by Pandiya </p>
<p>During this period the Sri Lankan king Sena-2 (A.D.851-885) was <br />awaiting an opportune moment to avenge the devastation and disgrace <br />caused to Sri Lanka by an earlier invasion of the Pandiya king <br />Srimara Sri Vallaba (A.D.835-862) which took place during the rule <br />of Sena-1(A.D.831-851). </p>
<p>(5) Rebellious son of Pandiya seeks help from Sri Lanka </p>
<p>Towards this time a son of Srimara Sri Vallaba by one of his other <br />queens, named Maya Pandiya claimed rights to succession against <br />Varaguna Pandiya-2 the legitimate heir to the throne by the chief <br />queen of Srimara Sri Vallaba. This son with dissension with his <br />father over same resolved to take over the Pandiya kingdom to <br />himself and went to Sri Lanka to seek the assistance of the king <br />Sena-2. </p>
<p>(6) Sri Lankan forces invades and captures the Pandiya country </p>
<p>Taking opportunity of the prevailing conditions, the king of Sri <br />Lanka the Sena-2 sent a large army under his general named Kutthaka, <br />who crossed seas from the port of Mahatittha the present Mantota and <br />invaded the Pandiya country in the year A.D.862, killed Srimara Sri <br />Vallaba laid waste the region, and captured the capital city of the <br />Pandiya the Madurai. However Varaguna Pandiya - 2 escaped capture <br />and went into hiding. </p>
<p>(7) The Sri Lankan forces crown the rebellious son on the Pandiya <br />throne </p>
<p>The Sri Lankan forces thereafter anointed as the king the rebellious <br />son of Srimara Sri Vallaba the Maya Pandiya who seeked their <br />assistance to gain the throne, and returned to Sri Lanka with much <br />of the earlier lost treasures of the Sinhala country. </p>
<p>(8) Pallava king Nirupatunga assists Varaguna to regain throne </p>
<p>Varaguna Pandiya-2 requested the assistance of the Pallava king <br />Nirupatunga (A.D.850-882) to retrieve his throne. The Pallava king <br />along with Vijayalaya Chola and his allies invaded and defeated the <br />rebellious son of Pandiya and drove away the remaining Sinhala <br />forces and reinstated Varaguna Pandiya - 2 (A.D.862-880) on throne <br />at Madurai in the year A.D.862. </p>
<p>(9) Athiththa Chola ascends the Chola throne </p>
<p>Vijayalaya Chola appointed his son Athiththa Chola (A.D.871-907) as <br />his co-regent in the year A.D.871. He succeeded on the Chola throne <br />at Thanjavur in the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayalaya <br />Chola. </p>
<p>(10) Athiththa Chola recovers the regions of the Chola country </p>
<p>During his period in the year A.D.880 Varaguna Pandiya - 2 waged war <br />with the Pallava king Nirupathunga successor to Nandivarman, with <br />whom he had friendly relations earlier. The Athitha Chola assited <br />the Pallavas against Pandiya in this war at Thiruppurambiam. The <br />Pallavas won the battle and Athiththa Chola too was benefitted by <br />being able to recover the entire Chola country. In the year A.D. 890 <br />he invaded and captured the Thondainadu and put an end to the <br />Pallava dynasty with Aparajitha (A.D.882-890) the son of <br />Nirupathunga. </p>
<p>(11) Paranthaha Chola captures the Pandiya kingdom </p>
<p>Athiththa died while in Thondainadu, and was suceeded by his son <br />king Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-954) at Thanjavur, who in the year <br />A.D.910 captured the Pandiya country the southern region of the <br />present Tamil Nadu state. The Pandiya king Rajasimhan-3 (A.D.905-<br />921) few years after his defeat, escaped from his hiding to Sri <br />Lanka and requested the Sinhala king Kasyappa-5 (A.D.913-923) to <br />assist him in regaining his kingdom. </p>
<p>(12) Pandiya King's second battle with Paranthaha Chola </p>
<p>In the year A.D.919 king Kasyappa sent a large Sinhala force under <br />his general Saka Senapathi to assist Rajasimhan to recapture his <br />kingdom. However Paranthaha's forces along with the forces of his <br />ally the Kannada king Piruthivi-2, defeated the combined forces of <br />Pandiya and the Sinhala forces, in a deadly battle at Vellur. </p>
<p>(13) Pandiya King escapes to Sri Lanka with Regalia </p>
<p>However the Pandiya king Rajasimhan escaped capture by Cholas, and <br />went to Sri Lanka with his crown and the other royal insignia and <br />took shelter in the Sinhala kingdom. He seeked further assistance <br />from the new Sinhala king Dappula-4 (A.D.923-934) in regaining his <br />kingdom. He on not receiving favourable response from Dappula-4 due <br />to heavy repraisels from his nobles against same, left back his <br />crown and insignia with him, and took asylum in the Chera country <br />the present south Kerala state. </p>
<p>(14) Paranthaha Chola wages war with Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>Paranthaha Chola now requested the next successor to the Sri Lanka <br />throne the Udaya-3 (A.D.934-937) to return the Pandiya crown and <br />insignia, and on the latter's refusal Paranthaha in the year A.D.944 <br />crossed seas to Sri Lanka, and defeated the king Udaya-3 who <br />retreated from his capital Anuradhapura to Rohana in south Sri Lanka <br />with the Pandiyan treasure. </p>
<p>(15) Paranthaha Chola fails in his mission </p>
<p>Paranthaha finding difficult to penetrate into Rohana returned to <br />Chola country with much booty and treasures from Lanka, but failing <br />in his mission to retrieve the Pandiyan crown and royal insignia <br />from king Udaya-3. However Paranthaha with the defeat of the Sinhala <br />king assumed the new title the Singhalanthahan. </p>
<p>(16) Gandarathiththa Chola looses Pandiya Country </p>
<p>Paranthaha-1 was suceeeded on the Chola throne at Thanjavur by his <br />second son Gandarathiththa Chola (A.D.950-957), who spent almost his <br />entire period of rule in spiritualism as an ardent Saivite, and <br />finally was counted as one of the 63 great Saiva Saints of <br />TamilNadu. </p>
<p>(17) Arinjaya's short rule of Chola kingdom </p>
<p>He was followed by his younger brother Arinjaya Chola (A.D956-957) <br />at Thanjavur, who had very short rule. </p>
<p>(18) Chola Forces goes to Sri Lanka to assist the Commander Sena </p>
<p>He was followed by his son Sundera Chola (A.D.957-973) on the throne <br />at Thanjavur. During this period the Sri Lankan commander with much <br />animosity with his own king Sena-5 (A.D972-981) came to Chola <br />country and seeked military assistance from Sundera Chola, who sent <br />as much as 95,000 troops to Sri Lanka led by thr Chola General <br />Paranthahan Siriya Velan in A.D.954. </p>
<p>(19) Chola General Meets his death in the battle in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>In this battle Sena-5 was defeated and escaped to Rohana, but the <br />Chola commander met his death which made the forces to return to <br />their country. </p>
<p>(20) Rule of Utthama Chola </p>
<p>After the death of Sundera Chola in A.D.973 the lawful successor <br />prince Rajaraja Chola gave way to his paternal uncle Utthama Chola <br />(A.D.973-985) who was craving for the Chola throne, on the <br />understanding that the succession to the throne at Thanjavur to be <br />passed on to prince Rajaraja after the death of Utthama Chola. </p>
<p>(21) Rajaraja-1 succeeds on the Chola throne </p>
<p>Likewise in the the year A.D.985 Rajaraja - 1 came into power. <br />During this period in Sri Lanka king Mahinda-V (A.D.981-1029) ruling <br />from Anuradhapura in the wake of an internal rebellion by the Kerala <br />mercineries of his troops retreated to Rohana in A.D.991, and <br />continued to rule the southern half of the island. </p>
<p>This left the northern half in turmoil with no king for nearly <br />eleven years with various chieftains yeilding power from time to <br />time over territories in this region and a state of anarchy <br />prevailed. Rajaraja taking advantage of the situation crossed seas <br />and invaded Sri Lanka in his seventeenth year the A.D.1002. His <br />great army known as "muntrukai mahasenai' sacked the seaport city of <br />Mathottam the present Mantota and the interior capital of <br />Anuradhapura, and annexed the northen half of the island to his <br />empire. </p>
<p>Rajaraja too on his victory over the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka assumed <br />the a new title as Sinhalanthahan, and a village in Thanjavur in <br />Tamilnadu was named after this title as Singalanthahacchcheri. </p>
<p>(22) Polonnaruwa made the Chola capital in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>He named the captured northern half of Sri Lanka as Mummudi-<br />Cholamandalam after another of his titles, and further divided and <br />named them into various provinces. The present Polonnaruwa which <br />formed a part of the province Nigarili Cholavalanadu was made the <br />new capital of his island territorial possessions and was named as <br />Jananathamangalam also known as Jananathapuram. </p>
<p>(23) Tamil Trading Settlements established in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>During this period of Chola occupation the Tamil trading guilds <br />Thisaiayiratthu Annuruvar also known as Nanadesi Thisaiayirathu <br />Annuruvar and Nanadesis, the Valanjiyar and Nagaratthar who were <br />already trading in Sri Lanka further increased their activities in <br />the Island. </p>
<p>At Kataneri the present Vahalkade in the Anuradhapura district the <br />guild of Thisaiayyiratththu Annuruvar established a mercantile town <br />known as Virapattinam. Among the members of this guild was a trader <br />of high rank named Kanavathi Cholan alias Mavittamuriparan, a Chetti <br />trader from Java and an officer in charge of a mint in this town. </p>
<p>At Padaviya in the Anuradhapura district too there was a trading <br />establishment of this guild , and also a Siva temple in this area <br />under their protection. One of the traders here too was of a high <br />rank in the trading guild named Uththama Cholan alias Mandalattu <br />Chetti, and another named Kottaikutpatan Cholan alias Kollarun <br />Cinkan. </p>
<p>At Viharehinna near Moragolla in north Matale district <br />Thisaiayiratthu Annuruvar had established another mercantile town <br />known as the Virapattinam. </p>
<p>There had been further trading establishements of this guild at <br />Ilakattu Eba in Chilaw district, and at Detiyamulla and Gaitenpitiya <br />both in Kurunagala district. </p>
<p>In Polonnaruwa near the Rankot Vihara there had been a Buddhist <br />Vihare known as Bholapalli at the village Bahicintai under the <br />patronage of the guild of Thisaiayiraathu Annuruvar. </p>
<p>(24) Chola officials build Hindu Temples in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>During this period Chola Officials and Tamil traders built many <br />Hindu Temples for worship of Siva and Vishnu in the northern half of <br />Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>A Siva temple was built at Jananathamangalam also known as <br />Jananathpuram the present Polonnaruwa in the province of Nigarili <br />Cholavalanadu alias Pulainari, and was named as Vanavanmadevi <br />Iswarem after the queen of Raja Raja - 1. </p>
<p>They built another Sive temple at Padaviya in the Anuradhapura <br />disctrict and named it as Ravikulamaanikka Iswarem after one of the <br />titles of Rajaraja. Many Chola officials and traders around fifteen <br />of them have made endowements to this temple, and Chenkulavan <br />Katampan being one of them made donations in the year A.D.1005. </p>
<p>A further Siva Temple was built at Padaviya and was named as <br />Uththamar Koyil and there was also a brahmin settlement established <br />in this area known as 'Sripathi grama' </p>
<p>There was yet another Siva temple constructed at Atakade in the <br />Anuradhapura district and named as Uththama Chola Iswarem after the <br />Rajarja's predecessor to the Chola throne. </p>
<p>Chola officials also established settlements of Brahmin priests on <br />the lands of Rajavichadira valanadu covering the present Kantalai in <br />the Trincomalee district, and named it as Rajaraja <br />Chathurvedimangalam. </p>
<p>The region of Mathottam in Mannar alias Arunmolideva Valanadu was <br />renamed as Rajarajapuram, and a Siva temple was constructed by <br />Nallur Kilavan Taalikkumaran a Chola Officer in Sri Lanka during <br />this period, and was named as Rajaraja Iswarem. He also made <br />arrangements to celeberate the annual festival of Vaikasi Visakam <br />elaborately at this temple every year in the month of May. </p>
<p>During this period Cholas built another Siva temple at Rajarajapuram <br />alias Mathottam the present Mannar district and named it as <br />Thiruraameeswarem. </p>
<p>The artisans from the Chola country who came to Sri Lanka during <br />this period were employed in the construction of these temples and <br />in the casting of the bronze statues of Hindu deities for their <br />shrines. </p>
<p>(25) Mathotam made a seaport city of Cholas </p>
<p>The village of Mathottam alias Rajarajapuram in Mannar being the <br />closest port of call to the Chola warriors from the mainland <br />developed into an important city with many highways. One of these <br />highways was named as Rajaraja perumtheru. Another highway from this <br />city lead to Arulmolithevavalanadu apparently the present <br />Anuradhapura. </p>
<p>The Chola Officers also built an irrigation tank near <br />Iluppaikkadavai known as Cholamandalakkulam, north of Mathottam in <br />the Mannar district. There had been many weaving looms in this city <br />and tax collectors collected tax on these weaving looms and for <br />transport through the highways. </p>

<p>(40) Continuation of Chola activities in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>Cholas continued their hold on the northen half of Sri Lanka. During <br />this period the names of few Chola provinces in north Sri Lanka were <br />changed. The district where the Velgam Vihare was situated was re-<br />named from Sathvayasa Ramyana Manavatinanadu to Abayasiriyathannadu, <br />and from Melaithuru Sriyathan Parakesari valanadu to Rajendrasimha <br />valanadu. </p>
<p>It appears around this time time there had been a Buddhist temple at <br />Auradhapura named Madhavan Makothai Palli to which Tamil Artisons <br />etc jointly did renovations. </p>
<p>It appears it was during this time the Cholas exacavated a tank <br />named as Cholamandalakkulam on the east and in the close proximity <br />to the present Iluppaikkadavai in Mannar district. </p>

All his treasures were transported to the Chola kingdom and <br />consequently he commited suicide. </p>

<p>(55) Vijayabahu establishes himself at Rohana in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>During this period in Sri Lanka a local Kesadhatu chief named <br />Kassapa set up his rule at Rohana with his seat at Kataragama. <br />(Kathirkamam). </p>
<p>The Chola general stationed at Polonnaruwa not withstanding this <br />sent an army to Kattaragama against Kasspa in which the Chola forces <br />were defeated and retreated to the north. Kassapa now set up his <br />northern frontier at Rakkhapasana the present Rakwana and returd to <br />Kattaragama. </p>
<p>At this time the prince named Kitti the nephew of Vikkramabahu with <br />his seat at Sippathalaka also in Rohana was taking efforts to <br />establish himself in this province. But Kassayappa sent his forces <br />to futile his attempt where he was defeated, and prince Kitti became <br />the ruler of Rohana with royal name Vijayabahu. </p>
<p>He then made preparations to wage war with the Cholas in north Sri <br />Lanka, but Virarajendra ordered the Chola general Jeyamurinadalvar <br />stationed at Polonnaruwa to invade Kataragama. The Chola forces <br />plundered Kataragama, but Vijayabahu escaped capture and the Chola <br />forces returned to Polonnaruwa. Vijayabahu again returned to <br />Sippatthalaka with strong forces and gradually established himself <br />in Rohona. </p>
<p>(56) Vijayabahu seeks military aid from Burma </p>
<p>He made fresh preparations to attack the Cholas, and sent a few <br />years prior to A.D.1067 envoys with rich presents to king Anuruddha <br />(A.D.1044-1077) of Pagan who was also the overlord of Rammanadesa <br />both being in present Burma, requesting for military assistance <br />against Cholas. </p>
<p>King Anuruddha on the other hand with no intention to create any <br />enmity with the powerful Cholas, and also to prevent any strain in <br />relations with Sri lanka, sent instead many ships with various <br />valuable gifts to king Vijayabahu, who now changed his abode to <br />Tambalagama. </p>
<p>(57) Virarajendra sends fresh expedition to Sri Lanka </p>
<p>During this period in north Sri Lanka many inhabitants grew hostile <br />and paid no tributes to the Chola kingdom. Vijayabahu too continued <br />with his attempts to oust Cholas from Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>This made Virarajendra to send a fresh expedition to Sri Lanka in <br />the year A.D.1067 with many ships of large forces to the port of <br />Mathottam in north Sri Lanka under the general Kurukulaththaraiyan. </p>
<p>He successfully brought the Mummudi Chola mandalam the northern half <br />of Sri Lanka under the Chola control. He then proceeded to Rohana <br />with his forces where two mighty warriors of Vijayabahu, Ravideva <br />and Cala joined the Chola forces and fought against him. </p>
<p>In this battle the Chola general Kurukulatharaiyan, and another <br />commander lost their lives. This made Chola forces more furious in <br />which Rohana again fell into the hands of the Cholas who took <br />Vijayabahu's queen captive with many treasures while he escaped to <br />his hideout. Again the whole of Sri Lanka came under the Chola rule. </p>
<p>(58) Virarajendra issues gold coin in Sri Lanka </p>
<p>Virarajendra issued a gold coin so debased as to be hardly <br />distinguishable from silver having the legend Sri Rajendrah in <br />nagari letters and on the reverse the Chola tiger between two lamps <br />all under a canopy. </p>
<p>(59) Virarajendra Chola appoints his heir apparent </p>

<p>His untimely death with no heir apparent to succeed paved way for <br />prince Rajendra of Vengi Nadu, as the next legitimate successor to <br />the Chola throne through his maternal side in the year A.D.1071 with <br />the royal title Kulothunga Chola. </p>
<p>(61) Vijayabahu saves Sri Lanka from Chola imperialism </p>
<p>During this period in Sri Lanka the king Vijayabahu who earlier hid <br />in the south after his defeat at the hands of the Cholas, gradually <br />establised himself at Mahanagahula in the present Ambalangoda in <br />south Sri Lanka, and struggled valiantly to relieve the island from <br />the long standing grip of Cholas. </p>
<p>In the year A.D.1088 he sent two seperate armies with large forces <br />simultaneously to the north-central province of Sri Lanka against <br />the Chola forces. </p>
<p>The first unit of his troops intially captured the Chola strongholds <br />at the villages Muhunnuru, Badalatthagalla, Vapinagara, Buddhigama, <br />Tilagulla, Mahagalla, all in the Dakkinadesa the present Kurunagala <br />district and proceeded to Anuradhapura. Here too Chola forces were <br />defeated and the city of Anuradhapura was captured . These troops <br />further perssued and defeated the Chola forces upto the seaport of <br />Mathottam alias Mahathittha in Mannar district. </p>
<p>The second unit of troops of Vijayabahu was directed to the eastern <br />province avoiding the mountainous regions which defeated the Chola <br />forces at Chagama in the south-central region of Sri lanka. When <br />they reached Pullathinagara the present Polonnnaruwa the Sinhala <br />generals requested Vijayabahu to join them quickly with further <br />fresh forces. </p>
<p>Vijayabahu highly taken up by the heroic deeds of his forces <br />proceeded to Polonnaruwa with his valiant army from his town <br />Mahanugala. After the brief stay on the way in the close vicinity of <br />Mahiyangana Buddhist temple they reached Polonnaruwa along east <br />coast. </p>
<p>The Chola forces stationed at various places in the close vicinity <br />all gathered immediately at Polonnaruwa and had a great battle with <br />Sinhala forces. Vijayabahu's two great warriors Ravideva and Cala <br />who joined the Chola forces earlier against him, now re-joined <br />Vijayabahu and fought with determination to exterminate the Cholas, <br />and ending up with the victory to Sinhala forces. </p>
<p>Vijayabahu to commemorate his victory over Cholas in Sri Lanka, <br />assumed the title "Satru Rajachola Kula-anthaha'. </p>
<p>(62) Vijayabahu marries the Kanyakubja Pricess </p>
<p>During this period the wife and the daughter of the north Indian <br />king Jegathipala who were taken prisoners to Chola country after <br />defeat at the hands of Rajadhiraja-1 earlier at Rohana, escaped from <br />Chola country and came back to Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>They met the king Vijayabahu who later married the daughter <br />Leelawathie and took her as his first consort. </p>
<p>(63) KulothungaChola attempts peace with Sri Lanka </p>
<p>Kulothunga Chola on the reverse after a long weary expedition in the <br />far east seems to have decided to carry the balance regnal years in <br />peace and refrained from reacting further. </p>
<p>In confirming his friendly relations he sought the hands of the king <br />Vijayabahu's sister Mitta, but Vijayabahu with much animosity <br />against Cholas preferred the Pandiya prince in marriage to his <br />sister who were long time allies of the Sri Lankan kings. </p>
<p>(64) The beginning of the disintegration o the Chola empire </p>
<p>The loss of Sri Lanka from the fold of the Cholas marked the <br />beginning of the gradual disintegration of the Chola overseas empire <br />from its healm during the rule of Virarajendra. </p>
<p>(65) King Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka plans war with Chola country </p>
<p>Kulothunga to strengthen the good relations with Sri Lanka sent <br />envoys with rich presents to king Vijayabahu. during this same <br />period the Sinhala envoys who were on their way to Karnataka kingdom <br />in the Indian Mailand were humiliated in the Chola country by some <br />natives. </p>
<p>Vijayabahu to avenge his anger over this incidence challenged <br />Kulothunga for war through the same Chola envoys and gathered his <br />troops at the seaports of Mathottam and Mattikavatatittha in the <br />present Mannar district in the year A.D.1089. </p>
<p>The Velaikkara forces of Chola who choose to stay back in Sri Lanka <br />and serve the Sinhala king after their defeat by Vijayabahu earlier <br />now revolted against him on his plan to wage war with their <br />motherland. </p>
<p>In the revolt they caused destruction around Pulaththinagara the <br />present Polonnaruwa and captured the king's sister Mitta with her <br />three sons. Vijayabahu escaped rebels and moved to south. </p>
<p>However he returned back with his son Virabahu to Pulaththinagra <br />defeated the rebels, released Mitta and her sons and established <br />himself as the sole king of Sri lanka. </p>
<p>(66) King Vijayabahu revives ambition to wage war with Cholas </p>

<p>(67) Velaikkara Forces undertake to protect the Buddhist temple </p>

<p>All divisions of the Velaikkara forces, along with the Valanjiar, <br />Nagaraththar and others took charge of this temple which was named <br />as "Muntrukai Velaikkara Daladayaperumpalli", and jointly undertook <br />the management and protection of this temple and all villages given <br />to it as endowment. This they confirmed in Tamil on a stone slab <br />planted in the Polonnaruwa district and also on copper plates. </p>
<p>(68) Jayabahu succeeds Vijayabahu on Sinhala throne </p>
<p>In the same year of A.D.1114 Vijayabahu died, and was succeeded by <br />his brother Jayabahu as against the traditions of succession on Sri <br />Lankan throne preventing Vikkramabahu - 2 the son of Vijayabahu from <br />becoming the king. </p>
