<p>lovely legends in this site on the temple<br /><a href="http://tiruchendur.org/dutch.htm" title="http://tiruchendur.org/dutch.htm">http://tiruchendur.org/dutch.htm</a></p>
<p>A nice update on the temple builders<br /><a href="http://tiruchendur.org/tiruppani.htm" title="http://tiruchendur.org/tiruppani.htm">http://tiruchendur.org/tiruppani.htm</a></p>
<p>like this anecdote..</p>
<p>At this time, an accident to the principal idol of Subrahmanyam <br />necessitated the consecration of a fresh idol. A worshipper <br />afflicted with colic had rushed into the sanctum sanctorum and had <br />caught hold of the feet of the Lord Subrahmanyam to deliver him from <br />this dire affliction. The Potris and others in the sanctum were <br />amazed at this sudden move of the worshipper, and, they caught hold <br />of tbe man-to extricate his hold of the feet of the Lord. But <br />unfortunately his hold was fast and the idol gave way and had to be <br />replaced by a fresh one. The consequent Ashtabandhana Kumbhabishekam <br />of the new idol by the Trustees of the temples had to be performed <br />in 1909. The funds at their disposal were found insufficient; and <br />Mauna Swami offered an amount of Rs. 15,117_9_0 as his contribution <br />for the purpose from the Tiruppani exchequer. The consecration was <br />duly performed. </p>

<p>all over the place or even worse, the great beach used as an open air <br />restroom by many, may sound frustrating, Chendur is not that place to <br />be brought down by these cowards. Knowing the Lord and place, these <br />sinners get squished in this life time and births to follow.</p>
<blockquote><p>  That place is a high end cosmic place. One of the very few places <br />in India that has a very high cosmic connection, Tirupathi , Sabari </p></blockquote>
<p>malai, Palani, Sri Rangam, Ahobilam, Kamakshi and Meenakshi temples <br />to name a few in same levels (I do not discredit any other location <br />of any other temple or God however while I compare similar cosmic <br />levels - my personal favorite is Vayalur but these temples do not <br />fall under the same belt as Chendoor). </p>

<p>of the sea. It shudders my spine on how the Lance defies the law of <br />nature. I have been to Chendoor many times and have never seen any <br />disturbance in the sea, just ripples or small waves. </p>

<p>  Have been to this temple so many times, during the early days - it <br />  was truly a spiritual experience, combined with the pleasures of <br />  eating sillu karuppatti, buying mara choppu sets and ofcourse <br />  watching the temple elephants given a bath and body scrub with <br />  coconut husk n sengal...but the last few times, the place has <br />become <br />  very commerical and you see touts / guides even inside the sanctum <br />  santorium.</p>
<p>  but alas, during all those trips i was blind to history ... which <br />  makes me feel bad when i read below....it was there but i was not <br />  awake to realise..</p>
<p>  <a href="http://tiruchendur.org/inscriptions.htm" title="http://tiruchendur.org/inscriptions.htm">http://tiruchendur.org/inscriptions.htm</a></p>
<p>  There are four lithic inscriptions of the Pandya times collected <br />  together and planted now in a line in the southeastern corner of <br />the <br />  first circuit of the temple.

<p>Dear friends,<br />28th August Jaya TV News (7.30 PM) there was an interesting news-coverage on how human birth-stars are strengthened further in temples of Muruga, Guruvayur and Mookaambika. A Doctor from Dubai (Tamil) who is a research scholar also said in the report that most of temples in India has that quality and there is every scientific possibility to link the brain-wave system when they visit the temples. Though finally the news coverage ends with a message that astrology is a believable subject, those who know deeply about this can explain further....</p>

<blockquote><p>  Unfortunate ! The Temple that drove back Tsunami !</p>
<p>  sps</p></blockquote>
<p>Have been to this temple so many times, during the early days - it <br />was truly a spiritual experience, combined with the pleasures of <br />eating sillu karuppatti, buying mara choppu sets and ofcourse <br />watching the temple elephants given a bath and body scrub with <br />coconut husk n sengal...but the last few times, the place has become <br />very commerical and you see touts / guides even inside the sanctum <br />santorium.</p>
<p>but alas, during all those trips i was blind to history ... which <br />makes me feel bad when i read below....it was there but i was not <br />awake to realise..</p>
<p><a href="http://tiruchendur.org/inscriptions.htm" title="http://tiruchendur.org/inscriptions.htm">http://tiruchendur.org/inscriptions.htm</a></p>
<p>There are four lithic inscriptions of the Pandya times collected <br />together and planted now in a line in the southeastern corner of the <br />first circuit of the temple. Two of them belong to Pandya Varaguna <br />Maran of about 875 A.C.; the third of Pandya Mara Varman of about <br />1282 A.C.; and the fourth of Vikrama Pandya Deva. The inscriptions <br />of Varaguna speaks of his grant of 1,400 gold kasus or coins to the <br />temple, and the injunction that this sum should be invested as a <br />permanent loan among village assemblies, so that the interest <br />therefrom might be spent on this temple. </p>
<p>There is a mention of a shrine to Nakkira Deva, which speaks highly <br />of the literary advancement of the period, when famous poets were <br />deified and worshipped. Nakkirar was the President of the third <br />Tamil academy of poets at Madura and also the author of Tiru-murug-<br />arruppada the first of the Ten Idylls, known as Pathu Pattu; also <br />other works of high literary merit. The descriptive contents of the <br />inscriptions under reference are given below.* The fifth inscription <br />pertains to the local town temple. </p>
<p>No. 26 of 1912 (Vatteluttu) on two slabs set up in the Subrahmanya <br />temple. A record in the 13th year of the Pandya king Varaguna <br />Maraya. The inscription was partially copied in 1903. Registers that <br />the king who was a devotee of Subrahmania Bahtara provided 1,400 <br />gold coins (kasus) for the requirements of the temple throughout the <br />twelve months of the year. The money was distributed amongst the <br />sixteen villages which were required only to pay interest at two <br />kalams of paddy per year on each kasu borrowed, without disturbing <br />the principal (Note the rate of interest.) <br />No. 27 of 1912 (Tamil) on a stone pillar set up in the same place. A <br />record in the 13th year of the Pandya king Maravarman alias <br />Tirubuvanachakravarti Konermaikondan Vikrama Pandya Deva. Records <br />gift of two mass of land at Mankalakkurichi in Tiruvaladivalanadu to <br />a Brahmana of Parakrama Pandya Chaturvedimangalam in Karungudinadu. <br />(The king may be identical with him who came to the throne in A.D. <br />1282 and was the conqueror of Viraganda Gopala and Ganapati. Mr. <br />Krishna Sastri, however, believes that he was perhaps a contemporary <br />of Arikesari Parakrama, founder of the Tenkasi temple, as <br />Kaliyugaraman was). <br />No. 28 of 1912 (Tamil) on the same pillar. Records in Kollam Era <br />621, sale of land mentioned in No. 27 to Nakkiradeva Nayanar in the <br />temple of Subrahmania Pillaiyar at Tiruchendil for 630 <br />Kaliyugaranian panam (named after Vira Pandya, the contemporary of <br />Arikesari Parakrama). It is stated that this land which was at <br />Mangalakurichi alias Perunkarnunai Chaturvedimangalam was originally <br />granted to the Brahmana Atthigirinatha Bhattar and two others of <br />Parakrama Pandya Chaturvedimangalam by Ranarangarania Perumal alias <br />Vikrama Pandya Deva. The dedication of a shrine to Nakkira shows the <br />importance attached to in the age to literary greatness. <br />No. 155 of 1903 (Vattehittu) On a slab set up in the second prakara <br />of the Subrahmania temple. A record in the 13th year of Varaguna <br />Marayaharaja II. Records, gifts of money. The object of the <br />inscriptions is thus stated in order to meet the annual requirements <br />of the temple of Subrahmania-Bhatra, which was the deity in the <br />central shrine (Tirumulattanam) at Tiruchendur, Varaguna Maharaja <br />made a grant of 1,400 kasu and entrusted the amount to three of his <br />officers, viz., Iruppaikkudi-Kilavan, Sattamperuman and <br />Alarruranattukkon, with the stipulation that the money should be <br />lent out and with the interest accruing therefrom, the annual <br />requirements of the temple should be met, the capital always <br />remaining intact. No. 156 of 1903 (Tamil)-On the west and southwest <br />walls, of the Sivakkolundiswara temple at Tiruchendur. An incomplete <br />record in Kollam Era 650, Tiruchendr was also called Madevi-<br />Chaturvedil-mangalam </p>

<blockquote><p>  heard there was an unfortunate accident today in tirchendur and <br />the <br />  mandapam fell down...</p>

<p>  A nice update on the temple builders<br />  <a href="http://tiruchendur.org/tiruppani.htm" title="http://tiruchendur.org/tiruppani.htm">http://tiruchendur.org/tiruppani.htm</a></p>
<p>  like this anecdote..</p>
<p>  At this time, an accident to the principal idol of Subrahmanyam <br />  necessitated the consecration of a fresh idol. A worshipper <br />  afflicted with colic had rushed into the sanctum sanctorum and had <br />  caught hold of the feet of the Lord Subrahmanyam to deliver him <br />from <br />  this dire affliction. The Potris and others in the sanctum were <br />  amazed at this sudden move of the worshipper, and, they caught <br />hold <br />  of tbe man-to extricate his hold of the feet of the Lord. But <br />  unfortunately his hold was fast and the idol gave way and had to <br />be <br />  replaced by a fresh one. The consequent Ashtabandhana <br />Kumbhabishekam <br />  of the new idol by the Trustees of the temples had to be performed <br />  in 1909. The funds at their disposal were found insufficient; and <br />  Mauna Swami offered an amount of Rs. 15,117_9_0 as his <br />contribution <br />  for the purpose from the Tiruppani exchequer. The consecration was <br />  duly performed.</p>
