<p>Merchant associations or guilds were features common to many medieval <br />economies.</p>
<p>The major Asian trade boom of the tenth to thirteenth centuries <br />appears to have stimulated a significant restructuring of the <br />administration of trade in most major economies of Asia, North Africa <br />and Europe. </p>
<p>The Middle Eastern commenda-type investment contract (qirad, etc.), <br />which had become such an important tool of commercial activity in the <br />Middle East by the tenth century, was introduced into Italian <br />seaports by the early eleventh century, thus providing a major <br />impetus for the expansion of trade in medieval Europe.</p>
<p>(1) In China, the hang developed from a trading quarter into a nearly <br />autonomous trade association, and the organization of collective <br />financing and management of overseas shipping ventures became <br />increasingly complex.(2) And in southern India a series of merchant <br />associations developed powerful networks and vertical monopolies that <br />included not only tied manufacturers but also private armies. These <br />associations received a good deal of local political encouragement.</p>
<p>Southern India, because its tracts of cultivated land were more <br />dispersed and limited than those of north India, was never the locus <br />of large agrarian states. For much of the region's history, power was <br />fairly evenly balanced between three or more medium-sized states with <br />different linguistic characters: Tamil on the southeast (Coromandel <br />or Cholamandala) coast; Malayalam along the southwest (Malabar) <br />coast; Telegu on the eastern (Andhra) coast north of the Tamil <br />heartland; and Kanarese on the western (now Konkan) coast to the <br />north of the Malabar region. Many of these states relied upon <br />overseas trade to enhance their limited agricultural income. The <br />Pallavas were the first Tamil rulers of real consequence. </p>
<p>They grew in power from the mid-sixth to the mid-eighth centuries, <br />and their contacts with Southeast Asia are reflected in many of the <br />early Hindu remains of the maritime region.</p>
<p>Pallava power began to decline in the later eighth century, and by <br />the later ninth century they had been replaced as the leading power <br />in the southeast by the Cholas. </p>
<p>The Cholas built upon the economic networks developed by the <br />Pallavas, and expanded their links with merchant associations.</p>
<p>Much of southern India's sea trade during the late first and early <br />second millennia was controlled by these merchant associations, the <br />most important of which appear to have first formed in southwest <br />India.</p>
<p>During the eighth and ninth centuries much of southwest India's <br />trade had been directed towards the west, and a number of Muslim, <br />Jewish, Zoroastrian and Christian merchant groups from western Asia <br />and the Middle East had established trading enclaves on the Malabar <br />coast. </p>
<p>It was in this context that at least some of the early Indian <br />merchant associations began to form. The Manigramam, one of the <br />earliest of the south Indian merchant associations to appear in local <br />records, was mentioned in the late ninth century Kottayam (Sthanu <br />Ravi) copper plate inscriptions found near Quilon on the Malabar <br />coast. These record a contract between the local authority and a <br />group of resident Christians from the Persian Gulf allowing them <br />access, free of certain taxes, to the fort which protected the port <br />market, apparently operated by the merchant group.(3) This merchant <br />association appears to have extended its influence to the east coast <br />shortly afterwards, probably with political encouragement, since the <br />Pallava rulers of the southeast had maintained close relations with <br />the Chera state of the Malabar coast.</p>
<p>During the same period another merchant association had begun to form <br />further to the north in the western Deccan, at Aihole (called <br />Ayyavole in Kannada and Aryapura in Sanskrit) in the Chalukya <br />heartland behind the Konkan coast.(4) They were known either as the <br />Ayyavole/Aryapura association (after their eighth or ninth century <br />place of origin), or more generally as the Ainnurruvar ("The Five <br />Hundred"). This group rapidly became the most powerful of the <br />merchant associations. A number of other merchant groups are known to <br />have affiliated themselves with the Ayyavole, those most prominent in <br />sea trade being the Manigramam and the Nanadesi. In addition, at its <br />height, the Ayyavole appears to have occupied a dominant position in <br />relation to at least forty-six other professional bodies, including <br />major associations of artisans and mercenaries.(5)</p>
<p>The trend in southern India towards merchant domination of certain <br />crafts appears to have accelerated after the turn of the millennium, <br />under Chola rule, with the effective creation of vertical artisan-<br />merchant monopolies. Knock-on effects of the Asian trade boom that <br />were experienced in India included such developments in the weaving <br />and dyeing industries as the introduction - possibly by the eleventh <br />century - of the draw loom, and of the spinning wheel by the <br />thirteenth century.(6) Block-printed textiles, resist-dyed with <br />indigo or mordant-dyed with madder or morinda, were exported in large <br />quantities to both the Middle East and Southeast Asia by the <br />thirteenth century.(7) On the back of this expanding manufacturing <br />and trading base, merchant groups gained a large degree of control <br />over the non-agrarian economy in southern India, assuming the role of <br />major patrons of religious establishments, and being drawn into the <br />collection of certain tolls and taxes on behalf of the state.(8)</p>
<p>Under Chola rule merchant associations appear to have dominated the <br />internal and external trade of south India and parts of Sri Lanka <br />from the late ninth century to the late thirteenth century. The <br />general Sanskrit term for such corporate trading communities was <br />vanigrama ("community of merchants"), and more than one association <br />appears to have used this term or a local variant in their titles: <br />Vanigrama was taken as their title by a group of merchants mentioned <br />in a tenth-century Sri Lankan inscription,(9) and the term Manigramam <br />was a local variant.</p>
<p>The slow decline of the Chola state had already begun before the end <br />of the twelfth century. During the thirteenth century, this decline <br />accelerated into a collapse, as the Pandyans in the far south, the <br />Hoysalas in Karnataka, and local chiefs in northern Tamil Nadu carved <br />up the Chola territory.(10) Zhao Rugua (Chau Ju-kua), writing in the <br />port of Quanzhou in 1225 A.D., recorded reports that the Chola state <br />was at war with its neighbours, although it was still - like several <br />states on the western Gujarati, Konkan, and Malabar coasts, and a <br />number of states on the east coast of India - an active exporter of <br />cotton textiles.(11) This impression of changing fortunes is <br />reinforced by the three early thirteenth century hoards of Chinese <br />coins found on the coast of Tamil Nadu,(12) which were probably <br />abandoned by the mid-thirteenth century due to local upheavals. The <br />mid-thirteenth century efforts of the Kakatiyan ruler Ganapati to <br />revive trade in the southeast Indian port of Motupalli by promising <br />greater safety and stability reflect the growing turbulence in the <br />region.(13)</p>
<p>The remnants of the Chola state were eventually incorporated into the <br />fourteenth-century kingdom of Vijayanagar. Although foreign trade <br />continued under Vijayanagar patronage, the broad consumer base and <br />integrated regional economy of the later Chola period were lacking. <br />By the fourteenth century the great merchant associations were <br />issuing fewer inscriptions, suggesting that - although these <br />associations continued to exist into the seventeenth century - either <br />their structures and modes of operation were changing, or their <br />economic and political power were declining. Despite these changes, <br />individual traders on India's coasts continued to export the cotton <br />textiles and dyestuffs that were increasingly in demand both in the <br />Middle East and in maritime Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>SOUTH INDIAN MERCHANTS MENTIONED IN JAVANESE SOURCES</p>
<p>South Indian merchant associations appear to have begun to extend <br />their activities abroad during the ninth century. At first, despite <br />their apparent involvement in the portage trade across the Thai <br />peninsula (see below), the main overseas trade focus of the Ayyavole <br />and the Manigramam seems to have been the western sector of the <br />Indian Ocean and the Middle East. By the tenth century, however, the <br />Asian sea trade boom had begun to draw more East and Southeast Asian <br />trade into the Indian Ocean. </p>
<p>The domestic and port trade activities of both of these associations <br />spread during the tenth and eleventh centuries across the interior <br />and to the east coast regions ofTamil Nadu, Karnataka, southern <br />Kalinga, the Pandyan south and into northern Sri Lanka,(14) largely <br />under the auspices of the expanding Chola state. The associations <br />remained powerful along the east coast into the thirteenth century, <br />but lost ground as the Chola state was dismembered towards the end of <br />that century.</p>
<p>The direct impact of the south Indian merchant associations in <br />Southeast Asia was limited both temporally and geographically, <br />probably because of the strength of competing local vested interests <br />in trade. It is also important to note that not all South Asians <br />trading in maritime Southeast Asia during the Asian sea trade boom <br />were clearly associated with South Indian merchant groups. </p>
<p>Although the surviving records are too fragmentary to provide a clear <br />picture of the structure of trading communities in early Malay and <br />Sumatran states, epigraphic evidence from Java and Bali of this <br />period suggests that South Asians were present in the local ports in <br />large enough numbers to be classified by region. </p>
<p>These inscriptions also indicate that while the term banigrama (the <br />Javanized version of vanigrama) was used in Javanese and Balinese <br />port texts for a time, these banigrama appear to have been rather <br />fluid, port-based groupings that incorporated both local and foreign <br />merchants, some of whom were acting as tax farmers under licence from <br />local rulers.</p>
<p>Javanese inscriptions are particularly rich in information about <br />overseas trade connections. Shifts over time in the composition of <br />the lists of foreigners who were resident at ports in Java appear to <br />reflect changing patterns of trade.(15) The earliest dated original <br />inscription to contain such a list is that of Kalirungan(16) from <br />Kedu in central Java, dated 883 A.D. </p>
<p>The list of foreign traders in this inscription includes mainland <br />Southeast Asians from Campa (Champa), Remman (Ramanyadesa, in Mon <br />Lower Burma), and Kmira (Cambodia); the listed South Asians came from <br />Kling (Kalinga), Aryya (Aryapura/Ayyavole), Pandikira (in Kamataka), <br />and perhaps Singhala (Sri Lanka) - although this last reading is <br />uncertain. The one surviving original inscription of the early tenth <br />century to contain a list of foreigners - the Palebuhan charter of <br />927 A.D., which concerns a community on the banks of the Solo river <br />near Madiun(17) - is, unfortunately, only partially legible.</p>
<p>The names Singhala, Pandikira, and Ramman have, however, been <br />preserved, suggesting that the composition of the lists had not <br />changed markedly in the forty-four years following the Kalirungan <br />inscription. The Indians in Javanese ports during the later ninth and <br />early tenth centuries appear to have been drawn either from the east <br />coast districts of what are now Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and <br />southern Orissa, or from the western Konkan coastal region already <br />dominated by the Ayyavole merchant association. These three regions <br />remained a constant in the Javanese lists from the ninth to the <br />fourteenth century. </p>
<p>The two east coast regions of India - particularly that of Kalinga - <br />appear to have been important sources of cotton textiles at an early <br />date. Example kalingam means textile in tamil <br />It was perhaps because of the region's dominance of the early textile <br />exports to Southeast Asia that the term "Kling" was widely adopted in <br />the Indonesian archipelago as a blanket-term covering all South <br />Asians, and in some cases all foreigners from the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The tenth-eleventh century shift in focus of the merchant <br />associations from the west coast of southern India towards the east, <br />stimulated by increasing trade with the Southeast Asia and China, was <br />accompanied by a broadening of the range of commodities traded. South <br />Indian trade with the Middle East had been dominated by such exports <br />as black pepper, areca nuts and iron.</p>
<p>(18) Iron remained a major export to the West into the thirteenth <br />century and may have played an important role in trade with such <br />Southeast Asian states as Java and Bali, which had few of their own <br />iron sources. However, with the expansion of merchant association <br />activities to the east coast of India, particularly in the cotton-<br />producing region stretching from northern Tamil Nadu through <br />Karnataka to the southern coast of Kalinga, cotton textiles began to <br />gain more prominence in the list of exports.</p>
<p>Changes in the textile patterns illustrated on Javanese statuary of <br />the later tenth and eleventh centuries reflect the rapid rise in <br />popularity of Indian export cloths at this time.(19) Four original <br />Javanese inscriptions containing lists of foreigners survive from the <br />eleventh century. They range in date from the 1020s to the 1050s. </p>
<p>The Cane inscription of 1021 A.D.,(20) from the Brantas delta region <br />of east Java, lists foreigners from Kling, Aryya, Singhala, <br />Pandikira, Drawida, Campa, Remen, and Kmir. The inscription of <br />Patakan,(21) from the same district, lacks a legible date, but was <br />commissioned in the same period and contains an identical list. </p>
<p>The new name in these two lists, Drawida, refers to the east coast <br />Dravidian region of Tamil Nadu, where the Cholas had overthrown the <br />Pallavas late in the ninth century. The Cholas - who gained power <br />within southern India towards the end of the tenth century, and then <br />extended their influence into Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Laccadives <br />by the first decade of the eleventh century - had by this time joined <br />the merchants operating in the larger ports in maritime Southeast <br />Asia. The Chola state had clearly become, by the 1020s, a major <br />player in the eastern sector of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Chinese records indicate that textiles gained in importance among <br />Indian exports to the East in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br />(22) Further changes in the textiles illustrated on Javanese statuary <br />reflect the growing influence of certain densely-patterned block-<br />printed Indian export textiles during this period.(23) By the 1040s <br />and 1050s, when the Turun Hyang(24) and Garaman(25) inscriptions were <br />written, two changes had taken place in names already contained in <br />the lists: Drawida had been replaced by Colika (Chola), and Pandikira <br />by Karnataka. The Garaman inscription of 1053 A.D. also adds to the <br />list the name Malyala (the Malayala-speaking region of the Malabar <br />coast).</p>
<p>By this time most of the merchants arriving from the named South <br />Asian regions, including those from southern Kalinga, were probably <br />operating from regions controlled by the Chola empire, and may well <br />have been members of the dominant or subsidiary south Indian merchant <br />associations. However, those residing in Javanese ports appear to <br />have been connected to the Javanese court as individuals - rather <br />than as representatives of merchant associations - in their roles as <br />tax farmers in east Java.</p>
<p>They appear to have operated on the same footing as local merchants <br />or those from elsewhere in Southeast Asia.(26)</p>
<p>There appears to have been a lengthy hiatus in the writing of <br />inscriptions in coastal regions of east Java between the middle of <br />the eleventh century, when the state of Mataram broke in half, and <br />the end of the thirteenth century. Of the two states formed from the <br />division of Mataram, the coastally-oriented Javanese state of <br />Janggala, though active in trade, left few records on permanent <br />materials - unlike its sister state, Kadiri, in the interior. </p>
<p>The state of Singhasari, formed in 1222 by reuniting the two halves <br />of former Mataram, also left few written remains. It was not until <br />the Majapahit court replaced that of Singhasari in about 1292 A.D. <br />that inscriptions were again written in any number on permanent <br />materials - though many of these were merely reissues of earlier <br />charters. </p>
<p>The Balawi inscription of 1305 A.D.(27) is the only original <br />Majapahit inscription found to date that contains a list of tax-<br />farming foreigners. The list reads as follows:</p>
<p>"...wargga kilalan (tax-farmer group): Kling, Aryya, [.....], <br />Singhala, Karnataka, [.....], Cina (China), Campa (Champa), Mandisi <br />(?), Caremin (Ramanyadesa), Kmir (Cambodia),..."</p>
<p>The significant addition found in this list is China, whose merchants <br />had, by the twelfth century, been encouraged by the financially-<br />pressed Chinese court to carry trade abroad - rather than sit and <br />wait for it to arrive. By the thirteenth century Chinese traders <br />appear to have begun to outnumber Indian traders in some ports, just <br />as Chinese-style currency had already begun to displace the earlier <br />forms of indigenous currency in Java and Bali.(28) During the Mongol <br />period at least some of these Chinese merchants may have felt more <br />comfortable operating from non-Chinese ports. At the same time, the <br />regions of India represented in the legible portion of the Balawi <br />list were those that had been there from the ninth century onwards - <br />the east-coast regions of Andhra Pradesh and Coromandel, and the west-<br />coast Aryapura/Ayyavole heartland of the dominant (though now fading) <br />merchant association. The decline of the Chola empire and the partial <br />disruption of trade in eastern waters during the late thirteenth and <br />early fourteenth centuries clearly had not led to an abandoning of <br />trade links between Indian ports and those of maritime Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The Nagarakertagama,(29) a Javanese text completed around 1365 A.D., <br />mentions merchants and others from China, various parts of Southeast <br />Asia, and Jambudwipa (India) - specifically from Goda (Gaur in <br />Bengal) and Kamataka, these two regions having by then pulled away <br />from the control of the sultanate of Delhi. The continued importance <br />of the Tamil-speaking Kamataka coast, in particular, in Javanese <br />lists of Indian traders may have had much to do with the textile <br />trade. Patterned textiles represented on thirteenth- and fourteenth-<br />century statuary from east Java bear a very close resemblance to some <br />of the patterns preserved on fragments of Indian export textiles of <br />those centuries found at Egyptian sites.(30) Although some of the <br />patterns on Javanese statuary may represent local batik copies of <br />Indian export cloths, there is no doubt that Indian printed cottons <br />were hugely popular all around the Indian Ocean - and beyond - by <br />this time. Even during this century of relative trade depression in <br />parts of maritime Southeast Asia, India's cottons found a ready <br />market.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>yes Subramaniam,</p>
<p>This time one more article from Bengal website</p>
<p>Mahipala Vs Rajendra chola (Distance between the two country is 2000 <br />km)</p>
<p>Mahipala I (c 995-1043 AD) is considered the second founder of the <br />pala dynasty. </p>
<p>The existence of the continuous rule of the chandra dynasty in this <br />area from the early 10th century AD onwards is now established beyond <br />any doubt. Govindachandra was a contemporary of Mahipala and Rajendra <br />Chola's army found both of them, the former in Vangaladesha and the <br />latter in Uttara Radha.<br />Mahipala held authority over southern Bihar (Magadha) and towards the <br />close of his reign over northern Bihar. </p>
<p>The Chola inscription (Tirumulai inscription), which records Rajendra <br />Chola's invasion of Bengal some time in between 1021 and 1024 AD, <br />throws further light on the condition of Bengal.</p>
<p>The inscription records that after conquering Orissa the Chola <br />general seized Dandabhukti after having destroyed Dharmapala <br />(possibly belonging to the Kamboja line) and reached southern Radha <br />where he met Ranashura. Then the army reached Vangaladesha, where the <br />rainwater never stopped, and Govindachandra fled having descended <br />from his elephant and subsequently they met Mahipala in northern <br />Radha.</p>
<p>The narration of the Chola inscription clearly places Govindachandra <br />in south-eastern Bengal and Mahipala is northern and western Bengal. </p>
<p>Mahipala seems to have a long reign as his two Imadpur inscriptions <br />are dated in his 48th year. Mahipala, on his accession, found the <br />Pala empire confined to southern Bihar and in his early years he <br />fought successfully to recover northern and western Bengal from the <br />Kambojas. </p>
<p>Towards the close of his reign he succeeded in spreading Pala <br />authority in northern Bihar. So he must be given the credit for re-<br />establishing Pala authority over their original kingdom, except a <br />portion of southern west Bengal, where Ranasura and Dharmapala ruled.</p>
<p>Mahipala was better known for his peaceful pursuits. A number of <br />towns and large tanks still bear his name. Mahiganj in Rangpur <br />district, Mahipur in Bogra district, Mahisantosa in Dinajpur district <br />and Mahipala in Murshidabad district; Mahipaladighi (tank) in <br />Dinajpur and Mahipala's Sagardighi in Murshidabad - all these still <br />bear testimony to his deeds and the high esteem in which the people <br />held him. </p>
<p>It is further reflected in the numerous ballads believed to exist in <br />Bengal commemorating his name. Brndaban Das wrote in his chaitanya <br />bhagavat (1572 AD) that the people of Bengal in the early part of the <br />16th century were very fond of these songs of Mahipala.</p>
<p>The popularity of these songs and the name of Mahipala are reflected <br />in the common saying, Dhan bhante Mahipaler git (songs of Mahipala <br />while husking rice), which is still prevalent in rural Bengal. </p>
<p>Possibly after early years of war Mahipala devoted himself to <br />peaceful pursuits and religious activities. His public works endeared <br />him to the hearts of the people of Bengal. </p>
<p>The excavations at paharpur have revealed the revival of Pala power <br />under Mahipala as manifest in the wholesale renovation of the main <br />temple and in the monastic cells and in the numerous votive stupas at <br />the shrine of Tara in the Satyapir Bhita</p>

<p>  MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS AND MEDIEVAL TRADE IN SOUTH INDIA</p>
<p>  Merchant associations or guilds were features common to many <br />medieval<br />  economies.</p>
<p>  The major Asian trade boom of the tenth to thirteenth centuries <br />appears<br />  to have stimulated a significant restructuring of the <br />administration of<br />  trade in most major economies of Asia, North Africa and Europe. </p>
<p>  The Middle Eastern commenda-type investment contract (qirad, etc.),<br />  which had become such an important tool of commercial activity in <br />the<br />  Middle East by the tenth century, was introduced into Italian <br />seaports<br />  by the early eleventh century, thus providing a major impetus for <br />the<br />  expansion of trade in medieval Europe.</p>
<p>  (1) In China, the hang developed from a trading quarter into a <br />nearly<br />  autonomous trade association, and the organization of collective<br />  financing and management of overseas shipping ventures became<br />  increasingly complex.(2) And in southern India a series of merchant<br />  associations developed powerful networks and vertical monopolies <br />that<br />  included not only tied manufacturers but also private armies. These<br />  associations received a good deal of local political encouragement.</p>
<p>  Southern India, because its tracts of cultivated land were more<br />  dispersed and limited than those of north India, was never the <br />locus of<br />  large agrarian states. For much of the region's history, power was<br />  fairly evenly balanced between three or more medium-sized states <br />with<br />  different linguistic characters: Tamil on the southeast (Coromandel <br />or<br />  Cholamandala) coast; Malayalam along the southwest (Malabar) coast;   Telegu on the eastern (Andhra) coast north of the Tamil heartland; <br />and<br />  Kanarese on the western (now Konkan) coast to the north of the <br />Malabar<br />  region. Many of these states relied upon overseas trade to enhance <br />their<br />  limited agricultural income. The Pallavas were the first Tamil <br />rulers of<br />  real consequence. </p>
<p>  They grew in power from the mid-sixth to the mid-eighth centuries, <br />and<br />  their contacts with Southeast Asia are reflected in many of the <br />early<br />  Hindu remains of the maritime region.</p>
<p>  Pallava power began to decline in the later eighth century, and by <br />the<br />  later ninth century they had been replaced as the leading power in <br />the<br />  southeast by the Cholas. </p>
<p>  The Cholas built upon the economic networks developed by the <br />Pallavas,<br />  and expanded their links with merchant associations.</p>
<p>  Much of southern India's sea trade during the late first and early<br />  second millennia was controlled by these merchant associations, the <br />most<br />  important of which appear to have first formed in southwest India.</p>
<p>  During the eighth and ninth centuries much of southwest India's <br />trade<br />  had been directed towards the west, and a number of Muslim, Jewish,<br />  Zoroastrian and Christian merchant groups from western Asia and the<br />  Middle East had established trading enclaves on the Malabar coast. </p>
<p>  It was in this context that at least some of the early Indian <br />merchant<br />  associations began to form. The Manigramam, one of the earliest of <br />the<br />  south Indian merchant associations to appear in local records, was<br />  mentioned in the late ninth century Kottayam (Sthanu<br />  Ravi) copper plate inscriptions found near Quilon on the Malabar <br />coast.<br />  These record a contract between the local authority and a group of<br />  resident Christians from the Persian Gulf allowing them access, <br />free of<br />  certain taxes, to the fort which protected the port market, <br />apparently<br />  operated by the merchant group.(3) This merchant association <br />appears to<br />  have extended its influence to the east coast shortly afterwards,<br />  probably with political encouragement, since the Pallava rulers of <br />the<br />  southeast had maintained close relations with the Chera state of the<br />  Malabar coast.</p>
<p>  During the same period another merchant association had begun to <br />form<br />  further to the north in the western Deccan, at Aihole (called <br />Ayyavole<br />  in Kannada and Aryapura in Sanskrit) in the Chalukya heartland <br />behind<br />  the Konkan coast.(4) They were known either as the Ayyavole/Aryapura<br />  association (after their eighth or ninth century place of origin), <br />or<br />  more generally as the Ainnurruvar ("The Five Hundred"). This group<br />  rapidly became the most powerful of the merchant associations. A <br />number<br />  of other merchant groups are known to have affiliated themselves <br />with<br />  the Ayyavole, those most prominent in sea trade being the <br />Manigramam and<br />  the Nanadesi. In addition, at its height, the Ayyavole appears to <br />have<br />  occupied a dominant position in relation to at least forty-six other<br />  professional bodies, including major associations of artisans and<br />  mercenaries.(5)</p>
<p>  The trend in southern India towards merchant domination of certain<br />  crafts appears to have accelerated after the turn of the millennium,<br />  under Chola rule, with the effective creation of vertical artisan-<br />  merchant monopolies. Knock-on effects of the Asian trade boom that <br />were<br />  experienced in India included such developments in the weaving and<br />  dyeing industries as the introduction - possibly by the eleventh <br />century<br />  - of the draw loom, and of the spinning wheel by the thirteenth<br />  century.(6) Block-printed textiles, resist-dyed with indigo or<br />  mordant-dyed with madder or morinda, were exported in large <br />quantities<br />  to both the Middle East and Southeast Asia by the thirteenth <br />century.(7)<br />  On the back of this expanding manufacturing and trading base, <br />merchant<br />  groups gained a large degree of control over the non-agrarian <br />economy in<br />  southern India, assuming the role of major patrons of religious<br />  establishments, and being drawn into the collection of certain <br />tolls and<br />  taxes on behalf of the state.(8)</p>
<p>  Under Chola rule merchant associations appear to have dominated the<br />  internal and external trade of south India and parts of Sri Lanka <br />from<br />  the late ninth century to the late thirteenth century. The general<br />  Sanskrit term for such corporate trading communities was vanigrama<br />  ("community of merchants"), and more than one association appears to<br />  have used this term or a local variant in their titles: <br />  Vanigrama was taken as their title by a group of merchants <br />mentioned in<br />  a tenth-century Sri Lankan inscription,(9) and the term Manigramam <br />was a<br />  local variant.</p>
<p>  The slow decline of the Chola state had already begun before the <br />end of<br />  the twelfth century. During the thirteenth century, this decline<br />  accelerated into a collapse, as the Pandyans in the far south, the<br />  Hoysalas in Karnataka, and local chiefs in northern Tamil Nadu <br />carved up<br />  the Chola territory.(10) Zhao Rugua (Chau Ju-kua), writing in the <br />port<br />  of Quanzhou in 1225 A.D., recorded reports that the Chola state was <br />at<br />  war with its neighbours, although it was still - like several <br />states on<br />  the western Gujarati, Konkan, and Malabar coasts, and a number of <br />states<br />  on the east coast of India - an active exporter of cotton textiles.<br />(11)<br />  This impression of changing fortunes is reinforced by the three <br />early<br />  thirteenth century hoards of Chinese coins found on the coast of <br />Tamil<br />  Nadu,(12) which were probably abandoned by the mid-thirteenth <br />century<br />  due to local upheavals. The mid-thirteenth century efforts of the<br />  Kakatiyan ruler Ganapati to revive trade in the southeast Indian <br />port of<br />  Motupalli by promising greater safety and stability reflect the <br />growing<br />  turbulence in the<br />  region.(13)</p>
<p>  The remnants of the Chola state were eventually incorporated into <br />the<br />  fourteenth-century kingdom of Vijayanagar. Although foreign trade<br />  continued under Vijayanagar patronage, the broad consumer base and<br />  integrated regional economy of the later Chola period were lacking. <br />  By the fourteenth century the great merchant associations were <br />issuing<br />  fewer inscriptions, suggesting that - although these associations<br />  continued to exist into the seventeenth century - either their<br />  structures and modes of operation were changing, or their economic <br />and<br />  political power were declining. Despite these changes, individual<br />  traders on India's coasts continued to export the cotton textiles <br />and<br />  dyestuffs that were increasingly in demand both in the Middle East <br />and<br />  in maritime Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>  SOUTH INDIAN MERCHANTS MENTIONED IN JAVANESE SOURCES</p>
<p>  South Indian merchant associations appear to have begun to extend <br />their<br />  activities abroad during the ninth century. At first, despite their<br />  apparent involvement in the portage trade across the Thai peninsula <br />(see<br />  below), the main overseas trade focus of the Ayyavole and the <br />Manigramam<br />  seems to have been the western sector of the Indian Ocean and the <br />Middle<br />  East. By the tenth century, however, the Asian sea trade boom had <br />begun<br />  to draw more East and Southeast Asian trade into the Indian Ocean. </p>
<p>  The domestic and port trade activities of both of these associations<br />  spread during the tenth and eleventh centuries across the interior <br />and<br />  to the east coast regions ofTamil Nadu, Karnataka, southern <br />Kalinga, the<br />  Pandyan south and into northern Sri Lanka,(14) largely under the<br />  auspices of the expanding Chola state. The associations remained<br />  powerful along the east coast into the thirteenth century, but lost<br />  ground as the Chola state was dismembered towards the end of that<br />  century.</p>
<p>  The direct impact of the south Indian merchant associations in <br />Southeast<br />  Asia was limited both temporally and geographically, probably <br />because of<br />  the strength of competing local vested interests in trade. It is <br />also<br />  important to note that not all South Asians trading in maritime<br />  Southeast Asia during the Asian sea trade boom were clearly <br />associated<br />  with South Indian merchant groups. </p>
<p>  Although the surviving records are too fragmentary to provide a <br />clear<br />  picture of the structure of trading communities in early Malay and<br />  Sumatran states, epigraphic evidence from Java and Bali of this <br />period<br />  suggests that South Asians were present in the local ports in large<br />  enough numbers to be classified by region. </p>
<p>  These inscriptions also indicate that while the term banigrama (the<br />  Javanized version of vanigrama) was used in Javanese and Balinese <br />port<br />  texts for a time, these banigrama appear to have been rather fluid,<br />  port-based groupings that incorporated both local and foreign <br />merchants,<br />  some of whom were acting as tax farmers under licence from local <br />rulers.</p>
<p>  Javanese inscriptions are particularly rich in information about<br />  overseas trade connections. Shifts over time in the composition of <br />the<br />  lists of foreigners who were resident at ports in Java appear to <br />reflect<br />  changing patterns of trade.(15) The earliest dated original <br />inscription<br />  to contain such a list is that of Kalirungan(16) from Kedu in <br />central<br />  Java, dated 883 A.D. </p>
<p>  The list of foreign traders in this inscription includes mainland<br />  Southeast Asians from Campa (Champa), Remman (Ramanyadesa, in Mon <br />Lower<br />  Burma), and Kmira (Cambodia); the listed South Asians came from <br />Kling<br />  (Kalinga), Aryya (Aryapura/Ayyavole), Pandikira (in Kamataka), and<br />  perhaps Singhala (Sri Lanka) - although this last reading is <br />uncertain.<br />  The one surviving original inscription of the early tenth century to<br />  contain a list of foreigners - the Palebuhan charter of<br />  927 A.D., which concerns a community on the banks of the Solo river <br />near<br />  Madiun(17) - is, unfortunately, only partially legible.</p>
<p>  The names Singhala, Pandikira, and Ramman have, however, been<br />  preserved, suggesting that the composition of the lists had not <br />changed<br />  markedly in the forty-four years following the Kalirungan <br />inscription.<br />  The Indians in Javanese ports during the later ninth and early tenth<br />  centuries appear to have been drawn either from the east coast <br />districts<br />  of what are now Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and southern Orissa, or <br />from<br />  the western Konkan coastal region already dominated by the Ayyavole<br />  merchant association. These three regions remained a constant in the<br />  Javanese lists from the ninth to the fourteenth century. </p>
<p>  The two east coast regions of India - particularly that of Kalinga -<br />  appear to have been important sources of cotton textiles at an early<br />  date. Example kalingam means textile in tamil It was perhaps <br />because of<br />  the region's dominance of the early textile exports to Southeast <br />Asia<br />  that the term "Kling" was widely adopted in the Indonesian <br />archipelago<br />  as a blanket-term covering all South Asians, and in some cases all<br />  foreigners from the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>  The tenth-eleventh century shift in focus of the merchant <br />associations<br />  from the west coast of southern India towards the east, stimulated <br />by<br />  increasing trade with the Southeast Asia and China, was accompanied <br />by a<br />  broadening of the range of commodities traded. South Indian trade <br />with<br />  the Middle East had been dominated by such exports as black pepper,<br />  areca nuts and iron.</p>
<p>  (18) Iron remained a major export to the West into the thirteenth<br />  century and may have played an important role in trade with such<br />  Southeast Asian states as Java and Bali, which had few of their own <br />iron<br />  sources. However, with the expansion of merchant association <br />activities<br />  to the east coast of India, particularly in the cotton- producing <br />region<br />  stretching from northern Tamil Nadu through Karnataka to the <br />southern<br />  coast of Kalinga, cotton textiles began to gain more prominence in <br />the<br />  list of exports.</p>
<p>  Changes in the textile patterns illustrated on Javanese statuary of <br />the<br />  later tenth and eleventh centuries reflect the rapid rise in <br />popularity<br />  of Indian export cloths at this time.(19) Four original Javanese<br />  inscriptions containing lists of foreigners survive from the <br />eleventh<br />  century. They range in date from the 1020s to the 1050s. </p>
<p>  The Cane inscription of 1021 A.D.,(20) from the Brantas delta <br />region of<br />  east Java, lists foreigners from Kling, Aryya, Singhala, Pandikira,<br />  Drawida, Campa, Remen, and Kmir. The inscription of<br />  Patakan,(21) from the same district, lacks a legible date, but was<br />  commissioned in the same period and contains an identical list. </p>
<p>  The new name in these two lists, Drawida, refers to the east coast<br />  Dravidian region of Tamil Nadu, where the Cholas had overthrown the<br />  Pallavas late in the ninth century. The Cholas - who gained power <br />within<br />  southern India towards the end of the tenth century, and then <br />extended<br />  their influence into Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Laccadives by the <br />first<br />  decade of the eleventh century - had by this time joined the <br />merchants<br />  operating in the larger ports in maritime Southeast Asia. The Chola<br />  state had clearly become, by the 1020s, a major player in the <br />eastern<br />  sector of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>  Chinese records indicate that textiles gained in importance among <br />Indian<br />  exports to the East in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br />  (22) Further changes in the textiles illustrated on Javanese <br />statuary<br />  reflect the growing influence of certain densely-patterned block-<br />  printed Indian export textiles during this period.(23) By the 1040s <br />and<br />  1050s, when the Turun Hyang(24) and Garaman(25) inscriptions were<br />  written, two changes had taken place in names already contained in <br />the<br />  lists: Drawida had been replaced by Colika (Chola), and Pandikira by<br />  Karnataka. The Garaman inscription of 1053 A.D. also adds to the <br />list<br />  the name Malyala (the Malayala-speaking region of the Malabar <br />coast).</p>
<p>  By this time most of the merchants arriving from the named South <br />Asian<br />  regions, including those from southern Kalinga, were probably <br />operating<br />  from regions controlled by the Chola empire, and may well have been<br />  members of the dominant or subsidiary south Indian merchant<br />  associations. However, those residing in Javanese ports appear to <br />have<br />  been connected to the Javanese court as individuals - rather than as<br />  representatives of merchant associations - in their roles as tax <br />farmers<br />  in east Java.</p>
<p>  They appear to have operated on the same footing as local <br />merchants or<br />  those from elsewhere in Southeast Asia.(26)</p>
<p>  There appears to have been a lengthy hiatus in the writing of<br />  inscriptions in coastal regions of east Java between the middle of <br />the<br />  eleventh century, when the state of Mataram broke in half, and the <br />end<br />  of the thirteenth century. Of the two states formed from the <br />division of<br />  Mataram, the coastally-oriented Javanese state of Janggala, though<br />  active in trade, left few records on permanent materials - unlike <br />its<br />  sister state, Kadiri, in the interior. </p>
<p>  The state of Singhasari, formed in 1222 by reuniting the two halves <br />of<br />  former Mataram, also left few written remains. It was not until the<br />  Majapahit court replaced that of Singhasari in about 1292 A.D. <br />  that inscriptions were again written in any number on permanent<br />  materials - though many of these were merely reissues of earlier<br />  charters. </p>
<p>  The Balawi inscription of 1305 A.D.(27) is the only original <br />Majapahit<br />  inscription found to date that contains a list of tax- farming<br />  foreigners. The list reads as follows:</p>
<p>  "...wargga kilalan (tax-farmer group): Kling, Aryya, [.....], <br />Singhala,<br />  Karnataka, [.....], Cina (China), Campa (Champa), Mandisi (?), <br />Caremin<br />  (Ramanyadesa), Kmir (Cambodia),..."</p>
<p>  The significant addition found in this list is China, whose <br />merchants<br />  had, by the twelfth century, been encouraged by the financially- <br />pressed<br />  Chinese court to carry trade abroad - rather than sit and wait for <br />it to<br />  arrive. By the thirteenth century Chinese traders appear to have <br />begun<br />  to outnumber Indian traders in some ports, just as Chinese-style<br />  currency had already begun to displace the earlier forms of <br />indigenous<br />  currency in Java and Bali.(28) During the Mongol period at least <br />some of<br />  these Chinese merchants may have felt more comfortable operating <br />from<br />  non-Chinese ports. At the same time, the regions of India <br />represented in<br />  the legible portion of the Balawi list were those that had been <br />there<br />  from the ninth century onwards - the east-coast regions of Andhra<br />  Pradesh and Coromandel, and the west- coast Aryapura/Ayyavole <br />heartland<br />  of the dominant (though now fading) merchant association. The <br />decline of<br />  the Chola empire and the partial disruption of trade in eastern <br />waters<br />  during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries clearly <br />had<br />  not led to an abandoning of trade links between Indian ports and <br />those<br />  of maritime Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>  The Nagarakertagama,(29) a Javanese text completed around 1365 A.D.,<br />  mentions merchants and others from China, various parts of Southeast<br />  Asia, and Jambudwipa (India) - specifically from Goda (Gaur in<br />  Bengal) and Kamataka, these two regions having by then pulled away <br />from<br />  the control of the sultanate of Delhi. The continued importance of <br />the<br />  Tamil-speaking Kamataka coast, in particular, in Javanese lists of<br />  Indian traders may have had much to do with the textile trade. <br />Patterned<br />  textiles represented on thirteenth- and fourteenth- century statuary<br />  from east Java bear a very close resemblance to some of the patterns<br />  preserved on fragments of Indian export textiles of those centuries<br />  found at Egyptian sites.(30) Although some of the patterns on <br />Javanese<br />  statuary may represent local batik copies of Indian export cloths, <br />there<br />  is no doubt that Indian printed cottons were hugely popular all <br />around<br />  the Indian Ocean - and beyond - by this time. Even during this <br />century<br />  of relative trade depression in parts of maritime Southeast Asia,<br />  India's cottons found a ready market.</p>

<p>  MERCHANT ASSOCIATIONS AND MEDIEVAL TRADE IN SOUTH INDIA</p>
<p>  Merchant associations or guilds were features common to many <br />medieval<br />  economies.</p>
<p>  The major Asian trade boom of the tenth to thirteenth centuries <br />appears<br />  to have stimulated a significant restructuring of the administration <br />of<br />  trade in most major economies of Asia, North Africa and Europe. </p>
<p>  The Middle Eastern commenda-type investment contract (qirad, etc.),<br />  which had become such an important tool of commercial activity in <br />the<br />  Middle East by the tenth century, was introduced into Italian <br />seaports<br />  by the early eleventh century, thus providing a major impetus for <br />the<br />  expansion of trade in medieval Europe.</p>
<p>  (1) In China, the hang developed from a trading quarter into a <br />nearly<br />  autonomous trade association, and the organization of collective<br />  financing and management of overseas shipping ventures became<br />  increasingly complex.(2) And in southern India a series of merchant<br />  associations developed powerful networks and vertical monopolies <br />that<br />  included not only tied manufacturers but also private armies. These<br />  associations received a good deal of local political encouragement.</p>
<p>  Southern India, because its tracts of cultivated land were more<br />  dispersed and limited than those of north India, was never the locus <br />of<br />  large agrarian states. For much of the region's history, power was<br />  fairly evenly balanced between three or more medium-sized states <br />with<br />  different linguistic characters: Tamil on the southeast (Coromandel <br />or<br />  Cholamandala) coast; Malayalam along the southwest (Malabar) coast;   Telegu on the eastern (Andhra) coast north of the Tamil heartland; <br />and<br />  Kanarese on the western (now Konkan) coast to the north of the <br />Malabar<br />  region. Many of these states relied upon overseas trade to enhance <br />their<br />  limited agricultural income. The Pallavas were the first Tamil <br />rulers of<br />  real consequence. </p>
<p>  They grew in power from the mid-sixth to the mid-eighth centuries, <br />and<br />  their contacts with Southeast Asia are reflected in many of the <br />early<br />  Hindu remains of the maritime region.</p>
<p>  Pallava power began to decline in the later eighth century, and by <br />the<br />  later ninth century they had been replaced as the leading power in <br />the<br />  southeast by the Cholas. </p>
<p>  The Cholas built upon the economic networks developed by the <br />Pallavas,<br />  and expanded their links with merchant associations.</p>
<p>  Much of southern India's sea trade during the late first and early<br />  second millennia was controlled by these merchant associations, the <br />most<br />  important of which appear to have first formed in southwest India.</p>
<p>  During the eighth and ninth centuries much of southwest India's <br />trade<br />  had been directed towards the west, and a number of Muslim, Jewish,<br />  Zoroastrian and Christian merchant groups from western Asia and the<br />  Middle East had established trading enclaves on the Malabar coast. </p>
<p>  It was in this context that at least some of the early Indian <br />merchant<br />  associations began to form. The Manigramam, one of the earliest of <br />the<br />  south Indian merchant associations to appear in local records, was<br />  mentioned in the late ninth century Kottayam (Sthanu<br />  Ravi) copper plate inscriptions found near Quilon on the Malabar <br />coast.<br />  These record a contract between the local authority and a group of<br />  resident Christians from the Persian Gulf allowing them access, free <br />of<br />  certain taxes, to the fort which protected the port market, <br />apparently<br />  operated by the merchant group.(3) This merchant association appears <br />to<br />  have extended its influence to the east coast shortly afterwards,<br />  probably with political encouragement, since the Pallava rulers of <br />the<br />  southeast had maintained close relations with the Chera state of the<br />  Malabar coast.</p>
<p>  During the same period another merchant association had begun to <br />form<br />  further to the north in the western Deccan, at Aihole (called <br />Ayyavole<br />  in Kannada and Aryapura in Sanskrit) in the Chalukya heartland <br />behind<br />  the Konkan coast.(4) They were known either as the Ayyavole/Aryapura<br />  association (after their eighth or ninth century place of origin), <br />or<br />  more generally as the Ainnurruvar ("The Five Hundred"). This group<br />  rapidly became the most powerful of the merchant associations. A <br />number<br />  of other merchant groups are known to have affiliated themselves <br />with<br />  the Ayyavole, those most prominent in sea trade being the Manigramam <br />and<br />  the Nanadesi. In addition, at its height, the Ayyavole appears to <br />have<br />  occupied a dominant position in relation to at least forty-six other<br />  professional bodies, including major associations of artisans and<br />  mercenaries.(5)</p>
<p>  The trend in southern India towards merchant domination of certain<br />  crafts appears to have accelerated after the turn of the millennium,<br />  under Chola rule, with the effective creation of vertical artisan-<br />  merchant monopolies. Knock-on effects of the Asian trade boom that <br />were<br />  experienced in India included such developments in the weaving and<br />  dyeing industries as the introduction - possibly by the eleventh <br />century<br />  - of the draw loom, and of the spinning wheel by the thirteenth<br />  century.(6) Block-printed textiles, resist-dyed with indigo or<br />  mordant-dyed with madder or morinda, were exported in large <br />quantities<br />  to both the Middle East and Southeast Asia by the thirteenth <br />century.(7)<br />  On the back of this expanding manufacturing and trading base, <br />merchant<br />  groups gained a large degree of control over the non-agrarian <br />economy in<br />  southern India, assuming the role of major patrons of religious<br />  establishments, and being drawn into the collection of certain tolls <br />and<br />  taxes on behalf of the state.(8)</p>
<p>  Under Chola rule merchant associations appear to have dominated the<br />  internal and external trade of south India and parts of Sri Lanka <br />from<br />  the late ninth century to the late thirteenth century. The general<br />  Sanskrit term for such corporate trading communities was vanigrama<br />  ("community of merchants"), and more than one association appears to<br />  have used this term or a local variant in their titles: <br />  Vanigrama was taken as their title by a group of merchants mentioned <br />in<br />  a tenth-century Sri Lankan inscription,(9) and the term Manigramam <br />was a<br />  local variant.</p>
<p>  The slow decline of the Chola state had already begun before the end <br />of<br />  the twelfth century. During the thirteenth century, this decline<br />  accelerated into a collapse, as the Pandyans in the far south, the<br />  Hoysalas in Karnataka, and local chiefs in northern Tamil Nadu <br />carved up<br />  the Chola territory.(10) Zhao Rugua (Chau Ju-kua), writing in the <br />port<br />  of Quanzhou in 1225 A.D., recorded reports that the Chola state was <br />at<br />  war with its neighbours, although it was still - like several states <br />on<br />  the western Gujarati, Konkan, and Malabar coasts, and a number of <br />states<br />  on the east coast of India - an active exporter of cotton textiles.<br />(11)<br />  This impression of changing fortunes is reinforced by the three <br />early<br />  thirteenth century hoards of Chinese coins found on the coast of <br />Tamil<br />  Nadu,(12) which were probably abandoned by the mid-thirteenth <br />century<br />  due to local upheavals. The mid-thirteenth century efforts of the<br />  Kakatiyan ruler Ganapati to revive trade in the southeast Indian <br />port of<br />  Motupalli by promising greater safety and stability reflect the <br />growing<br />  turbulence in the<br />  region.(13)</p>
<p>  The remnants of the Chola state were eventually incorporated into <br />the<br />  fourteenth-century kingdom of Vijayanagar. Although foreign trade<br />  continued under Vijayanagar patronage, the broad consumer base and<br />  integrated regional economy of the later Chola period were lacking. <br />  By the fourteenth century the great merchant associations were <br />issuing<br />  fewer inscriptions, suggesting that - although these associations<br />  continued to exist into the seventeenth century - either their<br />  structures and modes of operation were changing, or their economic <br />and<br />  political power were declining. Despite these changes, individual<br />  traders on India's coasts continued to export the cotton textiles <br />and<br />  dyestuffs that were increasingly in demand both in the Middle East <br />and<br />  in maritime Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>  SOUTH INDIAN MERCHANTS MENTIONED IN JAVANESE SOURCES</p>
<p>  South Indian merchant associations appear to have begun to extend <br />their<br />  activities abroad during the ninth century. At first, despite their<br />  apparent involvement in the portage trade across the Thai peninsula <br />(see<br />  below), the main overseas trade focus of the Ayyavole and the <br />Manigramam<br />  seems to have been the western sector of the Indian Ocean and the <br />Middle<br />  East. By the tenth century, however, the Asian sea trade boom had <br />begun<br />  to draw more East and Southeast Asian trade into the Indian Ocean. </p>
<p>  The domestic and port trade activities of both of these associations<br />  spread during the tenth and eleventh centuries across the interior <br />and<br />  to the east coast regions ofTamil Nadu, Karnataka, southern Kalinga, <br />the<br />  Pandyan south and into northern Sri Lanka,(14) largely under the<br />  auspices of the expanding Chola state. The associations remained<br />  powerful along the east coast into the thirteenth century, but lost<br />  ground as the Chola state was dismembered towards the end of that<br />  century.</p>
<p>  The direct impact of the south Indian merchant associations in <br />Southeast<br />  Asia was limited both temporally and geographically, probably <br />because of<br />  the strength of competing local vested interests in trade. It is <br />also<br />  important to note that not all South Asians trading in maritime<br />  Southeast Asia during the Asian sea trade boom were clearly <br />associated<br />  with South Indian merchant groups. </p>
<p>  Although the surviving records are too fragmentary to provide a <br />clear<br />  picture of the structure of trading communities in early Malay and<br />  Sumatran states, epigraphic evidence from Java and Bali of this <br />period<br />  suggests that South Asians were present in the local ports in large<br />  enough numbers to be classified by region. </p>
<p>  These inscriptions also indicate that while the term banigrama (the<br />  Javanized version of vanigrama) was used in Javanese and Balinese <br />port<br />  texts for a time, these banigrama appear to have been rather fluid,<br />  port-based groupings that incorporated both local and foreign <br />merchants,<br />  some of whom were acting as tax farmers under licence from local <br />rulers.</p>
<p>  Javanese inscriptions are particularly rich in information about<br />  overseas trade connections. Shifts over time in the composition of <br />the<br />  lists of foreigners who were resident at ports in Java appear to <br />reflect<br />  changing patterns of trade.(15) The earliest dated original <br />inscription<br />  to contain such a list is that of Kalirungan(16) from Kedu in <br />central<br />  Java, dated 883 A.D. </p>
<p>  The list of foreign traders in this inscription includes mainland<br />  Southeast Asians from Campa (Champa), Remman (Ramanyadesa, in Mon <br />Lower<br />  Burma), and Kmira (Cambodia); the listed South Asians came from <br />Kling<br />  (Kalinga), Aryya (Aryapura/Ayyavole), Pandikira (in Kamataka), and<br />  perhaps Singhala (Sri Lanka) - although this last reading is <br />uncertain.<br />  The one surviving original inscription of the early tenth century to<br />  contain a list of foreigners - the Palebuhan charter of<br />  927 A.D., which concerns a community on the banks of the Solo river <br />near<br />  Madiun(17) - is, unfortunately, only partially legible.</p>
<p>  The names Singhala, Pandikira, and Ramman have, however, been<br />  preserved, suggesting that the composition of the lists had not <br />changed<br />  markedly in the forty-four years following the Kalirungan <br />inscription.<br />  The Indians in Javanese ports during the later ninth and early tenth<br />  centuries appear to have been drawn either from the east coast <br />districts<br />  of what are now Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and southern Orissa, or <br />from<br />  the western Konkan coastal region already dominated by the Ayyavole<br />  merchant association. These three regions remained a constant in the<br />  Javanese lists from the ninth to the fourteenth century. </p>
<p>  The two east coast regions of India - particularly that of Kalinga -<br />  appear to have been important sources of cotton textiles at an early<br />  date. Example kalingam means textile in tamil It was perhaps because <br />of<br />  the region's dominance of the early textile exports to Southeast <br />Asia<br />  that the term "Kling" was widely adopted in the Indonesian <br />archipelago<br />  as a blanket-term covering all South Asians, and in some cases all<br />  foreigners from the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>  The tenth-eleventh century shift in focus of the merchant <br />associations<br />  from the west coast of southern India towards the east, stimulated <br />by<br />  increasing trade with the Southeast Asia and China, was accompanied <br />by a<br />  broadening of the range of commodities traded. South Indian trade <br />with<br />  the Middle East had been dominated by such exports as black pepper,<br />  areca nuts and iron.</p>
<p>  (18) Iron remained a major export to the West into the thirteenth<br />  century and may have played an important role in trade with such<br />  Southeast Asian states as Java and Bali, which had few of their own <br />iron<br />  sources. However, with the expansion of merchant association <br />activities<br />  to the east coast of India, particularly in the cotton- producing <br />region<br />  stretching from northern Tamil Nadu through Karnataka to the <br />southern<br />  coast of Kalinga, cotton textiles began to gain more prominence in <br />the<br />  list of exports.</p>
<p>  Changes in the textile patterns illustrated on Javanese statuary of <br />the<br />  later tenth and eleventh centuries reflect the rapid rise in <br />popularity<br />  of Indian export cloths at this time.(19) Four original Javanese<br />  inscriptions containing lists of foreigners survive from the <br />eleventh<br />  century. They range in date from the 1020s to the 1050s. </p>
<p>  The Cane inscription of 1021 A.D.,(20) from the Brantas delta region <br />of<br />  east Java, lists foreigners from Kling, Aryya, Singhala, Pandikira,<br />  Drawida, Campa, Remen, and Kmir. The inscription of<br />  Patakan,(21) from the same district, lacks a legible date, but was<br />  commissioned in the same period and contains an identical list. </p>
<p>  The new name in these two lists, Drawida, refers to the east coast<br />  Dravidian region of Tamil Nadu, where the Cholas had overthrown the<br />  Pallavas late in the ninth century. The Cholas - who gained power <br />within<br />  southern India towards the end of the tenth century, and then <br />extended<br />  their influence into Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Laccadives by the <br />first<br />  decade of the eleventh century - had by this time joined the <br />merchants<br />  operating in the larger ports in maritime Southeast Asia. The Chola<br />  state had clearly become, by the 1020s, a major player in the <br />eastern<br />  sector of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>  Chinese records indicate that textiles gained in importance among <br />Indian<br />  exports to the East in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br />  (22) Further changes in the textiles illustrated on Javanese <br />statuary<br />  reflect the growing influence of certain densely-patterned block-<br />  printed Indian export textiles during this period.(23) By the 1040s <br />and<br />  1050s, when the Turun Hyang(24) and Garaman(25) inscriptions were<br />  written, two changes had taken place in names already contained in <br />the<br />  lists: Drawida had been replaced by Colika (Chola), and Pandikira by<br />  Karnataka. The Garaman inscription of 1053 A.D. also adds to the <br />list<br />  the name Malyala (the Malayala-speaking region of the Malabar coast<br />).</p>
<p>  By this time most of the merchants arriving from the named South <br />Asian<br />  regions, including those from southern Kalinga, were probably <br />operating<br />  from regions controlled by the Chola empire, and may well have been<br />  members of the dominant or subsidiary south Indian merchant<br />  associations. However, those residing in Javanese ports appear to <br />have<br />  been connected to the Javanese court as individuals - rather than as<br />  representatives of merchant associations - in their roles as tax <br />farmers<br />  in east Java.</p>
<p>  They appear to have operated on the same footing as local merchants <br />or<br />  those from elsewhere in Southeast Asia.(26)</p>
<p>  There appears to have been a lengthy hiatus in the writing of<br />  inscriptions in coastal regions of east Java between the middle of <br />the<br />  eleventh century, when the state of Mataram broke in half, and the <br />end<br />  of the thirteenth century. Of the two states formed from the <br />division of<br />  Mataram, the coastally-oriented Javanese state of Janggala, though<br />  active in trade, left few records on permanent materials - unlike <br />its<br />  sister state, Kadiri, in the interior. </p>
<p>  The state of Singhasari, formed in 1222 by reuniting the two halves <br />of<br />  former Mataram, also left few written remains. It was not until the<br />  Majapahit court replaced that of Singhasari in about 1292 A.D. <br />  that inscriptions were again written in any number on permanent<br />  materials - though many of these were merely reissues of earlier<br />  charters. </p>
<p>  The Balawi inscription of 1305 A.D.(27) is the only original <br />Majapahit<br />  inscription found to date that contains a list of tax- farming<br />  foreigners. The list reads as follows:</p>
<p>  "...wargga kilalan (tax-farmer group): Kling, Aryya, [.....], <br />Singhala,<br />  Karnataka, [.....], Cina (China), Campa (Champa), Mandisi (?), <br />Caremin<br />  (Ramanyadesa), Kmir (Cambodia),..."</p>
<p>  The significant addition found in this list is China, whose <br />merchants<br />  had, by the twelfth century, been encouraged by the financially- <br />pressed<br />  Chinese court to carry trade abroad - rather than sit and wait for <br />it to<br />  arrive. By the thirteenth century Chinese traders appear to have <br />begun<br />  to outnumber Indian traders in some ports, just as Chinese-style<br />  currency had already begun to displace the earlier forms of <br />indigenous<br />  currency in Java and Bali.(28) During the Mongol period at least <br />some of<br />  these Chinese merchants may have felt more comfortable operating <br />from<br />  non-Chinese ports. At the same time, the regions of India <br />represented in<br />  the legible portion of the Balawi list were those that had been <br />there<br />  from the ninth century onwards - the east-coast regions of Andhra<br />  Pradesh and Coromandel, and the west- coast Aryapura/Ayyavole <br />heartland<br />  of the dominant (though now fading) merchant association. The <br />decline of<br />  the Chola empire and the partial disruption of trade in eastern <br />waters<br />  during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries clearly <br />had<br />  not led to an abandoning of trade links between Indian ports and <br />those<br />  of maritime Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>  The Nagarakertagama,(29) a Javanese text completed around 1365 A.D.,<br />  mentions merchants and others from China, various parts of Southeast<br />  Asia, and Jambudwipa (India) - specifically from Goda (Gaur in<br />  Bengal) and Kamataka, these two regions having by then pulled away <br />from<br />  the control of the sultanate of Delhi. The continued importance of <br />the<br />  Tamil-speaking Kamataka coast, in particular, in Javanese lists of<br />  Indian traders may have had much to do with the textile trade. <br />Patterned<br />  textiles represented on thirteenth- and fourteenth- century statuary<br />  from east Java bear a very close resemblance to some of the patterns<br />  preserved on fragments of Indian export textiles of those centuries<br />  found at Egyptian sites.(30) Although some of the patterns on <br />Javanese<br />  statuary may represent local batik copies of Indian export cloths, <br />there<br />  is no doubt that Indian printed cottons were hugely popular all <br />around<br />  the Indian Ocean - and beyond - by this time. Even during this <br />century<br />  of relative trade depression in parts of maritime Southeast Asia,<br />  India's cottons found a ready market.</p>
