<p>MUKKURUNI VINAYAKA SHRINE</p>
<p>Possibly the most interesting photo from the collection is the one <br />of the Mukkuruni Vinayaka temple in the south-west corner of the <br />fourth prakara. The photo presents us with a gem of Early Chola <br />architecture with the West Gopuram or gateway of the Nataraja temple <br />in the background. This shrine no longer exists in this form. <br />Actually there are no structures in the temple today that can be <br />dated with any certainty to before the 12th century. The photo and <br />what it shows us represents an unexpected window on the past. The <br />shrine is shown from the south-east. It displays features typical <br />for the architecture of the Early Chola period, as well as several <br />unique and unusual features. For our analysis we follow the method <br />proposed by Dr.G.Hoekveld in her thesis Koyils in the Colamandalam. <br />[1]</p>
<p>At present the Mukkuruni Vinayaka shrine is a modern building <br />constructed of polished granite. It can be dated with all <br />probability to the late 19th century. This Vinayaka represents the <br />Trimurti. Therefore this shrine has three stupi on the top of the <br />shikharam or cupola. Mukkuruni means three (munru) times four <br />measures (kuruni). On special occasions an offer consisting of three <br />modaka made of four measures (kuruni) of rice are given as nivedya <br />or food offer. </p>
<p>The Early Chola Mukkuruni Vinayaka temple consists of the shrine's <br />garbhagriha and ardhamandapam with three pavilions or shrines added <br />at a later date.</p>
<p>The shrine can be identified as an Early Chola construction on the <br />basis of the following characteristics.<br />(1) The ground-plan and lay-out.<br />(2) The profile of the kapota.<br />(3) The shape and decoration of the kudus.<br />(4) The shape of the podigai or corbel. <br />(5) The shape and decoration of the shikhara.</p>
<p>But it also confronts us with several unique features.<br />(1) A rectangular garbhagriha and shikhara rounded off at the <br />corners and topped by three stupi.<br />(2) An ekatala building with several characteristics of a dvitala: a <br />hara with shala and karnakutis.<br />(3) The ekatala and dvitala characteristics synthesized by <br />integrating the griva niche into the hara.</p>
<p>GROUND-PLAN<br />The vimana is the part of the structure which includes the sanctum <br />or garbhagriha together with its superstructure, the sikhara. On the <br />basis of what is visible in the photo we can classify the ground-<br />plan of this vimana as belonging to the I-2-b class. [2]</p>
<p>- I indicates an ekatala or one storey building. <br />- 2 indicates a protruding section in the centre of each vimana <br />wall. <br />- b means the vimana has six pilasters in each wall. </p>
<p>The protruding section in the wall of the sanctum is clearly <br />visible. The kudus that decorate the kapota indicate the presence of <br />pilasters in the structure of the wall. Based on our observations we <br />can draw the ground plan as in this picture. The pairs of pilasters <br />that flank the central vimana niche on both sides are so close <br />together there was probably no space for additional niches besides <br />the main central niche. The space between these would most likely <br />have been a 'blind niche', a niche without sculpture.</p>
<p>The general pattern is that a shrine with six pilasters has two <br />levels or storeys, and would therefore be a dvitala. Here we have a <br />on the kapota of the roof of the ardhamandapa it can be concluded <br />the ardhamandapa walls had two pilasters each. The presence of the <br />shrine in front of the niche indicates there was a devakoshta or <br />niche with a murti or deity placed in it.</p>
<p>wall, it can be inferred this shrine would have had one niche in <br />each wall of the garbhagriha and one niche in each of the <br />ardhamandapa walls, with a total of five niches. It is not possible <br />to know which deities would have found a place in the niches of this <br />shrine. </p>
<p>LAY-OUT OF THE VIMANA AND THE ARDHAMANDAPA <br />The Mukkuruni Vinayaka temple in the photo shows an ardhamandapa <br />directly connected to the garbhagriha, but slightly narrower. A <br />faint shadow on the kapota above the first tala seen in the photo <br />indicates where and how the ardhamandapa is attached to the <br />garbhagriha. The ardhamandapa is also rather short. Maybe only half <br />the length of the visible vimana wall. With its niche being almost <br />as wide as the ardhamandapa wall itself. This is a 1-A-1 lay-out. [3]</p>
<p>- 1 indicates one niche in each vimana wall<br />- A indicates a garbhagriha directly connected to the sanctum and <br />slightly narrower.<br />- 1 indicates one niche in each wall of the ardhamandapa</p>
<p>1-A-1 temples generally belong to the older phases of construction. <br />Later temples show a straight wall with a false antarala [4] where <br />the sanctum and the porch connect. 'Koyils' shows that this lay-out <br />was applied in the period between 885-910 in the area of the Caveri <br />Delta. [5] And in South Arcot between 945-965. [6]</p>
<p>PILASTERS and PODIGAI<br />seen on the photo the podigais or corbels of the temple were angular <br />and possibly throated. This would mean they belong to the period <br />before the construction of the Rajarajesvara temple in Tanjore. T-<br />shaped podigais (for instance as the ones belonging to the mandapa <br />in front of the shrine) were applied for the first time in the <br />Rajarajesvara temple around the year 1000 CE and consequently <br />systematically applied in the construction of stone temples by Chola <br />architects. </p>
<p>KAPOTA and KUDUS<br />The kapota or cornice of the first tala is typical for all South <br />Indian temple structures. Under the Pallavas this cornice was <br />completely straight. Under the Cholas it developed a more and more <br />pronounced bell-shape. This kapota has a relatively straight profile <br />with only a very slight curve. The kudus are wide and horseshoe-<br />shaped without circles. The top of the kudus are decorated with <br />simhamukhas, also a feature of Early Chola temple architecture. </p>
<p>SHIKHARA<br />The shikhara or cupola is bulbous, ribbed, and rectangular with <br />rounded corners. [7] The bulbous profile is a typical Chola feature. <br />This sikhara is decorated with ribs. Ribbed shikharas are found on 8 <br />temples that were build in the central Caveri Delta by one of the <br />earliest Chola kings, Aditya I. These are the shrines of the (seven) <br />Sapta Sthana temples, all situated around Tanjore, and the Nagesvara <br />temple in Kumbakonam. These 8 temples are stylistically related and <br />form a core of architectural development and experiment, according <br />to Dr.Hoekveld [8]. Other temples build in the same period, that is <br />before 910 CE, have smooth shikharas. Also throughout the 10th and <br />11th century most shikharas were smooth. </p>
<p>HARA<br />A hara or roof decoration consisting of karnakutis and shalas is <br />highly unusual for an eka-tala shrine. The only other building that <br />is an ekatala with a complete hara is the Bhima Ratha in <br />Mammalapuram, as far as we have been able to establish. And only <br />very few Early Chola temples are eka-tala with karnakutis, the small <br />miniature shrines on the corner. But this hara also has a shala, a <br />rectangular pavillion at the centre of the hara. Shalas often have a <br />niche with a deity. Here this niche is very large and functions at <br />the same time as the griva niche. The deity in this niche is <br />Dakshinamurti, Shiva as a teacher, who is usually placed facing <br />south. He is flanked by rishis on both sides of the niche. This <br />combination of ekatala and dvitala, with 6 pilasters, a hara, and a <br />griva niche synthesized with the shala in this way, is unique.</p>
<p>In the karnakutis we see small sculptures of standing figures. This <br />kind of decoration is already found in early Chalukya (6th to 9th <br />century) and Pallava (6th to 9th century) temples. It is also a <br />feature of the Sapta Sthana temples, the even earlier Vijayalaya <br />Cholishvara temple in Narttamalai, the related and contemporaneous <br />Nagesvara temple in Kumbakonam, and most other dvi- and tri-tala <br />at our disposal we conclude that this feature was much less common <br />in later temples. All these points together make it entirely <br />probable to argue for a date of construction during the earliest <br />phase of Chola architectural development. </p>
<p>This is another reason to argue for an early date for the Mukkuruni <br />Vinayaka temple depicted in the photo.</p>
<p>BASE<br />Alas in the photo not enough is visible of the base to be useful for <br />analysis.</p>
<p>SECONDARY BUILDINGS<br />In the photo we can see three secondary buildings that must have <br />been added to the original shrine some time after its original <br />construction. In front of the ardhamandapam is a mukhamandapam. Its <br />base, pillars, roof and general lay-out show it to be of a much <br />later date, very possibly Later Chola. The base is decorated with a <br />lotus moulding and with sculpted panels of which we cannot see the <br />details. The pattika is shaped like a kapota with kudus. Above the <br />pattika is another layer of sculpture the details of which cannot be <br />made out. The steps leading into the mandapam and the shrine are <br />positioned on the south side of the platform in such a way devotees <br />would enter from the side and would not directly approach the deity <br />in a straight line. They are decorated with a curved railing in the <br />form of the tongue of a makara sculpted at the top of the railing. <br />The structure is reminiscent of a ratha mandapam, a hall in the form <br />of a chariot, although there is no evidence of wheels or horses. The <br />pillars are polygonal, and divided in three equal sections from <br />above the low base. The kapota has a strong curve. We would expect <br />the space under the mandapam to be dark, but it is possible to make <br />out details of the dvarapala niches. It may be that there was no <br />roof cover at the time of this photo.</p>
<p>A closed shrine has been erected in front of the southern <br />ardhamandapam niche. This indicates the deity positioned in this <br />niche was under worship and the devotees had felt the need to <br />convert the niche into a shrine. The jagati of the base base has a <br />pronounced lotus moulding, a round kumuda, and a kapota in the place <br />of the pattika. The kapota of the roof shows a reasonable pronounced <br />bell-shape. The base could be dated to the later Chola period <br />(compare for instance the base of the Airavatesvara temple in <br />Darasuram). </p>
<p>The third attached edifice is an open mandapam with possibly eight <br />pillars. It shows a base that has almost completely disappeared in <br />the surrounding pavement and the remains of a flight of steps, also <br />partly covered by the pavement. Five of the visible pillars have <br />square and polygonal mouldings. The fifth is round with a pronounced <br />kumbha. Faintly visible behind the pillars there seems to be a kind <br />of structure with mouldings. As the mandapam is open it would most <br />likely have been used to perform certain rituals, probable during <br />festivals. There may have been a small pedestal or platform for such <br />occasions. We can see it has been ritually painted with alternate <br />white and a dark color. Probably red as is the custom. This confirms <br />the concept that it was used for ritual purposes. Of the base only <br />the kapota-shaped pattika with several decorative kudus are visible. <br />Under this kapota there seem to have been sculpted panels. The <br />kapota of the roof shows a strong wave-form pointing to a relatively <br />late date. </p>
<p>elapsed between the construction of the original shrine and the <br />building of the secondary structures. The base of all three <br />structures actually points to the time of the later Cholas in the <br />12th century. They seem to be related to the ratha type structures <br />popular in that period. The curve of the kapota of the three <br />attached shrines shows a much stronger slant in comparison with the <br />kapota of the original Mukkuruni Vinayaka shrine. Compare for <br />instance the kapota of the Raja Sabha build in the first half of the <br />12th century during the reigns Vikrama Chola (1118-35) and <br />Kulottunga II (1133-50) [9]. And the kapota of the mandapam <br />originally situated in the inner prakara. It may therefore be argued <br />a considerable time elapsed between the original construction and <br />the building of the secondary shrines.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS<br />The Shri Nataraja temple is situated between the two rivers Velar <br />and Coleroon (Kollidam) near the east coast of Tamil Nadu. It is <br />situated in what are the approximate boundary areas between two <br />traditional regions, Chola Nadu and Nadu Nadu. Chola Nadu or Land of <br />the Cholas consists of the Caveri Delta. It was where the Chola <br />dynasty had its power base. Nadu Nadu means literally Central Land. <br />It consisted of the areas around modern Cuddalore and Pondicherry <br />and is now generally known as South Arcot. </p>
<p>But although Chidambaram could be considered to belong to South <br />Arcot geographically, historically it has always had strong <br />connections with the Chola dynasty. The presiding deity, Shri Shiva <br />Nataraja was the Kula Devata or family deity of the Cholas. Scenes <br />of Rajaraja Chola worshipping Shri Nataraja in Chidambaram are <br />depicted in the Rajarajesvara temple in Tanjore, build around the <br />year 1000 CE. Generally the deity of Chidambaram was held in high <br />respect by all the kings and dynasties of South India. This is <br />witnessed by the compositions of the Tevaram, by inscriptions, and <br />by legends and oral traditions. </p>
<p>It could be argued that its geographical positioning outside the <br />delta proper would disallow for an early dating, according to the <br />diffusion model as proposed by Dr.Hoeveld. But its spiritual <br />importance for the Chola kings could support the following argument. <br />Aditya I was the king who commissioned the building of the Sapta <br />Sthana temples between 872 and 885. He is known to have campaigned <br />against the Pallavas and conquered their territory during his <br />reign . He is also known to have spend considerable time at and near <br />Chidambaram and he and his son Parantaka I are the first historical <br />kings to have gilded the roof of the Cit Sabha (the sanctum <br />sanctorum of the Nataraja temple), according to inscriptions. So <br />this temple was of great personal significance to them. </p>
<p>Should it therefore surprise us if either Aditya I or Parantaka I <br />build a shrine for Vinayaka as part of the complex? Lets enumerate <br />the arguments. The shrine's ground-plan (I-2-b) and lay-out (1-A-1) <br />indicate a building date before 910 CE if we treat this temple as <br />belonging to the core-area of the Chola dynasty, the Caveri Delta. <br />The shape of its podigai points to a time of construction before <br />Rajaraja (985 CE). The ribbed shikhara and karnakuti sculptures <br />connect it with the Sapta Sthana shrines and the Nagesvara temple in <br />Kumbakonam, all build by Aditya I before 886. The secondary <br />mandapams seem to have been added at a considerable later date (see <br />especially the differences in the profile of the kapotas) and can be <br />likened to architectural conventions popular in the late 11th and <br />12th century.</p>
<p>We would therefore argue it is likely this shrine was build around <br />the year 900 CE under patronage of the Chola king Aditya I. From <br />this we may conclude the following:</p>
<p>(1) The temple complex already had more or less the present lay-out, <br />structure and size at this date, around 900 CE. The positioning of <br />the shrine in this place indicates the prakara lay-out was already <br />established, as was the placement of the gopurams. The discovery of <br />the photo of this Early Chola shrine calls for a reconsideration of <br />the accepted history of the Nataraja temple in Chidambaram.</p>
<p>(2) Certain academic publications have suggested that before the <br />10th century the temple and its traditions had a completely <br />different structure and meaning. There were certain supportive <br />arguments for this position. The discovery of proof for the <br />existence of a temple that very likely was constructed during the <br />earliest phase of Chola architecture impels us to reconsider these <br />interpretations.</p>
<p>(3) This discovery supports the findings of Dr.Sharada Srinivasan. <br />[10] Her metallurgical analysis of Ananda Tandava Murtis suggests <br />some may have been crafted as early as the 9th century under <br />patronage of the Pallava dynasty. Connections between the Pallava <br />dynasty and the Chidambaram temple are also evidenced by the <br />literary tradition. </p>
