<p>PARAKESARI &amp; RAJAKESARI ::</p>
<p>Two versions by Historians : Alternatively the Heir - apparents were Ruling <br />Chozha Kings were adopting (given) this title :: Parakesari :: Sundara; RK :: <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym ; <acronym title="Parthiban Kanavu" PK</acronym  : <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym .</p>
<p>But Sundara was <acronym title="Parthiban Kanavu" PK</acronym ; Aditha Karikalan was also <acronym title="Parthiban Kanavu" PK</acronym . Uthama was <acronym title="Parthiban Kanavu" PK</acronym . <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  was RK.<br />However, It is named after Lion and nothing to do with beheading - <br />since "Beheading" portion do precede "Rajakesari" or "Parakesari" titles - <br />in inscriptions.</acronym></p>
<p>GOLDEN AGE :: Messages are flowing on the lines "In 900s AD, when people <br />thought World was flat ?! .. comon guys let us do ... " and things like that </p>
<p>Please read Eric Von Dunkon (Chariot of Gods etc., ) and similar ones on <br />ancient Culture &amp; History .. Construction of Pyramids etc., are classic <br />examples that we are yet to attain the perfection of the Ancient ..<br />Some one says the Somnathpur Lingam was a Maragatha Lingam without support <br />from any side, including top and bottom, just was located in the mid air <br />above by balancing gravity;</p>
<p>Similar mid-<acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym Sun God was at Konarak which was indicating the direction of <br />the Sun through out the day / night.</acronym></p>
<p>Sthapathis were aware of GROWING Stones and made Bulls (Nandhi's) out of <br />them - and though they made small Nandhis thousand years back, they are big <br />now;</p>
<p>Several Siddhis - like Rasavadham - cloning etc., were practiced in Ancient <br />days...</p>
<p>Such people who were aware of such great things were GURUs and the Kings had <br />such Gurus and guided their countrys to Glory.</p>
<p>India was invaded because of its Glory ..</p>
<p>anbudan, sps</p>
<p>Like Oils to the Arabs, Infotech is also an asset to India ..</p>
<p>We will march towards the Glory .. and bring back Golden age..</p></acronym></p>

<p>The burden of proof lies on us. Sure we can believe anything we want, </p>
<blockquote><p>  but to convince people we have GOT to have proof. Anyway, like you said, <br />  these are two varying views and this might not be the forum to go into <br />this <br />  :) Although I think the members of this forum wont mind if we carried <br />this <br />  on *grin*<br />====================================================</p></blockquote>
<p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>Inspite of your hectic work, I am suprised you are able to catch with the <br />mail flow and record your punches ... Interesting...</p>
<p>The Link provided by Satish described in simple clippings - certain old <br />Egyptian engravings (about 5000 yr old) related to various flying <br />machines. The site also provided the corresponding photos of recent <br />versions - used in the past 30 / 40 yrs .. against each such item..</p>
<p>It also speaks of Hidden / Secret books of Un-named 9 during Emperor <br />Ashoka's period ... Very much interesting ..</p>
<p>Also I happen to read that the Indian investment in UK is improving and <br />that our countrymen are able to prove their skills and abilities in <br />manufacturing and management sectors .. Nice to hear that ..</p>
<p>Dear Arun,</p>
<p>Hope you did see the link provided by Satish. </p>
<p>Recent finds reported in the media confirm that most back-dated pre-<br />Historic Human (upto recent finds) should have hailed from China / Tibet <br />Sector ...</p>
<p>Summarising from whatever we have read through various sources, we can <br />arrive that the ancient Civilisations - particularly in the East and Egypt -<br />were Scholarly and mysteric. </p>
<p>The treasures of their knowledge are hidden - due to Time or by some <br />process .. Evidences are there .. we have to trace and connect them ..</p>
<p>We are lucky to witness the Best of the Scientific Developments during our <br />lifetime which opportunity was not there to our grand / great grand-<br />fathers .. ! Atleast they did not / could not SMS / e-mail to their loved <br />ones ... !</p>
<p>Evolution returned ... for Good, let us suppose.</p>
<p>fondly, sps</p>

        <p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>That argument was very similar to George W. Bush? viz, there is NO proof <br />that Iraq does NOT have WMD and hence they must have WMD. That is circuitous <br />logic. The burden of proof lies on us. Sure we can believe anything we want, <br />but to convince people we have GOT to have proof. Anyway, like you said, <br />these are two varying views and this might not be the forum to go into this <br />:) Although I think the members of this forum wont mind if we carried this <br />on *grin*</p>

        <p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>You got me wrong. I never said that our ancestors were?t great. At the same <br />time I am against attributing most/all scientific advances/knowledge to the <br />ancients. Sure they were good engineers and like I said their mathematical <br />skills were very advanced but I am against the ?? Oh Arjuna used the <br />Brahmastra which could cause universal destruction and hence we can conclude <br />that the ancients knew about nuclear weapons since the Brahmastra really was <br />a nuke ? Hope you see where I am coming from. </p>
<p>As to your point regarding the periya kovil, I agree. It is amazing to think <br />that they built that over a 1000 years ago without the help of modern <br />architectural equipment. Simply amazing.</p>

<p>=========================================</p>
<p>Dear Satish, That is a very good link you have provided. Thanks.</p>
<p>Dear Arun, </p>
<p>It is very clear that our forefathers were well aware of (1) flying <br />themselves (2) Using a Machine to fly (3) capable of increasing / <br />reducing their figures instantaneously (4) capable of entering into <br />other bodies and ... similar such things ...</p>
<p>We have read of speed of light .. 300000 km/sec. Mass travelling <br />more than the speed of light... Means we can see the Mass before <br />they start their voyage .. Unbelievable .. yet Science..</p>
<p>We are also aware of the definition that growth is "towards decay".. <br />We do not harp that our forefathers were too good and we are <br />useless.. or vice-versa ..</p>
<p>Who can think of witnessing Cricket matches alive .. till we saw in <br />TV.. less than 50 yrs span ... </p>
<p>But we refuse to recognise the Learned ones having such powers in the <br />past ..</p>
<p>Ramakrishna Paramahamsa agreed to show God to Naren .. when the event <br />occured, Naren realised he was un-prepared ...</p>
<p>Last Summer when I visited Dakshineswarar / Kolkatta, the question <br />that haunted me was :: DID THIS KALI REALLY COME ALIVE IN FRONT OF <br />RAMAKRISHNA PARAMAHAMSA .. ?</p>
<p>I did not want to say YES to myself ... <br />My rationale does not accept it .. <br />Because science taught me that Stone is lifeless .. Like you believe <br />that Lord Hanuman could not jump across Palk Straits ..</p>
<p>No offense AK,</p>
<p>best regards / sps</p>
<p></p>

        <p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>Don't compare always. Don't counter, that only by comparing we can improve.</p>
<p>it is not advisable to compare greats. There are people who are great even today. Butt he thing is that the greatness would not be accepted when the person is alive. Only when he is no more people realise any person's contribution.</p>
<p>When Bharathiyar was alive, he was called as "Paithiyam". My Grandfather who had seen Bharathiyar in the streets of Thiruvallikeni, used to say so. Now we call him Maha purushan and all those things and the poor fellow's funeral was attended only by a handful of people. </p>
<p>So don't come to a conclusion every now and then , saying today's world is not as good as what it used to be sometime back.</p>
<p>Also whatever Mahaperiyava said may not be true always. It is said that He did not want to meet a widowed mother of a devotee , because it was considered inauspicious to meet a widow( this is hearsay only, not sure how fat it is true)</p>
<p>With Regards</p>

<p>We have mention about pushpaka vimanam in Ramayanam, but we civilized <br />people think its fiction. Somebody said after 100 years people will <br />say that, people in 2005 were great. Yes thats for sure,because human <br />race is detoriating day by day. Today 1000 AD (<acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's era) is golden, <br />in 3000, 2005 will be golden.I would say even a decade makes a lot of <br />difference. 19th Century gave great poets like Barathiyar and great <br />writers like Kalki. Can we compare anyone of todays writers or poets <br />with them? As maha Periyava of kanchi said, as Technology advances, <br />humanity detoriates.</acronym></p>

<p>    I had read about 4-5 of Erich von Deniken's books quite a while<br />  back.<br />    INcidentally I think he is thought of as some sort of a crackpot by<br />  the<br />    intelligentia in the US. I think Carl Sagan wrote some sort of<br />  refutation of<br />    his ideas. Also, there was this other gentleman called Velikovsky<br />  who<br />    claimed that the "parting of the red sea" mentioned in the Bible<br />  occured<br />    because Venus, which was supposedly a part of Jupiter, was torn<br />  apart and<br />    made its way past earth to an inner orbit. Carl Sagan also refuted<br />  his<br />    claims.</p>

<p>PARAKESARI &amp; RAJAKESARI ::</p>
<p>Two versions by Historians : Alternatively the Heir - apparents were Ruling <br />Chozha Kings were adopting (given) this title :: Parakesari :: Sundara; RK :: <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym ; <acronym title="Parthiban Kanavu" PK</acronym  : <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym .</p>
<p>But Sundara was <acronym title="Parthiban Kanavu" PK</acronym ; Aditha Karikalan was also <acronym title="Parthiban Kanavu" PK</acronym . Uthama was <acronym title="Parthiban Kanavu" PK</acronym . <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  was RK.<br />However, It is named after Lion and nothing to do with beheading - <br />since "Beheading" portion do precede "Rajakesari" or "Parakesari" titles - <br />in inscriptions.</acronym></p>
<p>GOLDEN AGE :: Messages are flowing on the lines "In 900s AD, when people <br />thought World was flat ?! .. comon guys let us do ... " and things like that </p>
<p>Please read Eric Von Dunkon (Chariot of Gods etc., ) and similar ones on <br />ancient Culture &amp; History .. Construction of Pyramids etc., are classic <br />examples that we are yet to attain the perfection of the Ancient ..<br />Some one says the Somnathpur Lingam was a Maragatha Lingam without support <br />from any side, including top and bottom, just was located in the mid air <br />above by balancing gravity;</p>
<p>Similar mid-<acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym Sun God was at Konarak which was indicating the direction of <br />the Sun through out the day / night.</acronym></p>
<p>Sthapathis were aware of GROWING Stones and made Bulls (Nandhi's) out of <br />them - and though they made small Nandhis thousand years back, they are big <br />now;</p>
<p>Several Siddhis - like Rasavadham - cloning etc., were practiced in Ancient <br />days...</p>
<p>Such people who were aware of such great things were GURUs and the Kings had <br />such Gurus and guided their countrys to Glory.</p>
<p>India was invaded because of its Glory ..</p>
<p>anbudan, sps</p>
<p>Like Oils to the Arabs, Infotech is also an asset to India ..</p>
<p>We will march towards the Glory .. and bring back Golden age..</p>

          GOLDEN AGE :: INDIA        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear SPS,</p>
<p>I had read about 4-5 of Erich von Deniken's books quite a while back. <br />INcidentally I think he is thought of as some sort of a crackpot by the <br />intelligentia in the US. I think Carl Sagan wrote some sort of refutation of <br />his ideas. Also, there was this other gentleman called Velikovsky who <br />claimed that the "parting of the red sea" mentioned in the Bible occured <br />because Venus, which was supposedly a part of Jupiter, was torn apart and <br />made its way past earth to an inner orbit. Carl Sagan also refuted his <br />claims.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Arun</p>
