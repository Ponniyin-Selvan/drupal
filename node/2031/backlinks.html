</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Satish,<br />Civility and Nobleness are individual qualities....<br />I stopped argueing and commenting because I knew I was hitting my head against a brick wall I didnt want to hurt myself...</p>
<p>You can think of me as any state's Governer you fancy But I think an apology is inorder for a statement like that...</p>
<p>What you believe in is your birth right and mine !!<br />Like kamal said lets agree to disagree...But dragging families may be permitted in other groups but not in this group </p>
<p>I have cited a conersation in a different group earlier and warned that we shouldnt get to that state....</p>
<p>As far all the Christian and Muslim and Other members of this group I really admire them for their silence and resilience....</p>
<p>I remember a member stating That but for Periyar and Dravida Iyakkam he would not be chatting in the internet with all the education he has.....I dont Know if he's still a member....</p>
<p>Misqouting someone who created the word Harijan Children of God and statting he practices Untouchability and Casteism I am not argueing....</p>
<p>Bringing family and personal insults is like cheap political gimmicks!!!</p>
<p>I thank Veena for showing a sensible restraint!!!</p>
<p>I am happy that all this mudslinging has brought out queit a lot of our members to counter and advice rightly to stop this silly banter</p>
<p>I am chasing an answer to Where does the Religious Fanaticism stop....</p>
<p>I ll cite an example from PS In the days of Saivite Vaishnavite Potti....There was a Vaishnavite who was going next to Thiruvanaikaval temple and a crow pushed a bit of rock from the stone on the Vaishnavar who started to bleed    <br />His response was Srirangathu Veeravaishnava Kaakaiye intha Sivan koyilai nandraga odithu Thallu.....<br />Thats where religious fanaticism will stop!!!</p>
<p>I would be sorry to loose a good member and a intense active knowledgable person but Satish personal insults do not figure in this group.....</p>
<p>We have lost lots of active members due to these sort of badgering.....I think its the groups loss for one individuals belief and pedanticity</p>
<p>I would be grateful if you could show some civilty and retract your statement to Veena....</p>
<p>I did not censure when Priya went on about eating beef ...I did not censure when some of us were being quoted as religious illeterate....</p>
<p>But dragging someone's mother in a stupid arguement is something I will not permitt as a Hindu I dont know what you ..</p>
<p>If you choose not apologise then I am resigning as a moderator or may be even leave this group!!!</p>
<p>I am sorry but you guys have forced me to do this</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Sri</p>

<blockquote><p>  As I said, I did not want to continue on the ongoing<br />  topic anymore, <br />  and restrained from doing so yesterday. But I am<br />  human....</p>
<p>  Dear Ms.Fact Finder Veena,</p>
<p>  The things I told about RSS were published in the<br />  issues of Tuqlaq in <br />  early January, with photos, interviews with NGOs,<br />  Victims and even <br />  govt. officers who dont want them to be named etc.<br />  If you say Cho <br />  publishes nonsense in Tuqlaq, the whole group,<br />  rather the whole world <br />  will laugh at you. </p>
<p>  Likewise I can counter all your points with facts,<br />  but that will not <br />  solve the purpose, becuase its easy to wake up a<br />  sleeping person, but <br />  impossible to wake up a person acting as if asleep.</p>
<p>  Being in the US(I assume so) you might be a genius,<br />  but I(rather all) <br />  too have an iota of commonsense and a bit of<br />  knowledge. I think you <br />  belong to the category(like the politicians) who<br />  think that if we <br />  talk harsh and stubborn, whatever you talk will<br />  become truth.</p>
<p>  Good that you go only by facts. Hope your mother<br />  proved that so and <br />  so is your father with the help of a DNA test,<br />  because you would not <br />  belive things, you will only go by facts. Extremely<br />  sorry for being <br />  harsh, but you instigated. No child will question<br />  his/her mother, <br />  when she says, so and so is your father, including<br />  me. Likewise <br />  Hinduism is there from time immemorial and<br />  questioning is like <br />  questioning the existence of God itself. Sorry once<br />  again for being <br />  harsh. I never mean it.And again I dont want to get<br />  into the loop <br />  again.</p>
<p>  I dont blame you for asking for facts. Thats good<br />  indeed. Sampath, <br />  myself tried to prove our points with lots of facts<br />  and valid points. <br />  Those who opposed never accepted and we too dont<br />  force you too.<br />  But the irony is those who opposed never gave valid<br />  facts to <br />  substantiate their points. All were talking only<br />  about things they <br />  believed.</p>
<p>  All started with you commenting on the Hindu org.<br />  and I asking for <br />  the facts. But till date, inspite of me asking for<br />  the facts from you <br />  for the past one week,four or five times, you never<br />  gave me the <br />  facts. I am still waiting for the facts from you for<br />  the list of <br />  mosques demolished by Hindu orgs. because you are<br />  preaching which I <br />  expect you to practice. Preaching is easy,<br />  practicing is difficult.</p>
<p>  When you demand facts from me, which I try to<br />  produce, I too have the <br />  right to demand the same from you. Hope you will<br />  come up with the <br />  facts soon. And I will be reminding you for that on<br />  and off.</p>
<p>  Dear Sri, As a moderator I hope you wont be like the<br />  Jharkand <br />  Governor and condemn me alone. </p>
<p>  I AM NOT READY TO ARGUE ON THIS ANYMORE.LET ME PUT A<br />  FULL STOP. BUT I <br />  WILL NOT LEAVE VEENA TILL SHE FURNISHES THE FACTS<br />  FOR HER ALLEGATIONS.<br />  AGAIN QUOTING STRAY INCIDENTS DO NOT MEAN FACTS.<br />  1500 TEMPLES IN 20 <br />  YEARS IS NOT STRAY BUT 1 MOSQUE IN 1000 YEARS IS<br />  DEFINITELY STRAY. </p>
<p>  If Veena again says that destruction is not answer<br />  for destruction <br />  which we all accept, I recommend her to read Swami<br />  Vivekananda's <br />  topics on Karma Yoga.</p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Satish</p>

<p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>I didnt check my mails for the past few days and did only now. Was <br />really shocked. I think the very next statement in my mail was an <br />open apology, not once but twice. If thats not enough, I dont have <br />any reservations to ask for an open apology.</p>
<p>Veena and others, if I have crossed my limts, kodanu kodi <br />namaskarangaludan, en mannaipai kettu kolkiren.</p>
<p>Sri,</p>
<p>I appreciate you as a moderator. My character is, I never feel bad to <br />accept the mistakes and never feel bad to protest for what is wrong. <br />When something goes wrong, I am the first to protest. As in this <br />case, this nature of mine has earned me only wrong name right from my <br />shcool days, but i never regreted that. Incidently, I am reading <br />vivekandas karma yoga and I fell very happy to read that its a humans <br />duty to fight against the adharma. So I never leave a chance to fight <br />when something goes wrong. If thats not acceptable to others, I dont <br />feel bad to apologies, like I have did now.</p>
<p>But I assure you I am not a coward to run away from such incidents. <br />If you push me out, thats your right to do so. I am not going to <br />loose anything.</p>
<p>Anyway, once again my heartfelt apologies to one and all.</p>
<p>Satish<br />PS: again I have not read any other mails further and thought will <br />reply this immediately. If any mails had followed on the same thread, <br />I like to say that this mail stands as a reply to those mails also.</p>

<p>    As I said, I did not want to continue on the ongoing<br />    topic anymore, <br />    and restrained from doing so yesterday. But I am<br />    human....</p>
<p>    Dear Ms.Fact Finder Veena,</p>
<p>    The things I told about RSS were published in the<br />    issues of Tuqlaq in <br />    early January, with photos, interviews with NGOs,<br />    Victims and even <br />    govt. officers who dont want them to be named etc.<br />    If you say Cho <br />    publishes nonsense in Tuqlaq, the whole group,<br />    rather the whole world <br />    will laugh at you. </p>
<p>    Likewise I can counter all your points with facts,<br />    but that will not <br />    solve the purpose, becuase its easy to wake up a<br />    sleeping person, but <br />    impossible to wake up a person acting as if asleep.</p>
<p>    Being in the US(I assume so) you might be a genius,<br />    but I(rather all) <br />    too have an iota of commonsense and a bit of<br />    knowledge. I think you <br />    belong to the category(like the politicians) who<br />    think that if we <br />    talk harsh and stubborn, whatever you talk will<br />    become truth.</p>
<p>    Good that you go only by facts. Hope your mother<br />    proved that so and <br />    so is your father with the help of a DNA test,<br />    because you would not <br />    belive things, you will only go by facts. Extremely<br />    sorry for being <br />    harsh, but you instigated. No child will question<br />    his/her mother, <br />    when she says, so and so is your father, including<br />    me. Likewise <br />    Hinduism is there from time immemorial and<br />    questioning is like <br />    questioning the existence of God itself. Sorry once<br />    again for being <br />    harsh. I never mean it.And again I dont want to get<br />    into the loop <br />    again.</p>
<p>    I dont blame you for asking for facts. Thats good<br />    indeed. Sampath, <br />    myself tried to prove our points with lots of facts<br />    and valid points. <br />    Those who opposed never accepted and we too dont<br />    force you too.<br />    But the irony is those who opposed never gave valid<br />    facts to <br />    substantiate their points. All were talking only<br />    about things they <br />    believed.</p>
<p>    All started with you commenting on the Hindu org.<br />    and I asking for <br />    the facts. But till date, inspite of me asking for<br />    the facts from you <br />    for the past one week,four or five times, you never<br />    gave me the <br />    facts. I am still waiting for the facts from you for<br />    the list of <br />    mosques demolished by Hindu orgs. because you are<br />    preaching which I <br />    expect you to practice. Preaching is easy,<br />    practicing is difficult.</p>
<p>    When you demand facts from me, which I try to<br />    produce, I too have the <br />    right to demand the same from you. Hope you will<br />    come up with the <br />    facts soon. And I will be reminding you for that on<br />    and off.</p>
<p>    Dear Sri, As a moderator I hope you wont be like the<br />    Jharkand <br />    Governor and condemn me alone. </p>
<p>    I AM NOT READY TO ARGUE ON THIS ANYMORE.LET ME PUT A<br />    FULL STOP. BUT I <br />    WILL NOT LEAVE VEENA TILL SHE FURNISHES THE FACTS<br />    FOR HER ALLEGATIONS.<br />    AGAIN QUOTING STRAY INCIDENTS DO NOT MEAN FACTS.<br />    1500 TEMPLES IN 20 <br />    YEARS IS NOT STRAY BUT 1 MOSQUE IN 1000 YEARS IS<br />    DEFINITELY STRAY. </p>
<p>    If Veena again says that destruction is not answer<br />    for destruction <br />    which we all accept, I recommend her to read Swami<br />    Vivekananda's <br />    topics on Karma Yoga.</p>
<p>    Regards,<br />    Satish</p>

<p>I will also be devotong an evening to explain the content of the recently publishes book by Iravatham Mahadevan on the Tamil-Brahmi and Early Vattezhuttu.</p>
<p>The Tamil Manram is also finding our idea of Cultural Atlas of Tamilnadu interesting. May be we can revive and work on it.</p>

        <p>Sampath,</p>
<p>Thanks much for your concern and kind words. But no, my feelings def <br />weren't hurt by anything that happened in this forum. If we all start <br />feeling bad listening to everyone who walks the streets(of the <br />Internet or otherwise), we will never get anything productive done!</p>
<p>You are so right in that this debate will go on everywhere. As far as <br />mankind exists there will always be conservatives and liberals and <br />there is really no way to get out of it.</p>
<p>Thanks again!<br />Veena</p>

<p>  A serious discussion went on religion and finally it came to an end <br />  with various twists and turns with bad feelings,hurt hearts and <br />  emotional sparks flying abound.Many group members who werent <br />posting <br />  for a long time asked this debate to be ended.Many felt this debate <br />  to be bad,political and something which is avoidable,taboo and so <br />on.</p>
<p>  Anyway earlier I said that I gave my last word on this and I stick <br />  to it.I am not gonna add fuel to the fire,but I see some of my <br />  friends feeling very bad about this issue-Dr.Sridhar,Veena and many <br />  others who requested this debate to end.</p>
<p>  My words to Dr.Sridhar is "Dont feel bad.You are an invaluble <br />member <br />  to this group.So dont talk about resigning and staying away.We all <br />  are brothers and misunderstnading is common in a family."</p>
<p>  My words to Veena is "I find your opinions rational and thoughtful <br />  and you debated in a very civilized manner.If you were hurt for any <br />  reasons, well dont,be cool-I know you will stay cool.In passionate <br />  debates which challenge the fundamental faith of a person-sparks <br />  will fly.You debated well."</p>
<p>  My words to other members who were fed up with this religious stuff <br />  and feel that it was useless,divisive,vithupertaive,vitriolic (I'm <br />  running out of adjectives) is as follows.</p>
<p>  This debate will not leave you.It will chase you in <br />  elections,media,friends circle,tea shop benches etc.Today our <br />  country- if not the world is divided on this right Vs. Left <br />  debate.This debate catapulted Bush to the throne for a second <br />  time,put ali-sistani in throne in iraq,threatens palestinians and <br />  israelis,divides india into NDA VS UPA,decides the future of many <br />  major industrial giants(chik-fil-A,EXXON-MOBIL) makes hollowood <br />fill <br />  its coffers (passion of christ) threatens scientists( creationism <br />vs <br />  evolution),divides judiciary(10 commandments in courts debate)and <br />  decides best seller of the year(davinci code)</p>
<p>  So no hard feelings,be happy and cool</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Santh,</p>
<p>For the most part, I am on the same side of the fence as you are here <br />but there are a couple of places where I think you succumb to some <br />generalization. Couldn't resist bringing that up.</p>
<p>First of all, this is an open forum. Whether the moderator has the <br />time to read every mail before posting is besides the point. I, for <br />one, do not think that the moderator(whoever he is) should monitor <br />posts before publishing them. The idea of free speech/expression is <br />something that this 'open' forum guarantees all of us and I agree <br />with you abt observing etiquettes but reading/curbing posts is <br />definitely not my idea of enforcing it. In ACLU terms, I'd call it a <br />First Amendment Violation :)</p>
<p>I also think you are generalizing when you say that you see this <br />trend is groups mostly involving Indians. As someone who belongs to <br />quite a few Indian / S Asian / world literature / culture groups, my <br />experience has not been quite the same. There are 'over-enthusiastic' <br />people in every group and then there are some who provide well-<br />thought of analyses, regardless of whatever culture they belong to. </p>
<p>Even if we assume for a moment that you are right abt this, how can <br />you attribute it to an overdose of convent education and a lack of <br />academic training? When did convent education had anything to do with <br />whether a person can think logically or not? (Other than the obvious <br />religious part of it ofcourse!) </p>
<p>Again, my intention is not to start another argument here. As I said, <br />I am completely with you in the need for observing etiquette and/or <br />providing cogent analyses but couldn't help thinking that you are <br />generalizing a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  too much.</p>

<p>  Introspection? Do we have to introspect when it comes to observing<br />  etiqutettes? If the objective of this group is to share a passion of<br />  history and heritage and NOT to be biased to or influenced by any<br />  idealogy, arent we supposed to observe a few ground rules? And there<br />  has to be no pleading or negotiating in observing ground rules.</p>
<p>  I have seen this trend repeatedly in groups involving Indians. They<br />  carry more passion than substance, and even the few articles that <br />hint<br />  substance is seldom supported by cogent evidence or analysis. Our<br />  enthusiasm is disproportionately large compared to the hard work we<br />  put in to seek truth. I can blame this to an overdose of convent<br />  education, too much time at the PCs without the interest to do the<br />  research, lack of proper academic training as we continue to be bad<br />  amateurs and a tendency to succumb to idealogues.</p>
<p>  One other ominous trend is you will always see a dude trying to take<br />  every discussion on any topic to hindu persecution and hindutva<br />  renaissance. He will always be angry with Alauddin Khilji for<br />  desecrating Madurai temple and will not forgive him in a million<br />  years. This fellow is also bleached with a falsification of his<br />  religion and misplaced nationalism and is emotionally misinterprets<br />  history and refuses to see both sides of the coin. He<br />  turns the discussion into a monologue, fails to listen and if you<br />  try to talk sense into him, gets vitriolic. Maybe<br />  people like him existed since Dayanand Saraswati, but they have <br />become<br />  bold and ubiquitous with the advent of internet.</p>
<p>  I'd suggest that the moderator(s) inspects every mail before they <br />get<br />  published here and keep the discussions focused, objective, and<br />  encourage people who share or seek knowledge.</p>

<p>      Sridhar,</p>
<p>      My two cents: I think in any group, esp in an online one, <br />people tend <br />      to get carried away, get more than a little emotional and start <br />      taking things personally. I do agree with you that sometimes, <br />it <br />      crosses limits and gets into dangerous territory but please do <br />not <br />      think about resigning as moderator/or from the group as a <br />result of <br />      silly rantings from any of us. Its not worth it!</p>
<p>      Thanks,<br />      Veena </p>

<p>        You can think of me as any state's Governer you fancy But I <br />think <br />      an apology is inorder for a statement like that...</p>
<p>        What you believe in is your birth right and mine !!<br />        Like kamal said lets agree to disagree...But dragging <br />families may <br />      be permitted in other groups but not in this group </p>
<p>        I have cited a conersation in a different group earlier and <br />warned <br />      that we shouldnt get to that state....</p>
<p>        As far all the Christian and Muslim and Other members of this <br />group <br />      I really admire them for their silence and resilience....</p>
<p>        I remember a member stating That but for Periyar and Dravida <br />      Iyakkam he would not be chatting in the internet with all the <br />      education he has.....I dont Know if he's still a member....</p>
<p>        Misqouting someone who created the word Harijan Children of <br />God and <br />      statting he practices Untouchability and Casteism I am not <br />      argueing....</p>
<p>        Bringing family and personal insults is like cheap political <br />      gimmicks!!!</p>
<p>        I thank Veena for showing a sensible restraint!!!</p>
<p>        I am happy that all this mudslinging has brought out queit a <br />lot of <br />      our members to counter and advice rightly to stop this silly <br />banter</p>
<p>        I am chasing an answer to Where does the Religious Fanaticism <br />      stop....</p>
<p>        I ll cite an example from PS In the days of Saivite <br />Vaishnavite <br />      Potti....There was a Vaishnavite who was going next to <br />      Thiruvanaikaval temple and a crow pushed a bit of rock from the <br />stone <br />      on the Vaishnavar who started to bleed    <br />        His response was Srirangathu Veeravaishnava Kaakaiye intha <br />Sivan <br />      koyilai nandraga odithu Thallu.....<br />        Thats where religious fanaticism will stop!!!</p>
<p>        I would be sorry to loose a good member and a intense active <br />      knowledgable person but Satish personal insults do not figure <br />in this <br />      group.....</p>
<p>        We have lost lots of active members due to these sort of <br />      badgering.....I think its the groups loss for one individuals <br />belief <br />      and pedanticity</p>
<p>        I would be grateful if you could show some civilty and <br />retract your <br />      statement to Veena....</p>
<p>        I did not censure when Priya went on about eating beef ...I <br />did not <br />      censure when some of us were being quoted as religious <br />illeterate....</p>
<p>        But dragging someone's mother in a stupid arguement is <br />something I <br />      will not permitt as a Hindu I dont know what you ..</p>
<p>        If you choose not apologise then I am resigning as a <br />moderator or <br />      may be even leave this group!!!</p>
<p>        I am sorry but you guys have forced me to do this</p>
<p>        Regards</p>

<p>          As I said, I did not want to continue on the ongoing<br />          topic anymore, <br />          and restrained from doing so yesterday. But I am<br />          human....</p>
<p>          Dear Ms.Fact Finder Veena,</p>
<p>          The things I told about RSS were published in the<br />          issues of Tuqlaq in <br />          early January, with photos, interviews with NGOs,<br />          Victims and even <br />          govt. officers who dont want them to be named etc.<br />          If you say Cho <br />          publishes nonsense in Tuqlaq, the whole group,<br />          rather the whole world <br />          will laugh at you. </p>
<p>          Likewise I can counter all your points with facts,<br />          but that will not <br />          solve the purpose, becuase its easy to wake up a<br />          sleeping person, but <br />          impossible to wake up a person acting as if asleep.</p>
<p>          Being in the US(I assume so) you might be a genius,<br />          but I(rather all) <br />          too have an iota of commonsense and a bit of<br />          knowledge. I think you <br />          belong to the category(like the politicians) who<br />          think that if we <br />          talk harsh and stubborn, whatever you talk will<br />          become truth.</p>
<p>          Good that you go only by facts. Hope your mother<br />          proved that so and <br />          so is your father with the help of a DNA test,<br />          because you would not <br />          belive things, you will only go by facts. Extremely<br />          sorry for being <br />          harsh, but you instigated. No child will question<br />          his/her mother, <br />          when she says, so and so is your father, including<br />          me. Likewise <br />          Hinduism is there from time immemorial and<br />          questioning is like <br />          questioning the existence of God itself. Sorry once<br />          again for being <br />          harsh. I never mean it.And again I dont want to get<br />          into the loop <br />          again.</p>
<p>          I dont blame you for asking for facts. Thats good<br />          indeed. Sampath, <br />          myself tried to prove our points with lots of facts<br />          and valid points. <br />          Those who opposed never accepted and we too dont<br />          force you too.<br />          But the irony is those who opposed never gave valid<br />          facts to <br />          substantiate their points. All were talking only<br />          about things they <br />          believed.</p>
<p>          All started with you commenting on the Hindu org.<br />          and I asking for <br />          the facts. But till date, inspite of me asking for<br />          the facts from you <br />          for the past one week,four or five times, you never<br />          gave me the <br />          facts. I am still waiting for the facts from you for<br />          the list of <br />          mosques demolished by Hindu orgs. because you are<br />          preaching which I <br />          expect you to practice. Preaching is easy,<br />          practicing is difficult.</p>
<p>          When you demand facts from me, which I try to<br />          produce, I too have the <br />          right to demand the same from you. Hope you will<br />          come up with the <br />          facts soon. And I will be reminding you for that on<br />          and off.</p>
<p>          Dear Sri, As a moderator I hope you wont be like the<br />          Jharkand <br />          Governor and condemn me alone. </p>
<p>          I AM NOT READY TO ARGUE ON THIS ANYMORE.LET ME PUT A<br />          FULL STOP. BUT I <br />          WILL NOT LEAVE VEENA TILL SHE FURNISHES THE FACTS<br />          FOR HER ALLEGATIONS.<br />          AGAIN QUOTING STRAY INCIDENTS DO NOT MEAN FACTS.<br />          1500 TEMPLES IN 20 <br />          YEARS IS NOT STRAY BUT 1 MOSQUE IN 1000 YEARS IS<br />          DEFINITELY STRAY. </p>
<p>          If Veena again says that destruction is not answer<br />          for destruction <br />          which we all accept, I recommend her to read Swami<br />          Vivekananda's <br />          topics on Karma Yoga.</p>

        <p>Note: I always correct typos after I publish...</p>
<p>Introspection? Do we have to introspect when it comes to observing<br />etiqutettes? If the objective of this group is to share a passion of<br />history and heritage and NOT to be biased to or influenced by any<br />idealogy, arent we supposed to observe a few ground rules? And there<br />has to be no pleading or negotiating in observing ground rules.</p>
<p>I have seen this trend repeatedly in groups involving Indians. They<br />carry more passion than substance, and even the few articles that hint<br />substance is seldom supported by cogent evidence or analysis. Our<br />enthusiasm is disproportionately large compared to the hard work we<br />put in to seek truth. I can blame this to an overdose of convent<br />education, too much time at the PCs without the interest to do the<br />research, lack of proper academic training as we continue to be bad<br />amateurs and a tendency to succumb to idealogues.</p>
<p>One other ominous trend is you will always see a dude trying to take<br />every discussion on any topic to hindu persecution and hindutva<br />renaissance. He will always be angry with Alauddin Khilji for<br />desecrating Madurai temple and will not forgive him in a million<br />years. This fellow is also bleached with a falsification of his<br />religion and misplaced nationalism and is emotionally misinterprets<br />history and refuses to see both sides of the coin. He<br />turns the discussion into a monologue, fails to listen and if you<br />try to talk sense into him, gets vitriolic. Maybe<br />people like him existed since Dayanand Saraswati, but they have become<br />bold and ubiquitous with the advent of internet.</p>
<p>I'd suggest that the moderator(s) inspects every mail before they get<br />published here and keep the discussions focused, objective, and<br />encourage people who share or seek knowledge.</p>

<p>    Sridhar,</p>
<p>    My two cents: I think in any group, esp in an online one, people tend <br />    to get carried away, get more than a little emotional and start <br />    taking things personally. I do agree with you that sometimes, it <br />    crosses limits and gets into dangerous territory but please do not <br />    think about resigning as moderator/or from the group as a result of <br />    silly rantings from any of us. Its not worth it!</p>
<p>    Thanks,<br />    Veena </p>

<p>      You can think of me as any state's Governer you fancy But I think <br />    an apology is inorder for a statement like that...</p>
<p>      What you believe in is your birth right and mine !!<br />      Like kamal said lets agree to disagree...But dragging families may <br />    be permitted in other groups but not in this group </p>
<p>      I have cited a conersation in a different group earlier and warned <br />    that we shouldnt get to that state....</p>
<p>      As far all the Christian and Muslim and Other members of this group <br />    I really admire them for their silence and resilience....</p>
<p>      I remember a member stating That but for Periyar and Dravida <br />    Iyakkam he would not be chatting in the internet with all the <br />    education he has.....I dont Know if he's still a member....</p>
<p>      Misqouting someone who created the word Harijan Children of God and <br />    statting he practices Untouchability and Casteism I am not <br />    argueing....</p>
<p>      Bringing family and personal insults is like cheap political <br />    gimmicks!!!</p>
<p>      I thank Veena for showing a sensible restraint!!!</p>
<p>      I am happy that all this mudslinging has brought out queit a lot of <br />    our members to counter and advice rightly to stop this silly banter</p>
<p>      I am chasing an answer to Where does the Religious Fanaticism <br />    stop....</p>
<p>      I ll cite an example from PS In the days of Saivite Vaishnavite <br />    Potti....There was a Vaishnavite who was going next to <br />    Thiruvanaikaval temple and a crow pushed a bit of rock from the stone <br />    on the Vaishnavar who started to bleed    <br />      His response was Srirangathu Veeravaishnava Kaakaiye intha Sivan <br />    koyilai nandraga odithu Thallu.....<br />      Thats where religious fanaticism will stop!!!</p>
<p>      I would be sorry to loose a good member and a intense active <br />    knowledgable person but Satish personal insults do not figure in this <br />    group.....</p>
<p>      We have lost lots of active members due to these sort of <br />    badgering.....I think its the groups loss for one individuals belief <br />    and pedanticity</p>
<p>      I would be grateful if you could show some civilty and retract your <br />    statement to Veena....</p>
<p>      I did not censure when Priya went on about eating beef ...I did not <br />    censure when some of us were being quoted as religious illeterate....</p>
<p>      But dragging someone's mother in a stupid arguement is something I <br />    will not permitt as a Hindu I dont know what you ..</p>
<p>      If you choose not apologise then I am resigning as a moderator or <br />    may be even leave this group!!!</p>
<p>      I am sorry but you guys have forced me to do this</p>

<p>        As I said, I did not want to continue on the ongoing<br />        topic anymore, <br />        and restrained from doing so yesterday. But I am<br />        human....</p>
<p>        Dear Ms.Fact Finder Veena,</p>
<p>        The things I told about RSS were published in the<br />        issues of Tuqlaq in <br />        early January, with photos, interviews with NGOs,<br />        Victims and even <br />        govt. officers who dont want them to be named etc.<br />        If you say Cho <br />        publishes nonsense in Tuqlaq, the whole group,<br />        rather the whole world <br />        will laugh at you. </p>
<p>        Likewise I can counter all your points with facts,<br />        but that will not <br />        solve the purpose, becuase its easy to wake up a<br />        sleeping person, but <br />        impossible to wake up a person acting as if asleep.</p>
<p>        Being in the US(I assume so) you might be a genius,<br />        but I(rather all) <br />        too have an iota of commonsense and a bit of<br />        knowledge. I think you <br />        belong to the category(like the politicians) who<br />        think that if we <br />        talk harsh and stubborn, whatever you talk will<br />        become truth.</p>
<p>        Good that you go only by facts. Hope your mother<br />        proved that so and <br />        so is your father with the help of a DNA test,<br />        because you would not <br />        belive things, you will only go by facts. Extremely<br />        sorry for being <br />        harsh, but you instigated. No child will question<br />        his/her mother, <br />        when she says, so and so is your father, including<br />        me. Likewise <br />        Hinduism is there from time immemorial and<br />        questioning is like <br />        questioning the existence of God itself. Sorry once<br />        again for being <br />        harsh. I never mean it.And again I dont want to get<br />        into the loop <br />        again.</p>
<p>        I dont blame you for asking for facts. Thats good<br />        indeed. Sampath, <br />        myself tried to prove our points with lots of facts<br />        and valid points. <br />        Those who opposed never accepted and we too dont<br />        force you too.<br />        But the irony is those who opposed never gave valid<br />        facts to <br />        substantiate their points. All were talking only<br />        about things they <br />        believed.</p>
<p>        All started with you commenting on the Hindu org.<br />        and I asking for <br />        the facts. But till date, inspite of me asking for<br />        the facts from you <br />        for the past one week,four or five times, you never<br />        gave me the <br />        facts. I am still waiting for the facts from you for<br />        the list of <br />        mosques demolished by Hindu orgs. because you are<br />        preaching which I <br />        expect you to practice. Preaching is easy,<br />        practicing is difficult.</p>
<p>        When you demand facts from me, which I try to<br />        produce, I too have the <br />        right to demand the same from you. Hope you will<br />        come up with the <br />        facts soon. And I will be reminding you for that on<br />        and off.</p>
<p>        Dear Sri, As a moderator I hope you wont be like the<br />        Jharkand <br />        Governor and condemn me alone. </p>
<p>        I AM NOT READY TO ARGUE ON THIS ANYMORE.LET ME PUT A<br />        FULL STOP. BUT I <br />        WILL NOT LEAVE VEENA TILL SHE FURNISHES THE FACTS<br />        FOR HER ALLEGATIONS.<br />        AGAIN QUOTING STRAY INCIDENTS DO NOT MEAN FACTS.<br />        1500 TEMPLES IN 20 <br />        YEARS IS NOT STRAY BUT 1 MOSQUE IN 1000 YEARS IS<br />        DEFINITELY STRAY. </p>
<p>        If Veena again says that destruction is not answer<br />        for destruction <br />        which we all accept, I recommend her to read Swami<br />        Vivekananda's <br />        topics on Karma Yoga.</p>

        <p>Friends,</p>
<p>A serious discussion went on religion and finally it came to an end <br />with various twists and turns with bad feelings,hurt hearts and <br />emotional sparks flying abound.Many group members who werent posting <br />for a long time asked this debate to be ended.Many felt this debate <br />to be bad,political and something which is avoidable,taboo and so on.</p>
<p>Anyway earlier I said that I gave my last word on this and I stick <br />to it.I am not gonna add fuel to the fire,but I see some of my <br />friends feeling very bad about this issue-Dr.Sridhar,Veena and many <br />others who requested this debate to end.</p>
<p>My words to Dr.Sridhar is "Dont feel bad.You are an invaluble member <br />to this group.So dont talk about resigning and staying away.We all <br />are brothers and misunderstnading is common in a family."</p>
<p>My words to Veena is "I find your opinions rational and thoughtful <br />and you debated in a very civilized manner.If you were hurt for any <br />reasons, well dont,be cool-I know you will stay cool.In passionate <br />debates which challenge the fundamental faith of a person-sparks <br />will fly.You debated well."</p>
<p>My words to other members who were fed up with this religious stuff <br />and feel that it was useless,divisive,vithupertaive,vitriolic (I'm <br />running out of adjectives) is as follows.</p>
<p>This debate will not leave you.It will chase you in <br />elections,media,friends circle,tea shop benches etc.Today our <br />country- if not the world is divided on this right Vs. Left <br />debate.This debate catapulted Bush to the throne for a second <br />time,put ali-sistani in throne in iraq,threatens palestinians and <br />israelis,divides india into NDA VS UPA,decides the future of many <br />major industrial giants(chik-fil-A,EXXON-MOBIL) makes hollowood fill <br />its coffers (passion of christ) threatens scientists( creationism vs <br />evolution),divides judiciary(10 commandments in courts debate)and <br />decides best seller of the year(davinci code)</p>
<p>So no hard feelings,be happy and cool</p>
<p>regards<br />sampath</p>

        <p>Sridhar,</p>
<p>My two cents: I think in any group, esp in an online one, people tend <br />to get carried away, get more than a little emotional and start <br />taking things personally. I do agree with you that sometimes, it <br />crosses limits and gets into dangerous territory but please do not <br />think about resigning as moderator/or from the group as a result of <br />silly rantings from any of us. Its not worth it!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Veena </p>

<p>  You can think of me as any state's Governer you fancy But I think <br />an apology is inorder for a statement like that...</p>
<p>  What you believe in is your birth right and mine !!<br />  Like kamal said lets agree to disagree...But dragging families may <br />be permitted in other groups but not in this group </p>
<p>  I have cited a conersation in a different group earlier and warned <br />that we shouldnt get to that state....</p>
<p>  As far all the Christian and Muslim and Other members of this group <br />I really admire them for their silence and resilience....</p>
<p>  I remember a member stating That but for Periyar and Dravida <br />Iyakkam he would not be chatting in the internet with all the </p></blockquote>
<p>education he has.....I dont Know if he's still a member....</p>
<blockquote><p>  Misqouting someone who created the word Harijan Children of God and <br />statting he practices Untouchability and Casteism I am not </p></blockquote>
<p>argueing....</p>
<blockquote><p>  Bringing family and personal insults is like cheap political <br />gimmicks!!!</p>
<p>  I thank Veena for showing a sensible restraint!!!</p>
<p>  I am happy that all this mudslinging has brought out queit a lot of <br />our members to counter and advice rightly to stop this silly banter</p>
<p>  I am chasing an answer to Where does the Religious Fanaticism <br />stop....</p>
<p>  I ll cite an example from PS In the days of Saivite Vaishnavite <br />Potti....There was a Vaishnavite who was going next to </p></blockquote>
<p>Thiruvanaikaval temple and a crow pushed a bit of rock from the stone <br />on the Vaishnavar who started to bleed    </p>
<blockquote><p>  His response was Srirangathu Veeravaishnava Kaakaiye intha Sivan <br />koyilai nandraga odithu Thallu.....<br />  Thats where religious fanaticism will stop!!!</p>
<p>  I would be sorry to loose a good member and a intense active <br />knowledgable person but Satish personal insults do not figure in this </p></blockquote>
<p>group.....</p>
<blockquote><p>  We have lost lots of active members due to these sort of <br />badgering.....I think its the groups loss for one individuals belief </p></blockquote>
<p>and pedanticity</p>
<blockquote><p>  I would be grateful if you could show some civilty and retract your <br />statement to Veena....</p>
<p>  I did not censure when Priya went on about eating beef ...I did not <br />censure when some of us were being quoted as religious illeterate....</p>
<p>  But dragging someone's mother in a stupid arguement is something I <br />will not permitt as a Hindu I dont know what you ..</p>
<p>  If you choose not apologise then I am resigning as a moderator or <br />may be even leave this group!!!</p>
<p>  I am sorry but you guys have forced me to do this</p>

<p>    As I said, I did not want to continue on the ongoing<br />    topic anymore, <br />    and restrained from doing so yesterday. But I am<br />    human....</p>
<p>    Dear Ms.Fact Finder Veena,</p>
<p>    The things I told about RSS were published in the<br />    issues of Tuqlaq in <br />    early January, with photos, interviews with NGOs,<br />    Victims and even <br />    govt. officers who dont want them to be named etc.<br />    If you say Cho <br />    publishes nonsense in Tuqlaq, the whole group,<br />    rather the whole world <br />    will laugh at you. </p>
<p>    Likewise I can counter all your points with facts,<br />    but that will not <br />    solve the purpose, becuase its easy to wake up a<br />    sleeping person, but <br />    impossible to wake up a person acting as if asleep.</p>
<p>    Being in the US(I assume so) you might be a genius,<br />    but I(rather all) <br />    too have an iota of commonsense and a bit of<br />    knowledge. I think you <br />    belong to the category(like the politicians) who<br />    think that if we <br />    talk harsh and stubborn, whatever you talk will<br />    become truth.</p>
<p>    Good that you go only by facts. Hope your mother<br />    proved that so and <br />    so is your father with the help of a DNA test,<br />    because you would not <br />    belive things, you will only go by facts. Extremely<br />    sorry for being <br />    harsh, but you instigated. No child will question<br />    his/her mother, <br />    when she says, so and so is your father, including<br />    me. Likewise <br />    Hinduism is there from time immemorial and<br />    questioning is like <br />    questioning the existence of God itself. Sorry once<br />    again for being <br />    harsh. I never mean it.And again I dont want to get<br />    into the loop <br />    again.</p>
<p>    I dont blame you for asking for facts. Thats good<br />    indeed. Sampath, <br />    myself tried to prove our points with lots of facts<br />    and valid points. <br />    Those who opposed never accepted and we too dont<br />    force you too.<br />    But the irony is those who opposed never gave valid<br />    facts to <br />    substantiate their points. All were talking only<br />    about things they <br />    believed.</p>
<p>    All started with you commenting on the Hindu org.<br />    and I asking for <br />    the facts. But till date, inspite of me asking for<br />    the facts from you <br />    for the past one week,four or five times, you never<br />    gave me the <br />    facts. I am still waiting for the facts from you for<br />    the list of <br />    mosques demolished by Hindu orgs. because you are<br />    preaching which I <br />    expect you to practice. Preaching is easy,<br />    practicing is difficult.</p>
<p>    When you demand facts from me, which I try to<br />    produce, I too have the <br />    right to demand the same from you. Hope you will<br />    come up with the <br />    facts soon. And I will be reminding you for that on<br />    and off.</p>
<p>    Dear Sri, As a moderator I hope you wont be like the<br />    Jharkand <br />    Governor and condemn me alone. </p>
<p>    I AM NOT READY TO ARGUE ON THIS ANYMORE.LET ME PUT A<br />    FULL STOP. BUT I <br />    WILL NOT LEAVE VEENA TILL SHE FURNISHES THE FACTS<br />    FOR HER ALLEGATIONS.<br />    AGAIN QUOTING STRAY INCIDENTS DO NOT MEAN FACTS.<br />    1500 TEMPLES IN 20 <br />    YEARS IS NOT STRAY BUT 1 MOSQUE IN 1000 YEARS IS<br />    DEFINITELY STRAY. </p>
<p>    If Veena again says that destruction is not answer<br />    for destruction <br />    which we all accept, I recommend her to read Swami<br />    Vivekananda's <br />    topics on Karma Yoga.</p>
