<p>      As much as I trust and believe in Rama and Ramayana, I do not <br />    believe in the Ramar palam proclaimed as now the original. I <br />  believe <br />    the real Lanka during the Ravana time is under water. This may <br />  sound <br />    blasphemous to many who hear, but I believe the currentl Lanka <br />was <br />    also a part of the Bharatha Maha kandam as to thousands of <br />  centuries <br />    ago. <br />      The lanka taked by Ramayana is a harcode island, far off <br />from <br />    the tip of southern India. </p>
<p>      Why I believe so...</p>
<p>      Lanka, Ravana's land, viewable only by Sampati from the <br />  mountain <br />    top. Even angada who can jump 2000 yojanas would not be able to <br />    reach the island and it was possible only by Maruthi who could <br />do <br />    atleast 8000 yojanas in one leap. Going by this standard alone, <br />    either the land mass between the ends where the monkey's stood <br />and <br />    Lanka is totally not visible. I am sure people who have visited <br />    Danush kodi will feel other wise on the view part.</p>
<p>      A cue to be taken from Thirupugazh, in a song about Kathir <br />  Kamam<br />    (which belonged to a part of the Skanda territory hence the <br />great <br />    temples of Kandi and Kathir kamam).<br />      Uduka thugil vendum is a brilliant song about Kathirkamam.<br />      The 2nd half of verses say, Kudakku sila thuthar theduga.. <br />(go <br />    to the southern most tip until to find Her) was the command from <br />    Sugreeva, hence start forth Hanuman Angada , Jambhavan etc, <br />  Hanuman <br />    ends up finding her and burning lanka... while his return <br />journey, <br />    he takes a break at Manikka gangai and seeks the Blessing of the <br />    Lord who stands there in a formless entity (documented in <br />    Kathirkamam too) and the Lord of all battles between G vs E to <br />    prepare for the great War. </p>
<p>      After his tail was on fire and the lankan army after him, he <br />    could not have rested inside Lanka to do this bath and prayer. <br />    Defies logic. </p>
<p>      Going back into Ramayana: Ravana possesed the moola bala <br />  sainya <br />    which was the greatest demon army ever, housed under his <br />kingdom. <br />    That was not going to be yoked until Ravana cannot handle the <br />    opponent. That army , was in center of the universe under the <br />core <br />    of our earth, which I do not believe to be current Lanka.</p>
<p>      The only thing I can support to protect the 'bridge' is to <br />    prevent the natural structure of the place. </p>

<p>          Dear All, First of all very sorry for my late reply. Since <br />I <br />    was<br />          continuously out of station I couldn't reply in time.</p>
<p>          I thank Mr.Udhankar for introducing me to this group. He <br />  asked <br />      me <br />        to<br />          discuss about the formation of Andaman and Nicobar <br />Islands, <br />        Nangavaram<br />          (Great Nicobar) and Adam's bridge to this group.</p>
<p>          Let me come to the latter issue first - Adam's bridge.<br />          After a short discussion with Udhankar I went through the <br />    details <br />        about the<br />          Adam's bridge (Ram Sethu). I found an article by <br />Ms.Vandana <br />        published in<br />          People's Democracy which addresses all our doubts. Then I <br />    decided <br />        that it'll<br />          be worthy to give the article as such here. Some of you <br />may <br />    not <br />        agree with<br />          the political/ideological criticism mentioned in that <br />  article <br />    but <br />        apart from<br />          that I feel the scientific evidence cited in it is very <br />fair <br />    and <br />        correct.<br />          please go through the following article.</p>
<p>          *Ram Sethu And Sethusamudram Project*</p>
<p>          *Vandana*</p>
<p>          DUSTED out of the attic, 144 year old project first <br />  envisaged <br />    by <br />        Commander A<br />          D Taylor of the Indian Marine in 1860, Sethusamudram Ship <br />    canal <br />        project<br />          (SSCP) has evoked mixed reaction. Seen as an opportunity <br />for <br />        development by<br />          attracting cargo vessels to ports in the Eastern Coast, <br />        particularly<br />          Tuticorin port, the project is viewed by some as long over <br />    due. <br />        Others<br />          citing various environmental issues as well as that the <br />    project <br />        would become<br />          uneconomical due to large scale sedimentation witnessed in <br />    this <br />        region of<br />          ocean consider it as uneconomical. </p>
<p>          Pegged at about Rs.2,250 crores cost, the Sethusamudram <br />Ship <br />      Canal <br />        Project<br />          (SSCP) aims at dredging the shallow ocean and crating an <br />        artificial canal<br />          that could provide passage to draft ships and cargo <br />    containers. <br />        SSCP will<br />          link the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay in the southeastern <br />  coast <br />    of <br />        India. The<br />          total length of SSCP would be about 260 km, covering Palk <br />  Bay, <br />        Adam's bridge<br />          and Gulf of Mannar regions. The project envisages dredging <br />a <br />      width <br />        of 300<br />          meters of this stretch to provide a continuous navigable <br />  route <br />      cut <br />        through<br />          Adam's Bridge, a natural chain of shoals to avoid <br />      circumnavigating <br />        Sri<br />          Lanka. The canal will have an average depth of 12 metres <br />    enabling <br />        10,000 to<br />          12,000 GRT (gross registered ton) vessels to pass through. <br />  At <br />        present for<br />          the ships to port at Tuticorin, they have to go around Sri <br />    Lanka <br />        cruising<br />          additional 360 miles and wasting about 36 hrs.</p>
<p>          Right from the day the project was inaugurated it has <br />    witnessed <br />        hostility<br />          from various quarters. Opposition ranged from much <br />    anticipated 'no<br />          development' environmentalists, inevitable unhealthy <br />  political <br />        opposition<br />          for the sake of stealing the thunder out of the ruling <br />party <br />    and<br />          dispassionate scientific scepticism that cautioned about <br />the <br />        potential mass<br />          sedimentation in the region and fragile eco-system in the <br />    region. <br />        While it<br />          is important to address the genuine concerns and find a <br />    balanced <br />        development<br />          path that meets the need of short term immediate needs of <br />  the <br />        people of the<br />          locality as well as long term sustainability, frivolous <br />      opposition <br />        is<br />          injurious to development and rational public debates on <br />        developmental<br />          policy.</p>
<p>          To buttress their ludicrous claim they have once again <br />      resurrected <br />        false and<br />          forged story circulated by the Sangh Parivar earlier. <br />Sangh <br />      Parivar<br />          affiliated news services stated in 1992 that US agency's <br />  space <br />        borne cameras<br />          had discovered the remains of the mythical bridge built by <br />    Rama <br />        across the<br />          Palk Strait. Further it is asserted that the NASA had <br />    concluded <br />        that the<br />          bridge to be man-made from the 'bridge?s unique curvature <br />  and <br />        composition by<br />          age'. Arguing that the legends as well as archaeological <br />    studies <br />        reveal that<br />          the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date <br />back <br />  to <br />      the <br />        primitive<br />          age, about 1,750,000 years ago and the bridge?s age is <br />also <br />    almost<br />          equivalent. As Rama's rein was to have taken place during <br />    tredha <br />        yuga (more<br />          than 1,700,000 years ago) and the alleged age of <br />  the 'bridge' <br />        match. </p>
<p>        The media woke-up to<br />        the fraud when the matter was verified with NASA. Writing in <br />        Hindustan Times<br />        on October 17, 2002, its Washington correspondent S <br />  Rajagopalan <br />        wrote that<br />        'NASA poured cold water on the claims' citing NASA official <br />  Mark <br />        Hess<br />        categorically stated that 'Remote sensing images or <br />  photographs <br />        from orbit<br />        cannot provide direct information about the origin or age of <br />a <br />        chain of<br />        islands, and certainly cannot determine whether humans were <br />        involved in<br />        producing any of the patterns seen'. NASA distanced itself <br />  from <br />      the <br />        story<br />        and stated that it made no claims whatsoever regarding the <br />age <br />    or <br />        nature of<br />        the shoals in the region.</p>
<p>        Using the Survey of India (SOI)<br />          topographic map and IRS LISS-III satellite data, changes <br />in <br />        coastal and<br />          off-shore morphology of the Gulf of Mannar have been <br />  studied. <br />      Some <br />        of the<br />          studies indicate that there is a decrease of 0.51m in the <br />  sea <br />        floor depth<br />          all along shelf-region of the Gulf of Mannar between 1975-<br />    1999. <br />        Seaward<br />          migration of shoreline is said to be evident. Further it <br />is <br />        postulated that<br />          the Gulf of Mannar seafloor has been rising by tectonic <br />    movement <br />      as<br />          indicated by the newly formed spits, swales, beach ridges, <br />      mudflat,<br />          strandlines and reduction of seafloor depth. </p>
<p>        The chain of shoals that are<br />        popularly called as 'Adam's Bridge' are nothing but such <br />    accretion <br />        of<br />        littoral currents in this region.</p>
<p>          When the controversy emerged earlier the age of the Adam's <br />    Bridge <br />        shoals was<br />          questioned. Talking to the reporter of Indian Express, <br />    (published <br />        on Feb 3,<br />          2003) Professor S.M. Ramasamy of Centre for Remote Sensing <br />    (CRS) <br />      of<br />          Bharathidasan University, Tiruchi had asserted that the <br />  Adam's <br />        bridge over<br />          Palk Strait is about 3,500 years and not 1.7 million <br />years. <br />        Further he clarified that the carbon dating of some ancient<br />          beaches between Thiruthuraipoondi and Kodiyakarai show the <br />        Thiruthuraipoondi<br />          beach dates back to 6,000 years and the Kodiyakarai beach <br />to <br />      1,100 <br />        years. In<br />          other words, the sea was near Thiruthuraipoondi 6,000 <br />years <br />    ago <br />        and reached<br />          Kodiyakarai only around 1,100 years ago. Attributing the <br />      formation <br />        of the<br />          shoals to long shore drifting currents, Ramaswamy <br />explained <br />    that <br />        consequent<br />          dumping of sand in a linear pattern along the current <br />shadow <br />    zone <br />        between<br />          Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar resulted in the 'bridge'. </p>
<p>        It is noteworthy that N. Ramanujam, Head, Post Graduate <br />    Department <br />      of<br />          Geology and Research Centre, V.O . Chidambaram College <br />    assailed <br />        that 'Adam's Bridge is not a man made<br />          structure rather it's a geological phenomenon' (reported <br />in <br />    The <br />        Hindu, March<br />          17, 2007). </p>
<p>        Explaining that the Adam's Bridge is only a chain of shoals<br />          between the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar, created by <br />        sedimentation<br />          owing to long shore currents, Ramanujam traced the <br />  geological <br />        history of the<br />          Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. </p>
<p>        The region was part of Cauvery basin,<br />          which was formed during the separation of India and <br />  Antarctica <br />        about 70<br />          million years ago during the `Gondwana period.' The long <br />  shore <br />        currents on<br />          the southern side of island created a discontinuous <br />  shoreline <br />        eastward from<br />          Dhanuskodi to Talaimannar, which is the Adam's Bridge.</p>
<p>          While the need to debate and discuss questions of <br />    environmental <br />        concerns and<br />          economic viability could be understood, communal twists to <br />        developmental<br />          concern is a tragedy. <br />          Regards<br />          Siddharth</p></vijayanmsm@></p></udanks@></p></sps10142004@></p></kalinga_tamil@></p></blockquote>

<p>    As much as I trust and believe in Rama and Ramayana, I do not <br />  believe in the Ramar palam proclaimed as now the original. I <br />believe <br />  the real Lanka during the Ravana time is under water. This may <br />sound <br />  blasphemous to many who hear, but I believe the currentl Lanka was <br />  also a part of the Bharatha Maha kandam as to thousands of <br />centuries <br />  ago. <br />    The lanka taked by Ramayana is a harcode island, far off from <br />  the tip of southern India. </p>
<p>    Why I believe so...</p>
<p>    Lanka, Ravana's land, viewable only by Sampati from the <br />mountain <br />  top. Even angada who can jump 2000 yojanas would not be able to <br />  reach the island and it was possible only by Maruthi who could do <br />  atleast 8000 yojanas in one leap. Going by this standard alone, <br />  either the land mass between the ends where the monkey's stood and <br />  Lanka is totally not visible. I am sure people who have visited <br />  Danush kodi will feel other wise on the view part.</p>
<p>    A cue to be taken from Thirupugazh, in a song about Kathir <br />Kamam<br />  (which belonged to a part of the Skanda territory hence the great <br />  temples of Kandi and Kathir kamam).<br />    Uduka thugil vendum is a brilliant song about Kathirkamam.<br />    The 2nd half of verses say, Kudakku sila thuthar theduga.. (go <br />  to the southern most tip until to find Her) was the command from <br />  Sugreeva, hence start forth Hanuman Angada , Jambhavan etc, <br />Hanuman <br />  ends up finding her and burning lanka... while his return journey, <br />  he takes a break at Manikka gangai and seeks the Blessing of the <br />  Lord who stands there in a formless entity (documented in <br />  Kathirkamam too) and the Lord of all battles between G vs E to <br />  prepare for the great War. </p>
<p>    After his tail was on fire and the lankan army after him, he <br />  could not have rested inside Lanka to do this bath and prayer. <br />  Defies logic. </p>
<p>    Going back into Ramayana: Ravana possesed the moola bala <br />sainya <br />  which was the greatest demon army ever, housed under his kingdom. <br />  That was not going to be yoked until Ravana cannot handle the <br />  opponent. That army , was in center of the universe under the core <br />  of our earth, which I do not believe to be current Lanka.</p>
<p>    The only thing I can support to protect the 'bridge' is to <br />  prevent the natural structure of the place. </p>

<p>        Dear All, First of all very sorry for my late reply. Since I <br />  was<br />        continuously out of station I couldn't reply in time.</p>
<p>        I thank Mr.Udhankar for introducing me to this group. He <br />asked <br />    me <br />      to<br />        discuss about the formation of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, <br />      Nangavaram<br />        (Great Nicobar) and Adam's bridge to this group.</p>
<p>        Let me come to the latter issue first - Adam's bridge.<br />        After a short discussion with Udhankar I went through the <br />  details <br />      about the<br />        Adam's bridge (Ram Sethu). I found an article by Ms.Vandana <br />      published in<br />        People's Democracy which addresses all our doubts. Then I <br />  decided <br />      that it'll<br />        be worthy to give the article as such here. Some of you may <br />  not <br />      agree with<br />        the political/ideological criticism mentioned in that <br />article <br />  but <br />      apart from<br />        that I feel the scientific evidence cited in it is very fair <br />  and <br />      correct.<br />        please go through the following article.</p>
<p>        *Ram Sethu And Sethusamudram Project*</p>
<p>        *Vandana*</p>
<p>        DUSTED out of the attic, 144 year old project first <br />envisaged <br />  by <br />      Commander A<br />        D Taylor of the Indian Marine in 1860, Sethusamudram Ship <br />  canal <br />      project<br />        (SSCP) has evoked mixed reaction. Seen as an opportunity for <br />      development by<br />        attracting cargo vessels to ports in the Eastern Coast, <br />      particularly<br />        Tuticorin port, the project is viewed by some as long over <br />  due. <br />      Others<br />        citing various environmental issues as well as that the <br />  project <br />      would become<br />        uneconomical due to large scale sedimentation witnessed in <br />  this <br />      region of<br />        ocean consider it as uneconomical. </p>
<p>        Pegged at about Rs.2,250 crores cost, the Sethusamudram Ship <br />    Canal <br />      Project<br />        (SSCP) aims at dredging the shallow ocean and crating an <br />      artificial canal<br />        that could provide passage to draft ships and cargo <br />  containers. <br />      SSCP will<br />        link the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay in the southeastern <br />coast <br />  of <br />      India. The<br />        total length of SSCP would be about 260 km, covering Palk <br />Bay, <br />      Adam's bridge<br />        and Gulf of Mannar regions. The project envisages dredging a <br />    width <br />      of 300<br />        meters of this stretch to provide a continuous navigable <br />route <br />    cut <br />      through<br />        Adam's Bridge, a natural chain of shoals to avoid <br />    circumnavigating <br />      Sri<br />        Lanka. The canal will have an average depth of 12 metres <br />  enabling <br />      10,000 to<br />        12,000 GRT (gross registered ton) vessels to pass through. <br />At <br />      present for<br />        the ships to port at Tuticorin, they have to go around Sri <br />  Lanka <br />      cruising<br />        additional 360 miles and wasting about 36 hrs.</p>
<p>        Right from the day the project was inaugurated it has <br />  witnessed <br />      hostility<br />        from various quarters. Opposition ranged from much <br />  anticipated 'no<br />        development' environmentalists, inevitable unhealthy <br />political <br />      opposition<br />        for the sake of stealing the thunder out of the ruling party <br />  and<br />        dispassionate scientific scepticism that cautioned about the <br />      potential mass<br />        sedimentation in the region and fragile eco-system in the <br />  region. <br />      While it<br />        is important to address the genuine concerns and find a <br />  balanced <br />      development<br />        path that meets the need of short term immediate needs of <br />the <br />      people of the<br />        locality as well as long term sustainability, frivolous <br />    opposition <br />      is<br />        injurious to development and rational public debates on <br />      developmental<br />        policy.</p>
<p>        To buttress their ludicrous claim they have once again <br />    resurrected <br />      false and<br />        forged story circulated by the Sangh Parivar earlier. Sangh <br />    Parivar<br />        affiliated news services stated in 1992 that US agency's <br />space <br />      borne cameras<br />        had discovered the remains of the mythical bridge built by <br />  Rama <br />      across the<br />        Palk Strait. Further it is asserted that the NASA had <br />  concluded <br />      that the<br />        bridge to be man-made from the 'bridge?s unique curvature <br />and <br />      composition by<br />        age'. Arguing that the legends as well as archaeological <br />  studies <br />      reveal that<br />        the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back <br />to <br />    the <br />      primitive<br />        age, about 1,750,000 years ago and the bridge?s age is also <br />  almost<br />        equivalent. As Rama's rein was to have taken place during <br />  tredha <br />      yuga (more<br />        than 1,700,000 years ago) and the alleged age of <br />the 'bridge' <br />      match. </p>
<p>      The media woke-up to<br />      the fraud when the matter was verified with NASA. Writing in <br />      Hindustan Times<br />      on October 17, 2002, its Washington correspondent S <br />Rajagopalan <br />      wrote that<br />      'NASA poured cold water on the claims' citing NASA official <br />Mark <br />      Hess<br />      categorically stated that 'Remote sensing images or <br />photographs <br />      from orbit<br />      cannot provide direct information about the origin or age of a <br />      chain of<br />      islands, and certainly cannot determine whether humans were <br />      involved in<br />      producing any of the patterns seen'. NASA distanced itself <br />from <br />    the <br />      story<br />      and stated that it made no claims whatsoever regarding the age <br />  or <br />      nature of<br />      the shoals in the region.</p>
<p>      Using the Survey of India (SOI)<br />        topographic map and IRS LISS-III satellite data, changes in <br />      coastal and<br />        off-shore morphology of the Gulf of Mannar have been <br />studied. <br />    Some <br />      of the<br />        studies indicate that there is a decrease of 0.51m in the <br />sea <br />      floor depth<br />        all along shelf-region of the Gulf of Mannar between 1975-<br />  1999. <br />      Seaward<br />        migration of shoreline is said to be evident. Further it is <br />      postulated that<br />        the Gulf of Mannar seafloor has been rising by tectonic <br />  movement <br />    as<br />        indicated by the newly formed spits, swales, beach ridges, <br />    mudflat,<br />        strandlines and reduction of seafloor depth. </p>
<p>      The chain of shoals that are<br />      popularly called as 'Adam's Bridge' are nothing but such <br />  accretion <br />      of<br />      littoral currents in this region.</p>
<p>        When the controversy emerged earlier the age of the Adam's <br />  Bridge <br />      shoals was<br />        questioned. Talking to the reporter of Indian Express, <br />  (published <br />      on Feb 3,<br />        2003) Professor S.M. Ramasamy of Centre for Remote Sensing <br />  (CRS) <br />    of<br />        Bharathidasan University, Tiruchi had asserted that the <br />Adam's <br />      bridge over<br />        Palk Strait is about 3,500 years and not 1.7 million years. <br />      Further he clarified that the carbon dating of some ancient<br />        beaches between Thiruthuraipoondi and Kodiyakarai show the <br />      Thiruthuraipoondi<br />        beach dates back to 6,000 years and the Kodiyakarai beach to <br />    1,100 <br />      years. In<br />        other words, the sea was near Thiruthuraipoondi 6,000 years <br />  ago <br />      and reached<br />        Kodiyakarai only around 1,100 years ago. Attributing the <br />    formation <br />      of the<br />        shoals to long shore drifting currents, Ramaswamy explained <br />  that <br />      consequent<br />        dumping of sand in a linear pattern along the current shadow <br />  zone <br />      between<br />        Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar resulted in the 'bridge'. </p>
<p>      It is noteworthy that N. Ramanujam, Head, Post Graduate <br />  Department <br />    of<br />        Geology and Research Centre, V.O . Chidambaram College <br />  assailed <br />      that 'Adam's Bridge is not a man made<br />        structure rather it's a geological phenomenon' (reported in <br />  The <br />      Hindu, March<br />        17, 2007). </p>
<p>      Explaining that the Adam's Bridge is only a chain of shoals<br />        between the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar, created by <br />      sedimentation<br />        owing to long shore currents, Ramanujam traced the <br />geological <br />      history of the<br />        Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. </p>
<p>      The region was part of Cauvery basin,<br />        which was formed during the separation of India and <br />Antarctica <br />      about 70<br />        million years ago during the `Gondwana period.' The long <br />shore <br />      currents on<br />        the southern side of island created a discontinuous <br />shoreline <br />      eastward from<br />        Dhanuskodi to Talaimannar, which is the Adam's Bridge.</p>
<p>        While the need to debate and discuss questions of <br />  environmental <br />      concerns and<br />        economic viability could be understood, communal twists to <br />      developmental<br />        concern is a tragedy. <br />        Regards<br />        Siddharth</p>

<p>Ramar Sethu and <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  </p>
<p>I had the opportunity to be an Archaeologist in Archaeological Survey <br />of India since 1970, and recently retired and would like to bring out <br />the following facts about Ramar Sethu Issue. To my knowledge no <br />archaeological expedition of any type either on Shore or off shore <br />was conducted to document the facts about the Ramar Sethu Bridge. <br />Neither there is any official publication on the type of Remains <br />there. </p>
<p>I was shocked to see the Affidavit filed by <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  in the Apex Court. It <br />was based on secondary resources from some other Agency. None of <br />Archaeologists, especially my old colleagues could have gone to that <br />level to file a casual Affidavit in the highest court of the country. <br />To my solace, now it is learnt that the officials involved both are <br />not Archaeologists but Administrative Officers. One is an Assistant <br />Director and another is Director Administration. The latter is from <br />Indian Revenue Service and entered the Survey on Deputation few <br />months back and bypassed the Senior Archaeologists of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  and <br />misinformed the Apex Court. The decline of the standard of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  is not <br />a sudden one, but for the past two decades Archaeologist is not <br />allowed to head it. Due to some flaw in the Central Recruitment Rules <br />amended during 1980s, no Archaeologist is made eligible to be the <br />Director General and IAS personnel lead it one by one with out even <br />basic knowledge on History or Archaeology. </acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>They represent the Nation in many International Bodies like UNESCO on <br />Archaeological matters and misrepresent the facts many times. This <br />time due to sensitivity of the Subject they were trapped in the Apex <br />Court. No Governement including BJP ever attempted to post a <br />technical DGA. We hope atleast now the Government will wake up to <br />restore the lost glory of the Survey. </p>

          Adam&#039;s Bridge or Ramar Paalam        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Tere are two questions to point<br />a. What really is Adam's bridge or Sethu samuthram.<br />b. Existance of Rama (as churned up and cleverly subsided by the Congress itself).</p>
<p>Question a, may be easy to prove, even by pointers in Hindu epics, forget delving into archealogy.</p>
<p>Question b, is definitely and clearly NOT related to question a. The truthful answer to question B in today's world is better hidden than discovered. Once the real discovery starts, it can possibly hint on confusing the state of minds who are not geared to understand the reality of Ram. One should start with the ancestors of Rama and the rules and conquers and mairrages and clans of them. Raghuvansha ruled for most of europe to end of asia. So where was Rama born ? Who are we ? What do u mean by India ? <br />I would be interested in seeing where all we look for answers, after all one should look only where one lost their keys... That is not in Sethu project...</p>
<p>This maps to the cluster of warring lords and the other thread of 'One country' so called Bharat.</p>
<p>Congress in its usual ignorance stirred a hornet's nest not knowing the impact. Let the war begin and let the Lord begin his rule :-) </p>

<p>      Dear All, First of all very sorry for my late reply. Since I <br />was<br />      continuously out of station I couldn't reply in time.</p>
<p>      I thank Mr.Udhankar for introducing me to this group. He asked <br />  me <br />    to<br />      discuss about the formation of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, <br />    Nangavaram<br />      (Great Nicobar) and Adam's bridge to this group.</p>
<p>      Let me come to the latter issue first - Adam's bridge.<br />      After a short discussion with Udhankar I went through the <br />details <br />    about the<br />      Adam's bridge (Ram Sethu). I found an article by Ms.Vandana <br />    published in<br />      People's Democracy which addresses all our doubts. Then I <br />decided <br />    that it'll<br />      be worthy to give the article as such here. Some of you may <br />not <br />    agree with<br />      the political/ideological criticism mentioned in that article <br />but <br />    apart from<br />      that I feel the scientific evidence cited in it is very fair <br />and <br />    correct.<br />      please go through the following article.</p>
<p>      *Ram Sethu And Sethusamudram Project*</p>
<p>      *Vandana*</p>
<p>      DUSTED out of the attic, 144 year old project first envisaged <br />by <br />    Commander A<br />      D Taylor of the Indian Marine in 1860, Sethusamudram Ship <br />canal <br />    project<br />      (SSCP) has evoked mixed reaction. Seen as an opportunity for <br />    development by<br />      attracting cargo vessels to ports in the Eastern Coast, <br />    particularly<br />      Tuticorin port, the project is viewed by some as long over <br />due. <br />    Others<br />      citing various environmental issues as well as that the <br />project <br />    would become<br />      uneconomical due to large scale sedimentation witnessed in <br />this <br />    region of<br />      ocean consider it as uneconomical. </p>
<p>      Pegged at about Rs.2,250 crores cost, the Sethusamudram Ship <br />  Canal <br />    Project<br />      (SSCP) aims at dredging the shallow ocean and crating an <br />    artificial canal<br />      that could provide passage to draft ships and cargo <br />containers. <br />    SSCP will<br />      link the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay in the southeastern coast <br />of <br />    India. The<br />      total length of SSCP would be about 260 km, covering Palk Bay, <br />    Adam's bridge<br />      and Gulf of Mannar regions. The project envisages dredging a <br />  width <br />    of 300<br />      meters of this stretch to provide a continuous navigable route <br />  cut <br />    through<br />      Adam's Bridge, a natural chain of shoals to avoid <br />  circumnavigating <br />    Sri<br />      Lanka. The canal will have an average depth of 12 metres <br />enabling <br />    10,000 to<br />      12,000 GRT (gross registered ton) vessels to pass through. At <br />    present for<br />      the ships to port at Tuticorin, they have to go around Sri <br />Lanka <br />    cruising<br />      additional 360 miles and wasting about 36 hrs.</p>
<p>      Right from the day the project was inaugurated it has <br />witnessed <br />    hostility<br />      from various quarters. Opposition ranged from much <br />anticipated 'no<br />      development' environmentalists, inevitable unhealthy political <br />    opposition<br />      for the sake of stealing the thunder out of the ruling party <br />and<br />      dispassionate scientific scepticism that cautioned about the <br />    potential mass<br />      sedimentation in the region and fragile eco-system in the <br />region. <br />    While it<br />      is important to address the genuine concerns and find a <br />balanced <br />    development<br />      path that meets the need of short term immediate needs of the <br />    people of the<br />      locality as well as long term sustainability, frivolous <br />  opposition <br />    is<br />      injurious to development and rational public debates on <br />    developmental<br />      policy.</p>
<p>      To buttress their ludicrous claim they have once again <br />  resurrected <br />    false and<br />      forged story circulated by the Sangh Parivar earlier. Sangh <br />  Parivar<br />      affiliated news services stated in 1992 that US agency's space <br />    borne cameras<br />      had discovered the remains of the mythical bridge built by <br />Rama <br />    across the<br />      Palk Strait. Further it is asserted that the NASA had <br />concluded <br />    that the<br />      bridge to be man-made from the 'bridge?s unique curvature and <br />    composition by<br />      age'. Arguing that the legends as well as archaeological <br />studies <br />    reveal that<br />      the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to <br />  the <br />    primitive<br />      age, about 1,750,000 years ago and the bridge?s age is also <br />almost<br />      equivalent. As Rama's rein was to have taken place during <br />tredha <br />    yuga (more<br />      than 1,700,000 years ago) and the alleged age of the 'bridge' <br />    match. </p>
<p>    The media woke-up to<br />    the fraud when the matter was verified with NASA. Writing in <br />    Hindustan Times<br />    on October 17, 2002, its Washington correspondent S Rajagopalan <br />    wrote that<br />    'NASA poured cold water on the claims' citing NASA official Mark <br />    Hess<br />    categorically stated that 'Remote sensing images or photographs <br />    from orbit<br />    cannot provide direct information about the origin or age of a <br />    chain of<br />    islands, and certainly cannot determine whether humans were <br />    involved in<br />    producing any of the patterns seen'. NASA distanced itself from <br />  the <br />    story<br />    and stated that it made no claims whatsoever regarding the age <br />or <br />    nature of<br />    the shoals in the region.</p>
<p>    Using the Survey of India (SOI)<br />      topographic map and IRS LISS-III satellite data, changes in <br />    coastal and<br />      off-shore morphology of the Gulf of Mannar have been studied. <br />  Some <br />    of the<br />      studies indicate that there is a decrease of 0.51m in the sea <br />    floor depth<br />      all along shelf-region of the Gulf of Mannar between 1975-<br />1999. <br />    Seaward<br />      migration of shoreline is said to be evident. Further it is <br />    postulated that<br />      the Gulf of Mannar seafloor has been rising by tectonic <br />movement <br />  as<br />      indicated by the newly formed spits, swales, beach ridges, <br />  mudflat,<br />      strandlines and reduction of seafloor depth. </p>
<p>    The chain of shoals that are<br />    popularly called as 'Adam's Bridge' are nothing but such <br />accretion <br />    of<br />    littoral currents in this region.</p>
<p>      When the controversy emerged earlier the age of the Adam's <br />Bridge <br />    shoals was<br />      questioned. Talking to the reporter of Indian Express, <br />(published <br />    on Feb 3,<br />      2003) Professor S.M. Ramasamy of Centre for Remote Sensing <br />(CRS) <br />  of<br />      Bharathidasan University, Tiruchi had asserted that the Adam's <br />    bridge over<br />      Palk Strait is about 3,500 years and not 1.7 million years. <br />    Further he clarified that the carbon dating of some ancient<br />      beaches between Thiruthuraipoondi and Kodiyakarai show the <br />    Thiruthuraipoondi<br />      beach dates back to 6,000 years and the Kodiyakarai beach to <br />  1,100 <br />    years. In<br />      other words, the sea was near Thiruthuraipoondi 6,000 years <br />ago <br />    and reached<br />      Kodiyakarai only around 1,100 years ago. Attributing the <br />  formation <br />    of the<br />      shoals to long shore drifting currents, Ramaswamy explained <br />that <br />    consequent<br />      dumping of sand in a linear pattern along the current shadow <br />zone <br />    between<br />      Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar resulted in the 'bridge'. </p>
<p>    It is noteworthy that N. Ramanujam, Head, Post Graduate <br />Department <br />  of<br />      Geology and Research Centre, V.O . Chidambaram College <br />assailed <br />    that 'Adam's Bridge is not a man made<br />      structure rather it's a geological phenomenon' (reported in <br />The <br />    Hindu, March<br />      17, 2007). </p>
<p>    Explaining that the Adam's Bridge is only a chain of shoals<br />      between the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar, created by <br />    sedimentation<br />      owing to long shore currents, Ramanujam traced the geological <br />    history of the<br />      Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. </p>
<p>    The region was part of Cauvery basin,<br />      which was formed during the separation of India and Antarctica <br />    about 70<br />      million years ago during the `Gondwana period.' The long shore <br />    currents on<br />      the southern side of island created a discontinuous shoreline <br />    eastward from<br />      Dhanuskodi to Talaimannar, which is the Adam's Bridge.</p>
<p>      While the need to debate and discuss questions of <br />environmental <br />    concerns and<br />      economic viability could be understood, communal twists to <br />    developmental<br />      concern is a tragedy. <br />      Regards<br />      Siddharth</p></vijayanmsm@></p></udanks@></p></sps10142004@></p></blockquote>

<p>      Dear All, First of all very sorry for my late reply. Since I <br />was<br />      continuously out of station I couldn't reply in time.</p>
<p>      I thank Mr.Udhankar for introducing me to this group. He asked <br />  me <br />    to<br />      discuss about the formation of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, <br />    Nangavaram<br />      (Great Nicobar) and Adam's bridge to this group.</p>
<p>      Let me come to the latter issue first - Adam's bridge.<br />      After a short discussion with Udhankar I went through the <br />details <br />    about the<br />      Adam's bridge (Ram Sethu). I found an article by Ms.Vandana <br />    published in<br />      People's Democracy which addresses all our doubts. Then I <br />decided <br />    that it'll<br />      be worthy to give the article as such here. Some of you may <br />not <br />    agree with<br />      the political/ideological criticism mentioned in that article <br />but <br />    apart from<br />      that I feel the scientific evidence cited in it is very fair <br />and <br />    correct.<br />      please go through the following article.</p>
<p>      *Ram Sethu And Sethusamudram Project*</p>
<p>      *Vandana*</p>
<p>      DUSTED out of the attic, 144 year old project first envisaged <br />by <br />    Commander A<br />      D Taylor of the Indian Marine in 1860, Sethusamudram Ship <br />canal <br />    project<br />      (SSCP) has evoked mixed reaction. Seen as an opportunity for <br />    development by<br />      attracting cargo vessels to ports in the Eastern Coast, <br />    particularly<br />      Tuticorin port, the project is viewed by some as long over <br />due. <br />    Others<br />      citing various environmental issues as well as that the <br />project <br />    would become<br />      uneconomical due to large scale sedimentation witnessed in <br />this <br />    region of<br />      ocean consider it as uneconomical. </p>
<p>      Pegged at about Rs.2,250 crores cost, the Sethusamudram Ship <br />  Canal <br />    Project<br />      (SSCP) aims at dredging the shallow ocean and crating an <br />    artificial canal<br />      that could provide passage to draft ships and cargo <br />containers. <br />    SSCP will<br />      link the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay in the southeastern coast <br />of <br />    India. The<br />      total length of SSCP would be about 260 km, covering Palk Bay, <br />    Adam's bridge<br />      and Gulf of Mannar regions. The project envisages dredging a <br />  width <br />    of 300<br />      meters of this stretch to provide a continuous navigable route <br />  cut <br />    through<br />      Adam's Bridge, a natural chain of shoals to avoid <br />  circumnavigating <br />    Sri<br />      Lanka. The canal will have an average depth of 12 metres <br />enabling <br />    10,000 to<br />      12,000 GRT (gross registered ton) vessels to pass through. At <br />    present for<br />      the ships to port at Tuticorin, they have to go around Sri <br />Lanka <br />    cruising<br />      additional 360 miles and wasting about 36 hrs.</p>
<p>      Right from the day the project was inaugurated it has <br />witnessed <br />    hostility<br />      from various quarters. Opposition ranged from much <br />anticipated 'no<br />      development' environmentalists, inevitable unhealthy political <br />    opposition<br />      for the sake of stealing the thunder out of the ruling party <br />and<br />      dispassionate scientific scepticism that cautioned about the <br />    potential mass<br />      sedimentation in the region and fragile eco-system in the <br />region. <br />    While it<br />      is important to address the genuine concerns and find a <br />balanced <br />    development<br />      path that meets the need of short term immediate needs of the <br />    people of the<br />      locality as well as long term sustainability, frivolous <br />  opposition <br />    is<br />      injurious to development and rational public debates on <br />    developmental<br />      policy.</p>
<p>      To buttress their ludicrous claim they have once again <br />  resurrected <br />    false and<br />      forged story circulated by the Sangh Parivar earlier. Sangh <br />  Parivar<br />      affiliated news services stated in 1992 that US agency's space <br />    borne cameras<br />      had discovered the remains of the mythical bridge built by <br />Rama <br />    across the<br />      Palk Strait. Further it is asserted that the NASA had <br />concluded <br />    that the<br />      bridge to be man-made from the 'bridge?s unique curvature and <br />    composition by<br />      age'. Arguing that the legends as well as archaeological <br />studies <br />    reveal that<br />      the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to <br />  the <br />    primitive<br />      age, about 1,750,000 years ago and the bridge?s age is also <br />almost<br />      equivalent. As Rama's rein was to have taken place during <br />tredha <br />    yuga (more<br />      than 1,700,000 years ago) and the alleged age of the 'bridge' <br />    match. </p>
<p>    The media woke-up to<br />    the fraud when the matter was verified with NASA. Writing in <br />    Hindustan Times<br />    on October 17, 2002, its Washington correspondent S Rajagopalan <br />    wrote that<br />    'NASA poured cold water on the claims' citing NASA official Mark <br />    Hess<br />    categorically stated that 'Remote sensing images or photographs <br />    from orbit<br />    cannot provide direct information about the origin or age of a <br />    chain of<br />    islands, and certainly cannot determine whether humans were <br />    involved in<br />    producing any of the patterns seen'. NASA distanced itself from <br />  the <br />    story<br />    and stated that it made no claims whatsoever regarding the age <br />or <br />    nature of<br />    the shoals in the region.</p>
<p>    Using the Survey of India (SOI)<br />      topographic map and IRS LISS-III satellite data, changes in <br />    coastal and<br />      off-shore morphology of the Gulf of Mannar have been studied. <br />  Some <br />    of the<br />      studies indicate that there is a decrease of 0.51m in the sea <br />    floor depth<br />      all along shelf-region of the Gulf of Mannar between 1975-<br />1999. <br />    Seaward<br />      migration of shoreline is said to be evident. Further it is <br />    postulated that<br />      the Gulf of Mannar seafloor has been rising by tectonic <br />movement <br />  as<br />      indicated by the newly formed spits, swales, beach ridges, <br />  mudflat,<br />      strandlines and reduction of seafloor depth. </p>
<p>    The chain of shoals that are<br />    popularly called as 'Adam's Bridge' are nothing but such <br />accretion <br />    of<br />    littoral currents in this region.</p>
<p>      When the controversy emerged earlier the age of the Adam's <br />Bridge <br />    shoals was<br />      questioned. Talking to the reporter of Indian Express, <br />(published <br />    on Feb 3,<br />      2003) Professor S.M. Ramasamy of Centre for Remote Sensing <br />(CRS) <br />  of<br />      Bharathidasan University, Tiruchi had asserted that the Adam's <br />    bridge over<br />      Palk Strait is about 3,500 years and not 1.7 million years. <br />    Further he clarified that the carbon dating of some ancient<br />      beaches between Thiruthuraipoondi and Kodiyakarai show the <br />    Thiruthuraipoondi<br />      beach dates back to 6,000 years and the Kodiyakarai beach to <br />  1,100 <br />    years. In<br />      other words, the sea was near Thiruthuraipoondi 6,000 years <br />ago <br />    and reached<br />      Kodiyakarai only around 1,100 years ago. Attributing the <br />  formation <br />    of the<br />      shoals to long shore drifting currents, Ramaswamy explained <br />that <br />    consequent<br />      dumping of sand in a linear pattern along the current shadow <br />zone <br />    between<br />      Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar resulted in the 'bridge'. </p>
<p>    It is noteworthy that N. Ramanujam, Head, Post Graduate <br />Department <br />  of<br />      Geology and Research Centre, V.O . Chidambaram College <br />assailed <br />    that 'Adam's Bridge is not a man made<br />      structure rather it's a geological phenomenon' (reported in <br />The <br />    Hindu, March<br />      17, 2007). </p>
<p>    Explaining that the Adam's Bridge is only a chain of shoals<br />      between the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar, created by <br />    sedimentation<br />      owing to long shore currents, Ramanujam traced the geological <br />    history of the<br />      Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. </p>
<p>    The region was part of Cauvery basin,<br />      which was formed during the separation of India and Antarctica <br />    about 70<br />      million years ago during the `Gondwana period.' The long shore <br />    currents on<br />      the southern side of island created a discontinuous shoreline <br />    eastward from<br />      Dhanuskodi to Talaimannar, which is the Adam's Bridge.</p>
<p>      While the need to debate and discuss questions of <br />environmental <br />    concerns and<br />      economic viability could be understood, communal twists to <br />    developmental<br />      concern is a tragedy. <br />      Regards<br />      Siddharth</p></vijayanmsm@></p></udanks@></p></sps10142004@></p></blockquote>

        <p>As much as I trust and believe in Rama and Ramayana, I do not believe in the Ramar palam proclaimed as now the original. I believe the real Lanka during the Ravana time is under water. This may sound blasphemous to many who hear, but I believe the currentl Lanka was also a part of the Bharatha Maha kandam as to thousands of centuries ago. <br />The lanka taked by Ramayana is a harcode island, far off from the tip of southern India. </p>
<p>Why I believe so...</p>
<p>Lanka, Ravana's land, viewable only by Sampati from the mountain top. Even angada who can jump 2000 yojanas would not be able to reach the island and it was possible only by Maruthi who could do atleast 8000 yojanas in one leap. Going by this standard alone, either the land mass between the ends where the monkey's stood and Lanka is totally not visible. I am sure people who have visited Danush kodi will feel other wise on the view part.</p>
<p>A cue to be taken from Thirupugazh, in a song about Kathir Kamam(which belonged to a part of the Skanda territory hence the great temples of Kandi and Kathir kamam).<br />Uduka thugil vendum is a brilliant song about Kathirkamam.<br />The 2nd half of verses say, Kudakku sila thuthar theduga.. (go to the southern most tip until to find Her) was the command from Sugreeva, hence start forth Hanuman Angada , Jambhavan etc, Hanuman ends up finding her and burning lanka... while his return journey, he takes a break at Manikka gangai and seeks the Blessing of the Lord who stands there in a formless entity (documented in Kathirkamam too) and the Lord of all battles between G vs E to prepare for the great War. </p>
<p>After his tail was on fire and the lankan army after him, he could not have rested inside Lanka to do this bath and prayer. Defies logic. </p>
<p>Going back into Ramayana: Ravana possesed the moola bala sainya which was the greatest demon army ever, housed under his kingdom. That was not going to be yoked until Ravana cannot handle the opponent. That army , was in center of the universe under the core of our earth, which I do not believe to be current Lanka.</p>

<p>    Dear All, First of all very sorry for my late reply. Since I was<br />    continuously out of station I couldn't reply in time.</p>
<p>    I thank Mr.Udhankar for introducing me to this group. He asked <br />me <br />  to<br />    discuss about the formation of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, <br />  Nangavaram<br />    (Great Nicobar) and Adam's bridge to this group.</p>
<p>    Let me come to the latter issue first - Adam's bridge.<br />    After a short discussion with Udhankar I went through the details <br />  about the<br />    Adam's bridge (Ram Sethu). I found an article by Ms.Vandana <br />  published in<br />    People's Democracy which addresses all our doubts. Then I decided <br />  that it'll<br />    be worthy to give the article as such here. Some of you may not <br />  agree with<br />    the political/ideological criticism mentioned in that article but <br />  apart from<br />    that I feel the scientific evidence cited in it is very fair and <br />  correct.<br />    please go through the following article.</p>
<p>    *Ram Sethu And Sethusamudram Project*</p>
<p>    *Vandana*</p>
<p>    DUSTED out of the attic, 144 year old project first envisaged by <br />  Commander A<br />    D Taylor of the Indian Marine in 1860, Sethusamudram Ship canal <br />  project<br />    (SSCP) has evoked mixed reaction. Seen as an opportunity for <br />  development by<br />    attracting cargo vessels to ports in the Eastern Coast, <br />  particularly<br />    Tuticorin port, the project is viewed by some as long over due. <br />  Others<br />    citing various environmental issues as well as that the project <br />  would become<br />    uneconomical due to large scale sedimentation witnessed in this <br />  region of<br />    ocean consider it as uneconomical. </p>
<p>    Pegged at about Rs.2,250 crores cost, the Sethusamudram Ship <br />Canal <br />  Project<br />    (SSCP) aims at dredging the shallow ocean and crating an <br />  artificial canal<br />    that could provide passage to draft ships and cargo containers. <br />  SSCP will<br />    link the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay in the southeastern coast of <br />  India. The<br />    total length of SSCP would be about 260 km, covering Palk Bay, <br />  Adam's bridge<br />    and Gulf of Mannar regions. The project envisages dredging a <br />width <br />  of 300<br />    meters of this stretch to provide a continuous navigable route <br />cut <br />  through<br />    Adam's Bridge, a natural chain of shoals to avoid <br />circumnavigating <br />  Sri<br />    Lanka. The canal will have an average depth of 12 metres enabling <br />  10,000 to<br />    12,000 GRT (gross registered ton) vessels to pass through. At <br />  present for<br />    the ships to port at Tuticorin, they have to go around Sri Lanka <br />  cruising<br />    additional 360 miles and wasting about 36 hrs.</p>
<p>    Right from the day the project was inaugurated it has witnessed <br />  hostility<br />    from various quarters. Opposition ranged from much anticipated 'no<br />    development' environmentalists, inevitable unhealthy political <br />  opposition<br />    for the sake of stealing the thunder out of the ruling party and<br />    dispassionate scientific scepticism that cautioned about the <br />  potential mass<br />    sedimentation in the region and fragile eco-system in the region. <br />  While it<br />    is important to address the genuine concerns and find a balanced <br />  development<br />    path that meets the need of short term immediate needs of the <br />  people of the<br />    locality as well as long term sustainability, frivolous <br />opposition <br />  is<br />    injurious to development and rational public debates on <br />  developmental<br />    policy.</p>
<p>    To buttress their ludicrous claim they have once again <br />resurrected <br />  false and<br />    forged story circulated by the Sangh Parivar earlier. Sangh <br />Parivar<br />    affiliated news services stated in 1992 that US agency's space <br />  borne cameras<br />    had discovered the remains of the mythical bridge built by Rama <br />  across the<br />    Palk Strait. Further it is asserted that the NASA had concluded <br />  that the<br />    bridge to be man-made from the 'bridge?s unique curvature and <br />  composition by<br />    age'. Arguing that the legends as well as archaeological studies <br />  reveal that<br />    the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to <br />the <br />  primitive<br />    age, about 1,750,000 years ago and the bridge?s age is also almost<br />    equivalent. As Rama's rein was to have taken place during tredha <br />  yuga (more<br />    than 1,700,000 years ago) and the alleged age of the 'bridge' <br />  match. </p>
<p>  The media woke-up to<br />  the fraud when the matter was verified with NASA. Writing in <br />  Hindustan Times<br />  on October 17, 2002, its Washington correspondent S Rajagopalan <br />  wrote that<br />  'NASA poured cold water on the claims' citing NASA official Mark <br />  Hess<br />  categorically stated that 'Remote sensing images or photographs <br />  from orbit<br />  cannot provide direct information about the origin or age of a <br />  chain of<br />  islands, and certainly cannot determine whether humans were <br />  involved in<br />  producing any of the patterns seen'. NASA distanced itself from <br />the <br />  story<br />  and stated that it made no claims whatsoever regarding the age or <br />  nature of<br />  the shoals in the region.</p>
<p>  Using the Survey of India (SOI)<br />    topographic map and IRS LISS-III satellite data, changes in <br />  coastal and<br />    off-shore morphology of the Gulf of Mannar have been studied. <br />Some <br />  of the<br />    studies indicate that there is a decrease of 0.51m in the sea <br />  floor depth<br />    all along shelf-region of the Gulf of Mannar between 1975-1999. <br />  Seaward<br />    migration of shoreline is said to be evident. Further it is <br />  postulated that<br />    the Gulf of Mannar seafloor has been rising by tectonic movement <br />as<br />    indicated by the newly formed spits, swales, beach ridges, <br />mudflat,<br />    strandlines and reduction of seafloor depth. </p>
<p>  The chain of shoals that are<br />  popularly called as 'Adam's Bridge' are nothing but such accretion <br />  of<br />  littoral currents in this region.</p>
<p>    When the controversy emerged earlier the age of the Adam's Bridge <br />  shoals was<br />    questioned. Talking to the reporter of Indian Express, (published <br />  on Feb 3,<br />    2003) Professor S.M. Ramasamy of Centre for Remote Sensing (CRS) <br />of<br />    Bharathidasan University, Tiruchi had asserted that the Adam's <br />  bridge over<br />    Palk Strait is about 3,500 years and not 1.7 million years. <br />  Further he clarified that the carbon dating of some ancient<br />    beaches between Thiruthuraipoondi and Kodiyakarai show the <br />  Thiruthuraipoondi<br />    beach dates back to 6,000 years and the Kodiyakarai beach to <br />1,100 <br />  years. In<br />    other words, the sea was near Thiruthuraipoondi 6,000 years ago <br />  and reached<br />    Kodiyakarai only around 1,100 years ago. Attributing the <br />formation <br />  of the<br />    shoals to long shore drifting currents, Ramaswamy explained that <br />  consequent<br />    dumping of sand in a linear pattern along the current shadow zone <br />  between<br />    Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar resulted in the 'bridge'. </p>
<p>  It is noteworthy that N. Ramanujam, Head, Post Graduate Department <br />of<br />    Geology and Research Centre, V.O . Chidambaram College assailed <br />  that 'Adam's Bridge is not a man made<br />    structure rather it's a geological phenomenon' (reported in The <br />  Hindu, March<br />    17, 2007). </p>
<p>  Explaining that the Adam's Bridge is only a chain of shoals<br />    between the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar, created by <br />  sedimentation<br />    owing to long shore currents, Ramanujam traced the geological <br />  history of the<br />    Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. </p>
<p>  The region was part of Cauvery basin,<br />    which was formed during the separation of India and Antarctica <br />  about 70<br />    million years ago during the `Gondwana period.' The long shore <br />  currents on<br />    the southern side of island created a discontinuous shoreline <br />  eastward from<br />    Dhanuskodi to Talaimannar, which is the Adam's Bridge.</p>
<p>    While the need to debate and discuss questions of environmental <br />  concerns and<br />    economic viability could be understood, communal twists to <br />  developmental<br />    concern is a tragedy. <br />    Regards<br />    Siddharth</p>

        <p>Dear mr. Balasubramani,</p>
<p>I agree it is a golden opportunity to undertake a study when dredging is<br />done, costly equipment is made available, divers are provided, and you<br />have chance to collect samples of dredged material. If you remember, my<br />objection was the reference email from Dr. N. Ganesan you had appended<br />to your message (18947). If that message is the reference for study,<br />then the study needs to be questioned. If you had mentioned about your<br />project, without quoting the message, I would not have responded.</p>
<p>Lot of water has flowed since then; I hope your programme proceeds as<br />per schedule and yields valuable data. The Sethu is a political dynamite<br />and delhi bosses will exert great pressure to get the answers they want.</p>
<p>Both in case of Rama Sethu and Ayodhya, the <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  has not followed true<br />scientific spirit.</acronym></p>
<p>Fortunately, our forum is free from politics and contentious issues.<br />This is not the right place to discuss such issues.</p>

Opposition ranged from much anticipated 'no<br />    development' environmentalists, inevitable unhealthy political <br />  opposition<br />    for the sake of stealing the thunder out of the ruling party and<br />    dispassionate scientific scepticism that cautioned about the <br />  potential mass<br />    sedimentation in the region and fragile eco-system in the region. <br />  While it<br />    is important to address the genuine concerns and find a balanced <br />  development<br />    path that meets the need of short term immediate needs of the <br />  people of the<br />    locality as well as long term sustainability, frivolous <br />opposition <br />  is<br />    injurious to development and rational public debates on <br />  developmental<br />    policy.</p>
<p>    To buttress their ludicrous claim they have once again <br />resurrected <br />  false and<br />    forged story circulated by the Sangh Parivar earlier. Sangh <br />Parivar<br />    affiliated news services stated in 1992 that US agency's space <br />  borne cameras<br />    had discovered the remains of the mythical bridge built by Rama <br />  across the<br />    Palk Strait. Further it is asserted that the NASA had concluded <br />  that the<br />    bridge to be man-made from the 'bridge?s unique curvature and <br />  composition by<br />    age'. Arguing that the legends as well as archaeological studies <br />  reveal that<br />    the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to <br />the <br />  primitive<br />    age, about 1,750,000 years ago and the bridge?s age is also almost<br />    equivalent. As Rama's rein was to have taken place during tredha <br />  yuga (more<br />    than 1,700,000 years ago) and the alleged age of the 'bridge' <br />  match. </p>
<p>  The media woke-up to<br />  the fraud when the matter was verified with NASA. Writing in <br />  Hindustan Times<br />  on October 17, 2002, its Washington correspondent S Rajagopalan <br />  wrote that<br />  'NASA poured cold water on the claims' citing NASA official Mark <br />  Hess<br />  categorically stated that 'Remote sensing images or photographs <br />  from orbit<br />  cannot provide direct information about the origin or age of a <br />  chain of<br />  islands, and certainly cannot determine whether humans were <br />  involved in<br />  producing any of the patterns seen'. NASA distanced itself from <br />the <br />  story<br />  and stated that it made no claims whatsoever regarding the age or <br />  nature of<br />  the shoals in the region.</p>
<p>  Using the Survey of India (SOI)<br />    topographic map and IRS LISS-III satellite data, changes in <br />  coastal and<br />    off-shore morphology of the Gulf of Mannar have been studied. <br />Some <br />  of the<br />    studies indicate that there is a decrease of 0.51m in the sea <br />  floor depth<br />    all along shelf-region of the Gulf of Mannar between 1975-1999. <br />  Seaward<br />    migration of shoreline is said to be evident. Further it is <br />  postulated that<br />    the Gulf of Mannar seafloor has been rising by tectonic movement <br />as<br />    indicated by the newly formed spits, swales, beach ridges, <br />mudflat,<br />    strandlines and reduction of seafloor depth. </p>
<p>  The chain of shoals that are<br />  popularly called as 'Adam's Bridge' are nothing but such accretion <br />  of<br />  littoral currents in this region.</p>
<p>    When the controversy emerged earlier the age of the Adam's Bridge <br />  shoals was<br />    questioned. Talking to the reporter of Indian Express, (published <br />  on Feb 3,<br />    2003) Professor S.M. Ramasamy of Centre for Remote Sensing (CRS) <br />of<br />    Bharathidasan University, Tiruchi had asserted that the Adam's <br />  bridge over<br />    Palk Strait is about 3,500 years and not 1.7 million years. <br />  Further he clarified that the carbon dating of some ancient<br />    beaches between Thiruthuraipoondi and Kodiyakarai show the <br />  Thiruthuraipoondi<br />    beach dates back to 6,000 years and the Kodiyakarai beach to <br />1,100 <br />  years. In<br />    other words, the sea was near Thiruthuraipoondi 6,000 years ago <br />  and reached<br />    Kodiyakarai only around 1,100 years ago. Attributing the <br />formation <br />  of the<br />    shoals to long shore drifting currents, Ramaswamy explained that <br />  consequent<br />    dumping of sand in a linear pattern along the current shadow zone <br />  between<br />    Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar resulted in the 'bridge'. </p>
<p>  It is noteworthy that N. Ramanujam, Head, Post Graduate Department <br />of<br />    Geology and Research Centre, V.O . Chidambaram College assailed  <br />  that 'Adam's Bridge is not a man made<br />    structure rather it's a geological phenomenon' (reported in The <br />  Hindu, March<br />    17, 2007). </p>
<p>  Explaining that the Adam's Bridge is only a chain of shoals<br />    between the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar, created by <br />  sedimentation<br />    owing to long shore currents, Ramanujam traced the geological <br />  history of the<br />    Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. </p>
<p>  The region was part of Cauvery basin,<br />    which was formed during the separation of India and Antarctica <br />  about 70<br />    million years ago during the `Gondwana period.' The long shore <br />  currents on<br />    the southern side of island created a discontinuous shoreline <br />  eastward from<br />    Dhanuskodi to Talaimannar, which is the Adam's Bridge.</p>
<p>    While the need to debate and discuss questions of environmental <br />  concerns and<br />    economic viability could be understood, communal twists to <br />  developmental<br />    concern is a tragedy. <br />    Regards<br />    Siddharth</p>

        <p>Now the government has withdrawn both the affidavits and the hearing is<br />postponed to Jan 1st week. Till then, hopefully, the palam is safe.</p>
<p>I have given below excerpts from a statement released by Sri Sri<br />Ravishankar yesterday. It is relevant for our group, as it relates to<br />history.</p>
<p>Sampath</p>
<p>Sri Sri Ravishankar denounces Centre's affidavit on Ram Sethu    <br />Bangalore, Sep 13: Renowned spiritual leader and founder of the Art of<br />Living Foundation Sri Sri Ravi Shankar today denounced the Centre's<br />affidavit before the Supreme Court on the Ram Sethu issue stating that<br />there was no historical evidence to establish existence of Sri Ram.</p>
<p>In a statement issued from Germany, Sri Sri Ravishankar said that<br />''Ramayana and Mahabharata are called Itihasas. Itihas means it<br />happened. This means that Sri Ram did exist as recorded in the Ramayana.<br />The ancient seers had made clear distinction between Puranas and<br />Itihasas. Puranas are mythological, symbolic stories and Itihasas are<br />that which actually happened''.</p>
<p>He said one could not dismiss Sri Ram as a mythological character just<br />because a lot of miracles were reported in his life and there are no<br />scientific evidences to prove them. ''There were unproven miracles in<br />the lives of the religious figures of other faiths'' he said adding ''if<br />we dismiss Sri Ram as fictitious character, then we have to dismiss all<br />the miracles in the lives of Jesus, Moses and Mohammed as myths'' he<br />added.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear All, First of all very sorry for my late reply. Since I was<br />  continuously out of station I couldn't reply in time.</p>
<p>  I thank Mr.Udhankar for introducing me to this group. He asked me <br />to<br />  discuss about the formation of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, <br />Nangavaram<br />  (Great Nicobar) and Adam's bridge to this group.</p>
<p>  Let me come to the latter issue first - Adam's bridge.<br />  After a short discussion with Udhankar I went through the details <br />about the<br />  Adam's bridge (Ram Sethu). I found an article by Ms.Vandana <br />published in<br />  People's Democracy which addresses all our doubts. Then I decided <br />that it'll<br />  be worthy to give the article as such here. Some of you may not <br />agree with<br />  the political/ideological criticism mentioned in that article but <br />apart from<br />  that I feel the scientific evidence cited in it is very fair and <br />correct.<br />  please go through the following article.</p>
<p>  *Ram Sethu And Sethusamudram Project*</p>
<p>  *Vandana*</p>
<p>  DUSTED out of the attic, 144 year old project first envisaged by <br />Commander A<br />  D Taylor of the Indian Marine in 1860, Sethusamudram Ship canal <br />project<br />  (SSCP) has evoked mixed reaction. Seen as an opportunity for <br />development by<br />  attracting cargo vessels to ports in the Eastern Coast, <br />particularly<br />  Tuticorin port, the project is viewed by some as long over due. <br />Others<br />  citing various environmental issues as well as that the project <br />would become<br />  uneconomical due to large scale sedimentation witnessed in this <br />region of<br />  ocean consider it as uneconomical. </p>
<p>  Pegged at about Rs.2,250 crores cost, the Sethusamudram Ship Canal <br />Project<br />  (SSCP) aims at dredging the shallow ocean and crating an <br />artificial canal<br />  that could provide passage to draft ships and cargo containers. <br />SSCP will<br />  link the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay in the southeastern coast of <br />India. The<br />  total length of SSCP would be about 260 km, covering Palk Bay, <br />Adam's bridge<br />  and Gulf of Mannar regions. The project envisages dredging a width <br />of 300<br />  meters of this stretch to provide a continuous navigable route cut <br />through<br />  Adam's Bridge, a natural chain of shoals to avoid circumnavigating <br />Sri<br />  Lanka. The canal will have an average depth of 12 metres enabling <br />10,000 to<br />  12,000 GRT (gross registered ton) vessels to pass through. At <br />present for<br />  the ships to port at Tuticorin, they have to go around Sri Lanka <br />cruising<br />  additional 360 miles and wasting about 36 hrs.</p>
<p>  Right from the day the project was inaugurated it has witnessed <br />hostility<br />  from various quarters. Opposition ranged from much anticipated 'no<br />  development' environmentalists, inevitable unhealthy political <br />opposition<br />  for the sake of stealing the thunder out of the ruling party and<br />  dispassionate scientific scepticism that cautioned about the <br />potential mass<br />  sedimentation in the region and fragile eco-system in the region. <br />While it<br />  is important to address the genuine concerns and find a balanced <br />development<br />  path that meets the need of short term immediate needs of the <br />people of the<br />  locality as well as long term sustainability, frivolous opposition <br />is<br />  injurious to development and rational public debates on <br />developmental<br />  policy.</p>
<p>  To buttress their ludicrous claim they have once again resurrected <br />false and<br />  forged story circulated by the Sangh Parivar earlier. Sangh Parivar<br />  affiliated news services stated in 1992 that US agency's space <br />borne cameras<br />  had discovered the remains of the mythical bridge built by Rama <br />across the<br />  Palk Strait. Further it is asserted that the NASA had concluded <br />that the<br />  bridge to be man-made from the 'bridge?s unique curvature and <br />composition by<br />  age'. Arguing that the legends as well as archaeological studies <br />reveal that<br />  the first signs of human inhabitants in Sri Lanka date back to the <br />primitive<br />  age, about 1,750,000 years ago and the bridge?s age is also almost<br />  equivalent. As Rama's rein was to have taken place during tredha <br />yuga (more<br />  than 1,700,000 years ago) and the alleged age of the 'bridge' <br />match. </p></blockquote>
<p>The media woke-up to<br />the fraud when the matter was verified with NASA. Writing in <br />Hindustan Times<br />on October 17, 2002, its Washington correspondent S Rajagopalan <br />wrote that<br />'NASA poured cold water on the claims' citing NASA official Mark <br />Hess<br />categorically stated that 'Remote sensing images or photographs <br />from orbit<br />cannot provide direct information about the origin or age of a <br />chain of<br />islands, and certainly cannot determine whether humans were <br />involved in<br />producing any of the patterns seen'. NASA distanced itself from the <br />story<br />and stated that it made no claims whatsoever regarding the age or <br />nature of<br />the shoals in the region.</p>
<p>Using the Survey of India (SOI)</p>
<blockquote><p>  topographic map and IRS LISS-III satellite data, changes in <br />coastal and<br />  off-shore morphology of the Gulf of Mannar have been studied. Some <br />of the<br />  studies indicate that there is a decrease of 0.51m in the sea <br />floor depth<br />  all along shelf-region of the Gulf of Mannar between 1975-1999. <br />Seaward<br />  migration of shoreline is said to be evident. Further it is <br />postulated that<br />  the Gulf of Mannar seafloor has been rising by tectonic movement as<br />  indicated by the newly formed spits, swales, beach ridges, mudflat,<br />  strandlines and reduction of seafloor depth. </p></blockquote>
<p>The chain of shoals that are<br />popularly called as 'Adam's Bridge' are nothing but such accretion <br />of<br />littoral currents in this region.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  When the controversy emerged earlier the age of the Adam's Bridge <br />shoals was<br />  questioned. Talking to the reporter of Indian Express, (published <br />on Feb 3,<br />  2003) Professor S.M. Ramasamy of Centre for Remote Sensing (CRS) of<br />  Bharathidasan University, Tiruchi had asserted that the Adam's <br />bridge over<br />  Palk Strait is about 3,500 years and not 1.7 million years. <br />Further he clarified that the carbon dating of some ancient<br />  beaches between Thiruthuraipoondi and Kodiyakarai show the <br />Thiruthuraipoondi<br />  beach dates back to 6,000 years and the Kodiyakarai beach to 1,100 <br />years. In<br />  other words, the sea was near Thiruthuraipoondi 6,000 years ago <br />and reached<br />  Kodiyakarai only around 1,100 years ago. Attributing the formation <br />of the<br />  shoals to long shore drifting currents, Ramaswamy explained that <br />consequent<br />  dumping of sand in a linear pattern along the current shadow zone <br />between<br />  Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar resulted in the 'bridge'. </p></blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that N. Ramanujam, Head, Post Graduate Department of</p>
<blockquote><p>  Geology and Research Centre, V.O . Chidambaram College assailed  <br />that 'Adam's Bridge is not a man made<br />  structure rather it's a geological phenomenon' (reported in The <br />Hindu, March<br />  17, 2007). </p></blockquote>
<p>Explaining that the Adam's Bridge is only a chain of shoals</p>
<blockquote><p>  between the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar, created by <br />sedimentation<br />  owing to long shore currents, Ramanujam traced the geological <br />history of the<br />  Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. </p></blockquote>
<p>The region was part of Cauvery basin,</p>
<blockquote><p>  which was formed during the separation of India and Antarctica <br />about 70<br />  million years ago during the `Gondwana period.' The long shore <br />currents on<br />  the southern side of island created a discontinuous shoreline <br />eastward from<br />  Dhanuskodi to Talaimannar, which is the Adam's Bridge.</p>
<p>  While the need to debate and discuss questions of environmental <br />concerns and<br />  economic viability could be understood, communal twists to <br />developmental<br />  concern is a tragedy. <br />  Regards<br />  Siddharth</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>  Dear All, First of all very sorry for my late reply. Since I was<br />  continuously out of station I couldn't reply in time.</p>
<p>  I thank Mr.Udhankar for introducing me to this group. He asked me to<br />  discuss about the formation of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Nangavaram<br />  (Great Nicobar) and Adam's bridge to this group.</p>
<p>  Let me come to the latter issue first - Adam's bridge.<br />=============================================</p></blockquote>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Muruganandam" <bmurga@... <br />wrote on 19.7.2005 (about TWO Years back ):</bmurga@...></p>
<p>Regarding Sethusamudhram project, here are some of the points which I<br />have<br />read in "Thuglak" some time back. I need to know whether these facts are<br />correct or not ?</p>
<p>a) When the project was conceived (approximately 140 years back), actual<br />tonnage of vessels plying were very low.<br />b) Now, this project is being aimed to increase the depth of sea so that<br />vessels upto tonnage of 25000 tonnes can use this canal.<br />c) However, there are very, very few commercial bulk carriers, tankers,<br />container vessels which have tonnage less than 25000 tonnes ply<br />around the<br />world.<br />d) As a matter of fact, even Shipping companies in India are having<br />vessels<br />more than 25000 tonnes and minimum size is on the upside only.<br />e) The estimated cost is around Rs.2400 crores and expected to be<br />completed<br />in 30 months time. Hopefully, the total cost should not exceed Rs4000<br />crores<br />(even assuming delay and inflation !)<br />f) To recover the above project costs, there are plans to recover as<br />below:</p>
<p>1) A ship shall be charged Rs.13000 per trip to use the canal.<br />(This is<br />required since pilot boats are required for guiding the main ships along<br />the canal).<br />2) The above tariff would put enormous pressure on government to<br />get the<br />moneyback from this project.</p>
<p>All the above points are purely based on commercial aspects.  <br />--------------------------------------------------<br />The above is a view of another journalist.</p>
<p>CM relied on an expert opinion that there was natural sediment.</p>
<p>Vandana does not seem to dispute.</p>
<p>Thanks for highlighting Vandhan's views.  <br />Thanks to Mr. Udhankar again.</p>
<p>Pls do contribute more and whenever possible.  </p>
