<p>Project: The fall of Chenla<br />Author: Lem Chuck Moth</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-----------</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />The assault of Chenla, mighty as it was, did no obviously wipe out <br />the Funan Empire entirely from the mainland of Indochina. As soon as <br />they repositioned themselves, the Funan rulers were engaging in <br />harassing the Chenla Empire and not before long they were able to <br />control the northern part of mainland Indochina. In an effort to <br />ease the tension with China, the Funan rulers sent diplomatic <br />embassies to the Chinese court. <br />In the periods of Won-to (618-626) and (627-649), says the history <br />of the Tang, the Funan resent theirs embassy to China court bringing <br />as tribute two men of white heads. <br />These historical facts agree with the Khmer tradition that during <br />the surprise attack of the Cham kings, the Thong Family took refuge <br />at Nokor Rajasima. <br />Taking by surprise, Prah bat Devavamsa escaped north to nokor <br />rajasima, in the territory of the great Kamboja. <br />As Bhavavarman had his mind changed about Buddhism and married the <br />princess Kambojarajalaksmi of the original Funan line, his political <br />standing about the Funan Empire was changed. Undoubtedly, Dvaravati <br />under a direct descendant of the royal couple was aligning itself <br />with the displaced Funan kings to fight against Isanavarman. <br />THE EMERGENCE OF SRI VIJAYA<br />The Chinese monk I-ching on his pilgrimage to India stopped at South <br />East Asia and wrote at the end of the seventh century. In former <br />Funan the law of the Buddha prospered and spread, but a wicked king <br />has completely destroyed it and there are no more monks. The event <br />was undoubtedly related to the assault of Chenla over the Funan <br />Empire and the "wicked king" was no other than the Chenla king <br />Bhavavarman or his brother Citrasena. His coronation name <br />Bhavavarman, a prot?g? of Bhava clearly indicates his devotion to <br />Visnite Cult. This devotion was undoubtedly the cause of conflict <br />against the last Buddhist King Rudravarman of Funan. The Mon <br />Tradition appeared to have a clear recollection of the legendary <br />king Tisa of Takkasila whom we had identified as Bhavavarman. A Mon <br />Chronicle recalls a severe set back of Buddhism under his reign. <br />There was a king of Thaton named Kalavantisa; a group of naga had <br />persuaded him to destroy Buddhism. All Buddha images had been thrown <br />in the river. There was a daughter of a wealthy family name Mith Tho <br />who was a devout Buddhist. Ignoring the king's order, she went on <br />saving the Buddha images and kept them in her house. Accusing of <br />violating the king order, she was sentenced to dead. However, <br />protected by her merit, the executor was not able to do his job, no <br />matter which way he tried. He failed to kill her either by burning <br />or put her in an elephant path. In frustration, the king asked her <br />if she knows of any magic. She replied that the only magic she knows <br />is her belief in Buddha's teaching. The king Tisa, recognizing his <br />mistake, converted himself to Buddhism and took Mith Tho as his <br />queen (*). <br />As we had seen (Chenla: LCM), Bhavavarman posthumous name was <br />Kalakantisapada that relates him to the Kala king Tisa of the story. <br />Devoted to Vinuite, he was misled by the nagas to wipe out Buddhism <br />from the Funan Kingdom. Just as the legend says, a devoted Buddhist <br />name Mit-tho saved him from the madness and after marrying her he <br />became a devote Buddhist himself. Many Khmer inscription mention <br />that his queen Kambojarajalaksmi was a relative of the Kambojan king <br />Shrestavarman royal line whose connection with Buddhism was well <br />known during the Funan Empire. Undoubtedly she was the heroine of <br />the Mon legend who sacrificed her life to save Buddhism. Her <br />commemoration as the "Laksmi of Kamboja king" tells us, one way or <br />another, about her important role in the reign of her king. With her <br />devotion, Buddhism had been reinstated and thrived at full force to <br />become the dominant religion of the Sri Vijaya Empire. <br />The restoration of Buddhism<br />On his first trip to India in 671, I-ching recalled his stop for six <br />month at Ligor (Sri Dhammaraja) to study Sanskrit grammar. His note <br />on the stay provides important information about Buddhism practiced <br />at the region. <br />In the fortified city of Fo-shih, there are more than a thousand of <br />Buddhist priests whose minds are bent on study and good works. They <br />examine and study all possible subjects exactly as in Madhyadesa; <br />their rules and ceremonies are identical with those in India. <br />Clearly the contrast of Vyadhapura where Buddhism was virtually <br />destroyed (Chenla: LCM), Sri Dhammaraja emerged as the new Buddhist <br />cultural center of Southeast Asia. The practices were very much in <br />tune with India, that I-ching recommended to his fellow Chinese <br />monks who were looking for more in sight of Buddhism to stop first <br />at Sri Dhammaraja. <br />If a Chinese priest wishes to go to the west to understand and read <br />the original Buddhist texts there, he would be wise to spend a year <br />or two in Fo-shih and practice the proper rules there; he might then <br />go on to central India. <br />On his return from India where he spent ten years at the University <br />of Nalanda, I-ching spent four more years at Fo-shih between 685 and <br />689. He had copied and translated Sanskrit Buddhist texts into <br />Chinese. <br />Malayu under the Sri Vijaya<br />The new history of the Tang mentions the first embassy of Ma-lo-yu <br />in 644-45. In 689, he had recruited four collaborators from his <br />brief trip to Canton, he returned to settle in Fo-shih. During his <br />last stay, he stayed two months in Mo-lo-yu in 671 and noted in his <br />record that Mo-lo-yu is now the country of Shih-li-fo-shih. In the <br />inscription of Ligor (Southeast Malaya), there are commemoration, in <br />each face, of two kings apparently with different dynasties. On its <br />face A, there is reference to a Srivijaya king Dhamasetu. He <br />dedicated in 775 AD a shrine to Buddha and two Buddhisatvas. On its <br />other face B, there is a reference to a king who bears the title of <br />Maharaja, but the date and the name of the king was missing. <br />Scholars speculated that the latter king could the Seilendra king <br />Dharanindra of the time. The fact that two kings of different <br />dynasties chose the same stone to inscribe their own commemoration <br />reflects the collaboration between them. <br />THE LAST STANDING OF THE CHENLA COURT<br />Without the backing of his uncle Bhavavarman, Isanavarman obviously <br />strengthen his alliance with Champapura and both courts had turned <br />to China for support. It was happening during the Tang Dynasty whose <br />diplomacy with the Saka world resulted in the high achievement of <br />commercial development with the west. Beside the full control of the <br />Silk route at Central Asia, the Tang dynasty was looking to control <br />the southern provinces and Chenla was there to be allied with <br />(Chiangmai, LCM). <br />Relationship with Champapura <br />An inscription found at Mi-son (BEFEO t.3: Stele de Sambhuvarman a <br />Mison, M. L. Finot), not far from that of Bhadravarman recounted on <br />one of its face an event during the reign of Sri Rudravarman. In the <br />saka year, determined only by the legible digit 4 as a year of the <br />fifth century, a fire destroyed the sanctuary of the god Bhadrasvara <br />built by the first Bhadravarman. The next king, with the coronation <br />name (Abhisekanama) of Sambhuvarman and with the religious <br />(dindikanama) name of Prasasthadhamma, managed to restore the <br />sanctuary and rededicate to the god Sambhubhadrasvara. The <br />inscription, moreover, is the first inscription to mention about <br />Champa Desa in relation with the new court of Sambhupura. The <br />mentioning about Champadesa reveals that he was related to the <br />previous Champa court and was trying to bring back the Cham legacy. <br />Sambhuvarman whose reign ended in 629, received a delegation from <br />Chenla, minister Simhadeva of king Mahendravarman. His son <br />Kandarpadhamma succeeded him and had a peaceful reign. He sent rich <br />presents to the emperor Tai Tsung of the Tang in 630 and 631. The <br />Cham tradition mentions about the union between the Cham king <br />Jagadharma and the princess Sarvani, a daughter of Isanavarman. <br />Continuing the policy of his father, Isanavarman obviously <br />maintained good relationship with the Saka world, a Saka Bramhmana <br />arriving from the Dekkan also married one of his daughters. <br />The attack of the Mans<br />Chinese texts mention that during the reign of Isanavarman, Chenla <br />had made alliance with Thsan Pan and Tchu-Krang, but fought with Lin-<br />yi and Tai-Yuan. It indicates that Lin-yi (Prey-nokor) was not part <br />of Champapura and along with Tai-Yuan fought alongside the Funan <br />kings against Chenla. Champapura, on the other hand, had been in <br />good relationship with the Chenla Empire since the reign of <br />Mahendravarman. It appears that the Funan kings had managed to <br />capture back Prey-nokor and at the same time were helped by rulers <br />of Nan-chao whom the Chinese referred as the Man rebels. A Chinese <br />text recorded one of their attacks over the last of the Chenla <br />empire. <br />The Man rebels once led an army of cavalry as far as the seashore. <br />When they saw the green waves roaring and breaking, they felt <br />disappointed and took their army and went back home. <br />Another Chinese text (JA 46 (Nov. 1958): The early Siam in Burma's <br />History, G.H. Luce.) describes their attack against the city of Nu-<br />wang. <br />The City was Nu-wang and was located at over 30 day-stages distant <br />from Jin-Nan Chieh-tu on the Man and is 10 day-stages distant from <br />Huan-Chou. They regularly carried on trade with the common people of <br />Huan-Chou. The Man rebels once led 2000 men to attack the kingdom. <br />They were shot down by Nu-Wang with poisoned arrows. Not one in ten <br />survived. The Man rebels then retreated. <br />According to the Khmer chronicle, the Cham kings were loosing ground <br />and were forced to retreat. They had to reposition themselves to the <br />South. <br />He (Prah Thong) then strikes back to chase out the Cham kings; some <br />escaped to Bayangkau, some to the mount Isvara. <br />The story is checked-out by score of vestiges left behind by king <br />Isanavarman at the realm of the southern territory that includes a <br />stone temple built on mount Bayangkau. Another Chinese text (JA 46 <br />(Nov. 1958): The early Siam in Burma's History, G.H. Luce.) <br />describes similar attack by the Man rebels, this time to the ancient <br />Khmer (Kun-lun) territory where Isanavarman was taking refuge. <br />Kun-lun kingdom is 81 day-stages from the Man boarders (JA 46 (Nov. <br />1958): The early Siam in Burma's History, G.H. Luce.) Products of <br />the land are the dark wood perfume, sandalwood perfume, dark-red <br />sandalwood perfume, betel-nut trees, glazed ware, rock crystal, <br />bottle gourds, unburned brick, etc..., various perfumes and herbs, <br />precious stones, rhinoceros, etc. Once the Man rebels led an army <br />with cavalry to attack it. The (people of) Kun-lun kingdom left the <br />road open and let them advance. Then they cut the road behind the <br />army and connected it with the river, letting the water cover it. <br />Whether they advanced and retreated, (the Man) were helpless. Over <br />ten thousands died of hunger. Of those who did not die, the Kun-lun <br />severed the right wrists and let them go home. <br />The passage indicates that the Khmer (Kun-lun) kingdom, obviously <br />under the Chenla kings, was fighting against the Man rebels forcing <br />them to withdraw after severe loss. But that was just another <br />setback, Chenla along with Champapura was gradually loosing ground <br />and finally were forced off the mainland. <br />The last records<br />The inscription of Ang Chumnik ends its genealogy of the Chenla <br />kings with Jayavarman I (657-681) who is mentioned as the son of <br />Isanavarman. Found at Ba Phnom, the inscription was inscribed by <br />members of the Chenla court and provided good information about the <br />end of the Chenla Empire. The inscription indicates that Jayavarman <br />I left the court to his uncle of mother side who took care of the <br />family's fortune. <br />Next the king (Jayavarman I), with all marks of honor, left (the <br />court) to brother of his mother, who without having the title, <br />enjoyed the fortune of a king. <br />The inscription does not provide any more information about him but <br />along with other inscriptions give however whimsy picture of the <br />Chenla court at Ba Phnom. One inscription left by his daughter, <br />queen Jayadevi mentioned donations to a sanctuary of Siva <br />Tripurantaka and complained of the misfortunes of the times. This <br />sanctuary was founded by the princess Sophajaya, also a daughter of <br />Jayavarman I who married the Sivaite Brahman Sakravarmin born in <br />India. The unfortunate circumstances mentioned in many of the <br />inscriptions, could be a prelude to the end of the Chenla court. The <br />inscription of Ang Chunik mentions next the formation of the city <br />Adhyapura under the government of Jayavarman's uncle. <br />After the rule of succession of the family, the king by recognizing <br />that he was the righteous man commissioned him with honor to take <br />care the government of the city of Adhyapura. Then only under his <br />ruling with justice that procured the non-stop prosperity, the city <br />of Adhyapura had lived up to its name. <br />That was presumably the fate of the Chenla court; under the control <br />of the new Khmer Empire, it was reduced back to its beginning, a <br />wealthy society holding no status of kingship. <br />Adhyapura <br />We could identify without much doubt that Adhyapura was at the site <br />of Ba Phnom. During the breakup of the Funan Empire, it was known as <br />the Kun Lun Kingdom in Chinese text and was the seat of the last <br />Chenla Empire. It was at this place that I-ching mentioned about the <br />fate of the Buddhism religion during the Chenla attack. <br />Setting out south-westwards, one reaches within a month, Poh-nan <br />(Kuo), formaly called Fu-nan. Of old it was a country, the <br />inhabitants of which lived naked; the people were mostly worshippers <br />of heaven. Later on, Buddhism flourished there, but a wicked king <br />has now expelled and exterminated them all, and there are no members <br />of the Buddhist Brotherhood at all, while adherents of other <br />religions live intermingled. <br />Poh-nan is obviously I-ching's reference to Ba Phnom which was <br />previously the capital of the Funan Empire subjugated by the Chenla <br />Empire. <br />Lingaparvata<br />An inscription found at Vat Phu (BEFEO II: Stele de Vat Phu, M. A. <br />Barth) witnesses the presence of Jayavarman I at the location <br />mentioned in the inscription as Lingaparvata, on the Khorat Plateau <br />far away north from Ba-phnom. <br />The master of masters of the land, Sri Jayavarman, issues his <br />command (as followed): At this Srimate Lingaparvata, all the living <br />of this place would not be harmed by nobody, even if they had <br />committed sins. What offering to God here, or others would stay as <br />his. <br />This is the first inscription that refers Wat Phu as Lingaparvata. <br />To the Chenla court, Lingaparvatava was the sacred place for the <br />Chenla King to perform the annual human sacrifice (Chenla, LCM). The <br />inscription implicates that the sacrifice was still carried on <br />during the reign of Jayavarman I whose reign marked the decline of <br />the Chenla Empire. The passage seams to indicate that the goal of <br />the sacrifice was to be protected by God from any harm, regardless <br />of the sins they have committed. During the last of his reign, <br />Jayavarman I had to abandon Ba-phnom and moved the Chenla court up <br />north to Wat Phu. It was obviously a strategic move; closer to the <br />Chinese border, he could find protection from the Tang Dynasty <br />(Chiangmai, LCM). At the same time, evidences show that the Chenla <br />hard core with the legacy of the late king Isanavarman was already <br />regrouping in Central Java where they found support from the <br />emerging Chola Empire of South India. <br />THE RISE OF THE JAVANESE EMPIRE<br />Mataram had been cited in Javanese legend to receive the Saka <br />immigrants from Gujarat since the (Sakadvipa, LCM) the antiquity <br />time. Under the control of sri Vijaya, the Saka communities in Java <br />appeared to stay in the background. After the fall of Chenla, the <br />situation was going to change as the New History of the Tang already <br />cited the emergence of a kingdom named Ho-ling in Central Java. <br />Ho-ling at Central Java<br />The New History of the Tang has many passages relating to the <br />Embassies of Ho-ling; the first three embassies were dated 640, 648 <br />and 666. The Chinese passage recounts the story of a queen named <br />Sima, apparently ruling over Ho-ling in 674. <br />The ruler of Ta-tche sent a bag of gold to be laid down within her <br />frontiers. The people, walking by, avoided the bag and it was <br />untouched for a long time. One day, one of the crown princes stepped <br />over it and the queen was furious. She ordered to have her own son <br />executed, but with the objection of her court, a compromise was set <br />to just cut off the toe that touch the bag of the gold. <br />The story obviously portrays a test of willpower orchestrated by the <br />kingdom of Ta-tche (the great kingdom) which is no other than the <br />Sri Vijaya Empire. As a new established state next to the already <br />powerful and rival Sri Vijaya, Ho-ling was not obviously welcome and <br />harassement continued. Through her determination, continues the <br />Chinese text, the queen Sima won respect from Ta-tche and we shall <br />see that her tenacity leaded to the formation of the Sanjaya Empire, <br />set to become a new maritime power of the South China sea. About the <br />origin of Ho-ling, we need to look back to what happened during the <br />fall of the Chenla Empire. The Chinese word "Ho-ling" is translated <br />into the river of reed, a reference to the province "Stung-treng" of <br />Cambodia. Evidence show that during its last stand at the mainland, <br />the Land Chenla relocated it capital to Stung-treng (Chiangmai,LCM). <br />The Javanese court might introduce itself the first time to the Tang <br />Dynasty as the Chenla court of Ho-ling. The reference however lasted <br />only a short while as the Chenla court of Ho-ling was about to <br />succumb and never been mentioned again in the next Chinese records. <br />Cho-pa or She-po, a reference to Champa, was also a reference of the <br />Javanese court in Chinese texts. These facts constituted evidence <br />that supports the connection between the displaced Chenla and Champa <br />courts with the formation of the new Javanese Empire. Another <br />supporting evidence to the same conclusion is the legacy of the late <br />Chenla king Isanavarman; Javanese inscriptions later attest the <br />reverence of IsanaBhadrasvara, the god king of Iasanavarman, as the <br />divine protector of the Javanese Empire. <br />Sanjaya <br />A Sanskrit inscription found in the central part of the Island of <br />Java among the ruins of the Sivaite sanctuary of Changal, was an <br />attribution to the king Sanjaya. The inscription mentions the <br />erection of a linga on the island of Yava. Described to be rich in <br />grain and gold mines, the country of Kunjarakunja appeared to be <br />located between Travancore and Tinnevelly, the site of the sanctuary <br />dedicated to the sage Agastya. In Indian Tradition, the sage Agastya <br />was credited to conquer the natural barrier between the <br />Transgangetic India and the south, and in the process bring along <br />the new development of the Sivaite culture from the north to the <br />South. As the sea communication between Java and the South Indian <br />continent was very much established since the antiquity time, this <br />South Indian cultural evolution obviously reached the Java Island. <br />Sanjaya was obviously patronizing this cultural transfer and was <br />capitalizing on it. The same inscription refers two royal figures of <br />the name Sanna and Sannaha as predecessors of Sanjaya. According to <br />Javanese Tradition (History of Indonesia, B. R. Chatterji), Sanna <br />and Sannaha were brother and sister, Sanjaya was the son of Sannaha. <br />Looking back into the Chenla legacies (The split of Chenla, LCM), <br />the daughter of Jayavarman I, queen Jayadevi mentioned in one of her <br />inscriptions about donations to a sanctuary of Siva Tripurantaka and <br />complained of the misfortunes of the times. This sanctuary was <br />founded by the princess Sophajaya, also a daughter of Jayavarman I <br />who married the Sivaite Brahman Sakravarmin born in India. It is in <br />high probability that this Sivaite Brahman was connected to the sage <br />Agastya who became to be known as the Sivaite Guru in South India. <br />This new development that was credited to the sage Agastya in <br />spreading the first time of Sivaite culture in South India was <br />strongly seen as contributing later to the emergence of the Chola <br />Empire. On the other hand, Sanjaya might have been related to the <br />queen Jayadevi who was portrayed as queen Sima in the Chinese story. <br />After their settlement, evidence show that the new Javanese rulers <br />did not forget theirs past glory over the mainland during the Chenla <br />era. Inscriptions of both Java and Champapura described the naval <br />attacks orchestrated by the Javanese Empire making its suzerainty <br />felt along the eastern coast of Indochinese Peninsula. This campaign <br />was obviously conducted in retaliation to the insult of the Khmer <br />prince, recounted in the Arab story (Dvaravati:The Cradle of the <br />Angkorian Empire, LCM). <br />Tribhuvanesvara <br />The inscription of Veal Kantel (Le cambodge:La region de Bassac, <br />Aymonier) commemorates the erection of the god king Tribhuvanesvara, <br />by the Brahman Somasarman, husband of a daughter of king Viravarman <br />and sister of Bhavavarman. The consecration was followed by the <br />usual presents to the God King, among them a complete set of <br />Mahabhatara, the Ramayana and the Purana. We shall see later <br />(Ramanadesa, LCM) that Tribhuvanaditya which is the visnuite version <br />of the sivaite Tribhuvanesvara, emerged later in the court of the <br />Talaing king Makutavamsa of Tathon and was retained in the court of <br />Ramandesa ever since. On the other hand, Tribhuvanesvara also <br />emerged in the Angkorian court during the high of the Chola <br />influence in Southeast Asia. Obviously Tribhuvanaditya was part of <br />the new Chola development in India that mirrored the global rise of <br />the Saka clan. <br />The Chola Connection<br />The connection between the South Indian Hindu religious development <br />with the rise of the Chenla Empire was obvious. Inscriptions witness <br />the marriage of Sakabhramanas from South India and princesses of <br />both the Chenla and Champa courts. The word "Chola" itself seems to <br />indicate that the connection was of Southeast Asian instead of <br />Indian origin. Since the very beginning, Chinese texts consistently <br />identified its connection with the Choladhara legacy of Prey Nokor <br />(Nagdvipa, LCM). The emergence of the Chola Empire of South India <br />was not by all means a coincident; it was the resuscitation of the <br />ancient Kamara legacy, this time under the Saka global leadership. <br />Fairly enough, the Chinese texts still used the word "Chu-lien" to <br />refer to the new Empire. For long, scholars had been puzzed about <br />Chinese texts mentioning about this Arianized dynasty being absorb <br />back into the Southeast Asian Sri Vijaya Empire, five centuries <br />later. Our evidence might help explain the enigma; the Arianized <br />world was transient and was a global development. In the Javanese <br />Ramayana (The Diversion: The exploit of Rama, LCM), the elder <br />brother Rama was depicted as a darker skin Saka while the younger <br />brother Lakshana was depicted as the yellow skin Kamara. This <br />brotherhood formed the Chola Empire and was fighting against the <br />Buddhist State of Sri Langka. During the fighting, Lakshana was <br />portrayed to be withdrawn and reluctant to fight against Ravana, the <br />ruler of Sri Langka. The epic ends with the fall of Ravana and the <br />reunification back between Rama and Sita. If the epic does not stop <br />there and is allowed to continues we shall see that Ravana will be <br />resuscitate and this time Rama would be in trouble as his brother <br />Lakshana would join the Ravana clan in the end. </p>
