</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>I have a very very basic question haunting me for a long time. Was<br />India Aryanized. I started reading the book "History of South India" by<br />K.N Sastry and he has written that South India was Aryanized from 1000<br />B.C to 400 B.C. Also in my school days we have read that Aryans as such<br />were not Indians and they came from Central Asia / Europe. How true is<br />this Theory? If these people came from central Asia and Europe, why<br />isn't there any trace of these people today in those places.</p>
<p>Quite a few people have refuted this theory of Aryans and this is a<br />theory very much formulated by Lord McCaulay to create a feeling of<br />division among Indians.</p>
<p><a href="http://encyclopediaofauthentichinduism.org/articles/34_the_fiction_of.ht" title="http://encyclopediaofauthentichinduism.org/articles/34_the_fiction_of.ht">http://encyclopediaofauthentichinduism.org/articles/34_the_fiction_of.ht</a><br />m</p>
<p>This article states that the concept of Aryan itself is a myth. Could<br />anybody please throw some light on this??</p>

        <p>Dear Sridevi</p>
<p>I think the basic confusion here is the timeframe.....</p>
<p>The aryanisation took place in 2000-1500 BC....there is enough historic and archeological evedence for that...</p>
<p>The aryans were initially nomads and settled in india they did not have idol worship which they adopted...yes their vedas were written may be in india but they did communicate to their native origins that why it explians why people in asia minor know baout these vedas and verses...</p>
<p>What you are forgetting is between then and noe there have been so many invasions and changes in mankind.....alexanders invasion...the persian invasion what was once a glorious civilisation of mesopotomia and persia is only a memory today because of spread of Islam.....</p>
<p>will you deny the fact that mesopotomian civilisation was not in iraq just because no one can understand the language and script today.....same for egypt</p>
<p>you are totally confusing historic migration with current evedence</p>

        <p>Dear Vijay<br />very interesting but historic and archeaological evidence point to the opposite...<br />I am not sure about the vedas but there is enough reference to arya vamsam in mahabarat etc</p>
<p>Yes there would be DNA assocaitions but I am not sure there are any fossils unearthed from the Indus valley sites</p>
<p>as for as the calssical language status for tamil that is a political issue...there is a chair for tamil in the language studies department and most western universities i doubt if the same could be said of most North Indian universities.</p>
<p>If you see the language tree of Indo European languages you will see greek as an offshoot of the main trunk</p>
<p>When I wrote the mail I meant mordern european languages but was surprised to find greek in it</p>

        <p>Shanmugam,</p>
<p>You understood the sentence but not the meaning. I<br />meant was eventhough that was possible, kings before<br />rajaraja didn't have the idea of writting<br />'meikeerthi'. I know that 'meikeerthi' was written by<br />Rajaraja I. Likewise eventhough Aryans got victory<br />over dravidians they didnt have idea of writting that.</p>
<p>I can give you another example, after several years<br />of the invention of paper only 'newspaper' idea came<br />into existance. </p>

<p>  Hi all,</p>
<p>  I am totally tired of such mails from some people<br />  in this group. They always 'accurates the<br />  approximations'.<br />  Some people may call me as a 'leftist'.</p>
<p>  I didn't mean that aryans embraced hinduism from<br />  dravidians. what I meant was dravidians had an<br />  unnamed<br />  religion and aryans had an vedic religion. Aryans<br />  formed the hinduism by mixing unnamed dravidian's<br />  religion and their own vedic religion. </p>
<p>  Sridevi has said that vedas refer herbs of India.<br />  We use sugarcane. Do you know the origin of<br />  sugarcane.? findout. There are several references in<br />  tamil poems about sugarcane. But its not a native<br />  plant of Tamilnadu or India. Sri dont be 'one<br />  sided'.</p>
<p>  Coming to the analyze part, wherever we go we<br />  analyse. The moon, the sun, the sea....Its human<br />  mentality. </p>
<p>  She has also asked that how could they forgot<br />  central asia as it was their own land. ( I hope she<br />  will not ask registration certificate. ) I already<br />  told you that it took place several hundred years<br />  back. That time all human beings were uncivilized.<br />  Harappa and Mohanjadharo civilization is one of the<br />  oldest civilizations in the world. Then how come<br />  they<br />  can write that? ( remember that eventhough tamil<br />  kings<br />  were civilized, 'meikeerthi' was first released by<br />  Rajaraja. and land was first measured by kulothunga.<br />  Their precedors didnt think about these things. )</p>
<p>  I was talking about a theory. You are talking<br />  about<br />  own wishes and own concepts. Ohhhhhhh, I am tired of<br />  hearing these things... Ok, bye I am getting out of<br />  this group. Thanks everybody....</p>

<p>    Hi All</p>
<p>    Coming to God's matter<br />    Doesnt this means Aryans embraced Hinduism from<br />    Dravidians.</p>
<p>    Hinduism existed thousands of years ago in this<br />    ancient country from North to South.ppl modified<br />  the<br />    Gods of Hinduism and worshipped according to their<br />    wish.</p>
<p>    Vedas can never be written in 100 years.They are<br />  the<br />    result of experience of ppl over 1000 of years<br />    And most of Vedas NEVER refered to any country<br />    except<br />    India.Had they been from Central Asia, how come<br />  they<br />    forget totally about it?</p>
<p>    For example, mostly, watever herbs mentioned in<br />    Ayurveda were available only in India.It is becoz<br />    they<br />    had inhabited this land from time immemorial, they<br />    are<br />    able to analyze this land</p>
<p>    British, just to undermine our glorious heritage,<br />    tried to write off Aryans as nomads and vedic<br />    literature as nomad's literature.They are simply<br />    trying to divide us and it appears that it<br />  succeeded</p>
<p>    This Aryan theory is not a well-proven one.Yes, it<br />    existed before British.<br />    Its just a hypothesis. <br />    British gave much importance to it and succeeded<br />  in<br />    popularising it to further their motives.Since<br />  they<br />    were having half of the world in their rule and<br />  also<br />    that India was also under British, none challenged<br />    them</p>

<p>      Hi all,</p>
<p>      Is it possible to give proof for an incident<br />    that<br />      took place before BC? Some theories will not<br />  have<br />      proof and we have to accept that according to<br />  our<br />      knowledge.</p>
<p>      Thiruvalluvar lived just before 2030( appr. )<br />      years. According to vikram's sentences that time<br />      this<br />      nation was already aryanized. So we should not<br />    refer<br />      Thirukkural.</p>
<p>      As Ramayana and Mahabharatha are the<br />  extensions<br />      of<br />      Aryan culture, if you refer these, then its like<br />      seeing from 'aryan arena'.</p>
<p>      Coming to the Gods' matter , all Gods are not<br />    came<br />      from Aryan culture. They mingled the local Gods<br />    with<br />      their own Gods and stories.</p>
<p>      For example, Pasupathi is an Dravidian God,<br />  and<br />      was<br />      worshiped by dravidians before the arrival of<br />      aryans.<br />      Then they rename that God as Shiva. Likewise<br />      dravidians had a God called Thirumal. Aryans<br />  named<br />      that God as Vishnu and extended the stories of<br />    Rama<br />      and Krishna. According to one theory these<br />  people<br />      were<br />      Aryan kings like Raja raja chola and others. As<br />  in<br />      olden days, kings were treated as 'Avathar of<br />  God'<br />      and<br />      they became real Gods.</p>
<p>      Accoding to one theory, dravidians lived near<br />      Harappa and Mohandharo ( now a days north india<br />    and<br />      Pakistan ) and Aryas came from Central Asia and<br />    when<br />      they met there was a clash between them. In that<br />      clash<br />      that civilization was ruined and dravidians came<br />      back<br />      to southindia. After that the aryans slowly came<br />      into<br />      entire india and established their culture<br />  without<br />      war.</p>
<p>      These things did not take place in a single<br />  day.<br />      It<br />      took several hundred years. If realize that,<br />  then<br />      you<br />      can understand that. This is mostly - world wide</p>

        <p>Dear Sridhar,<br />If there are Lithuanians and Ukranians who can recite Yajur Veda like we<br />do Thirukkural, then why shouldn't people from India migrated to those<br />Central Asian countries rather than the reverse happening?<br />If Sanskrit is the mother of all European languages, then again the same<br />question arises. Why shouldn't people from India migrated to those<br />central Asian places. <br />No where in the Vedas there is a mention of the word "Aryan". </p>
<p>Are there any genetic connections between the so called Aryans and the<br />Lithuanians. I believe the DNA will have similar strands even after<br />1000s of years. Am I right??</p>
<p>Also Sanskrit can't be the mother of all European languages. I had<br />read an article that Greek is a classical language and for a language to<br />be declared as a classical one, it should have been developed on its own<br />structure and vocabulary and no influence from other languages. Sanskrit<br />is the only Classical Indian language and even though Thamizh is proven<br />to be a language developed on its own, the govt. hasn't yet granted it a<br />classical status.</p>

        <p>Hi Sridar</p>
<p>Its really very intresting to hear this..<br />Then it seems that Atharvana veda and Yajur Veda must<br />have been with Aryans before they are supposed to come<br />India</p>
<p>I have a doubt<br />But doesnt this contradict the Vedic dates which they<br />give?they say Rig Veda is composed during 2nd<br />millinium BC after post-Aryan Invasion(rig veda is the<br />oldest veda..atharvana is written much later than it)<br />Mostly, western scholars claim that vedic period<br />post-dates Indus valley civilization</p>
<p>What are the views of others</p>

<p>  Dear Sri</p>
<p>  There are lithuanians and ukranians who recite the<br />  yajur veda and atharvana veda like we recite<br />  thirukural.... a few of our junior medical staff are<br />  from central asia and we were astonished to hear all<br />  this</p>
<p>  so there is some truth to aryan historic migration..</p>
<p>  its not the british even Hitler was a strong<br />  believer in the aryan migration theory and he<br />  thought they were the superior race..that is why he<br />  eliminated the jews and gypsies.....</p>
<p>  dont forget the british were godless pagans<br />  (uncivilised people) in comparision to the<br />  europeans...</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am totally tired of such mails from some people<br />in this group. They always 'accurates the<br />approximations'.<br />Some people may call me as a 'leftist'.</p>
<p>I didn't mean that aryans embraced hinduism from<br />dravidians. what I meant was dravidians had an unnamed<br />religion and aryans had an vedic religion. Aryans<br />formed the hinduism by mixing unnamed dravidian's<br />religion and their own vedic religion. </p>
<p>Sridevi has said that vedas refer herbs of India.<br />We use sugarcane. Do you know the origin of<br />sugarcane.? findout. There are several references in<br />tamil poems about sugarcane. But its not a native<br />plant of Tamilnadu or India. Sri dont be 'one sided'.</p>
<p>Coming to the analyze part, wherever we go we<br />analyse. The moon, the sun, the sea....Its human<br />mentality. </p>
<p>She has also asked that how could they forgot<br />central asia as it was their own land. ( I hope she<br />will not ask registration certificate. ) I already<br />told you that it took place several hundred years<br />back. That time all human beings were uncivilized.<br />Harappa and Mohanjadharo civilization is one of the<br />oldest civilizations in the world. Then how come they<br />can write that? ( remember that eventhough tamil kings<br />were civilized, 'meikeerthi' was first released by<br />Rajaraja. and land was first measured by kulothunga.<br />Their precedors didnt think about these things. )</p>
<p>I was talking about a theory. You are talking about<br />own wishes and own concepts. Ohhhhhhh, I am tired of<br />hearing these things... Ok, bye I am getting out of<br />this group. Thanks everybody....</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi All</p>
<p>  Coming to God's matter<br />  Doesnt this means Aryans embraced Hinduism from<br />  Dravidians.</p>
<p>  Hinduism existed thousands of years ago in this<br />  ancient country from North to South.ppl modified the<br />  Gods of Hinduism and worshipped according to their<br />  wish.</p>
<p>  Vedas can never be written in 100 years.They are the<br />  result of experience of ppl over 1000 of years<br />  And most of Vedas NEVER refered to any country<br />  except<br />  India.Had they been from Central Asia, how come they<br />  forget totally about it?</p>
<p>  For example, mostly, watever herbs mentioned in<br />  Ayurveda were available only in India.It is becoz<br />  they<br />  had inhabited this land from time immemorial, they<br />  are<br />  able to analyze this land</p>
<p>  British, just to undermine our glorious heritage,<br />  tried to write off Aryans as nomads and vedic<br />  literature as nomad's literature.They are simply<br />  trying to divide us and it appears that it succeeded</p>
<p>  This Aryan theory is not a well-proven one.Yes, it<br />  existed before British.<br />  Its just a hypothesis. <br />  British gave much importance to it and succeeded in<br />  popularising it to further their motives.Since they<br />  were having half of the world in their rule and also<br />  that India was also under British, none challenged<br />  them</p>

<p>    Hi all,</p>
<p>    Is it possible to give proof for an incident<br />  that<br />    took place before BC? Some theories will not have<br />    proof and we have to accept that according to our<br />    knowledge.</p>
<p>    Thiruvalluvar lived just before 2030( appr. )<br />    years. According to vikram's sentences that time<br />    this<br />    nation was already aryanized. So we should not<br />  refer<br />    Thirukkural.</p>
<p>    As Ramayana and Mahabharatha are the extensions<br />    of<br />    Aryan culture, if you refer these, then its like<br />    seeing from 'aryan arena'.</p>
<p>    Coming to the Gods' matter , all Gods are not<br />  came<br />    from Aryan culture. They mingled the local Gods<br />  with<br />    their own Gods and stories.</p>
<p>    For example, Pasupathi is an Dravidian God, and<br />    was<br />    worshiped by dravidians before the arrival of<br />    aryans.<br />    Then they rename that God as Shiva. Likewise<br />    dravidians had a God called Thirumal. Aryans named<br />    that God as Vishnu and extended the stories of<br />  Rama<br />    and Krishna. According to one theory these people<br />    were<br />    Aryan kings like Raja raja chola and others. As in<br />    olden days, kings were treated as 'Avathar of God'<br />    and<br />    they became real Gods.</p>
<p>    Accoding to one theory, dravidians lived near<br />    Harappa and Mohandharo ( now a days north india<br />  and<br />    Pakistan ) and Aryas came from Central Asia and<br />  when<br />    they met there was a clash between them. In that<br />    clash<br />    that civilization was ruined and dravidians came<br />    back<br />    to southindia. After that the aryans slowly came<br />    into<br />    entire india and established their culture without<br />    war.</p>
<p>    These things did not take place in a single day.<br />    It<br />    took several hundred years. If realize that, then<br />    you<br />    can understand that. This is mostly - world wide<br />    accepted theory.</p>
<p>    This is not given in that theory. This is my own<br />    opinion : As Sanskrit is their own language (<br />  what<br />    they spoke when they were in Central asia ), they<br />    dont<br />    want to let it die. So (unintentionally -<br />    unknowingly)<br />    they love and say that as a devine language and<br />  try<br />    to<br />    keep that in existance in anyway( Thaan<br />  adavittalum<br />    than sathai aadum? ). Its like even after<br />    settled-down<br />    in America/Britain we celebrate Pongal as we dont<br />    want<br />    to give-up our own culture fully. </p>
<p>    Coming to Color of Gods, Some 'Vaithega<br />  Madangal'<br />    not yet accepted some Gods and Godess in Tamilnadu<br />  (<br />    One famous Godess also in that list ). I dont want<br />    to<br />    say that explicitly.</p>
<p>    These Aryan - dravidian theory exists even<br />  before<br />    the period of British. So its childish to blame<br />  them<br />    in this matter.</p>

I started reading the book<br />      "History<br />        of South India" by<br />        K.N Sastry and he has written that South India<br />    was<br />        Aryanized from 1000<br />        B.C to 400 B.C. Also in my school days we have<br />      read<br />        that Aryans as such<br />        were not Indians and they came from Central<br />  Asia<br />    /<br />        Europe. How true is<br />        this Theory? If these people came from central<br />      Asia<br />        and Europe, why<br />        isn't there any trace of these people today in<br />      those<br />        places.</p>

        <p>Its nice to hear that atleast one person who<br />speaks according to almost accepted and somewhat<br />believable arguements. If sanskrit is the native<br />language of India why its not spoken by the people.</p>
<p>If it is really a devine language, how come<br />ordinary people happened to know that. do they<br />indirectly mean that they are superior?</p>
<p>Ok, we accept that sanskrit as a devine language.<br />Then they have no communication problem with god. Why<br />cant they ask god to stop tragdies like 'kumbakonam'<br />events?</p>
<p>I personally respect all languages. But one should<br />not dominate other languages in the name of god. Its<br />like cheating and insulting other languages.</p>

        <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am totally tired of such mails from some people<br />in this group. They always 'accurates the<br />approximations'.<br />Some people may call me as a 'leftist'.</p>
<p>I didn't mean that aryans embraced hinduism from<br />dravidians. what I meant was dravidians had an unnamed<br />religion and aryans had an vedic religion. Aryans<br />formed the hinduism by mixing unnamed dravidian's<br />religion and their own vedic religion. </p>
<p>Sridevi has said that vedas refer herbs of India.<br />We use sugarcane. Do you know the origin of<br />sugarcane.? findout. There are several references in<br />tamil poems about sugarcane. But its not a native<br />plant of Tamilnadu or India. Sri dont be 'one sided'.</p>
<p>Coming to the analyze part, wherever we go we<br />analyse. The moon, the sun, the sea....Its human<br />mentality. </p>
<p>She has also asked that how could they forgot<br />central asia as it was their own land. ( I hope she<br />will not ask registration certificate. ) I already<br />told you that it took place several hundred years<br />back. That time all human beings were uncivilized.<br />Harappa and Mohanjadharo civilization is one of the<br />oldest civilizations in the world. Then how come they<br />can write that? ( remember that eventhough tamil kings<br />were civilized, 'meikeerthi' was first released by<br />Rajaraja. and land was first measured by kulothunga.<br />Their precedors didnt think about these things. )</p>
<p>I was talking about a theory. You are talking about<br />own wishes and own concepts. Ohhhhhhh, I am tired of<br />hearing these things... Ok, bye I am getting out of<br />this group. Thanks everybody....</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi All</p>
<p>  Coming to God's matter<br />  Doesnt this means Aryans embraced Hinduism from<br />  Dravidians.</p>
<p>  Hinduism existed thousands of years ago in this<br />  ancient country from North to South.ppl modified the<br />  Gods of Hinduism and worshipped according to their<br />  wish.</p>
<p>  Vedas can never be written in 100 years.They are the<br />  result of experience of ppl over 1000 of years<br />  And most of Vedas NEVER refered to any country<br />  except<br />  India.Had they been from Central Asia, how come they<br />  forget totally about it?</p>
<p>  For example, mostly, watever herbs mentioned in<br />  Ayurveda were available only in India.It is becoz<br />  they<br />  had inhabited this land from time immemorial, they<br />  are<br />  able to analyze this land</p>
<p>  British, just to undermine our glorious heritage,<br />  tried to write off Aryans as nomads and vedic<br />  literature as nomad's literature.They are simply<br />  trying to divide us and it appears that it succeeded</p>
<p>  This Aryan theory is not a well-proven one.Yes, it<br />  existed before British.<br />  Its just a hypothesis. <br />  British gave much importance to it and succeeded in<br />  popularising it to further their motives.Since they<br />  were having half of the world in their rule and also<br />  that India was also under British, none challenged<br />  them</p>

<p>    Hi all,</p>
<p>    Is it possible to give proof for an incident<br />  that<br />    took place before BC? Some theories will not have<br />    proof and we have to accept that according to our<br />    knowledge.</p>
<p>    Thiruvalluvar lived just before 2030( appr. )<br />    years. According to vikram's sentences that time<br />    this<br />    nation was already aryanized. So we should not<br />  refer<br />    Thirukkural.</p>
<p>    As Ramayana and Mahabharatha are the extensions<br />    of<br />    Aryan culture, if you refer these, then its like<br />    seeing from 'aryan arena'.</p>
<p>    Coming to the Gods' matter , all Gods are not<br />  came<br />    from Aryan culture. They mingled the local Gods<br />  with<br />    their own Gods and stories.</p>
<p>    For example, Pasupathi is an Dravidian God, and<br />    was<br />    worshiped by dravidians before the arrival of<br />    aryans.<br />    Then they rename that God as Shiva. Likewise<br />    dravidians had a God called Thirumal. Aryans named<br />    that God as Vishnu and extended the stories of<br />  Rama<br />    and Krishna. According to one theory these people<br />    were<br />    Aryan kings like Raja raja chola and others. As in<br />    olden days, kings were treated as 'Avathar of God'<br />    and<br />    they became real Gods.</p>
<p>    Accoding to one theory, dravidians lived near<br />    Harappa and Mohandharo ( now a days north india<br />  and<br />    Pakistan ) and Aryas came from Central Asia and<br />  when<br />    they met there was a clash between them. In that<br />    clash<br />    that civilization was ruined and dravidians came<br />    back<br />    to southindia. After that the aryans slowly came<br />    into<br />    entire india and established their culture without<br />    war.</p>
<p>    These things did not take place in a single day.<br />    It<br />    took several hundred years. If realize that, then<br />    you<br />    can understand that. This is mostly - world wide<br />    accepted theory.</p>
<p>    This is not given in that theory. This is my own<br />    opinion : As Sanskrit is their own language (<br />  what<br />    they spoke when they were in Central asia ), they<br />    dont<br />    want to let it die. So (unintentionally -<br />    unknowingly)<br />    they love and say that as a devine language and<br />  try<br />    to<br />    keep that in existance in anyway( Thaan<br />  adavittalum<br />    than sathai aadum? ). Its like even after<br />    settled-down<br />    in America/Britain we celebrate Pongal as we dont<br />    want<br />    to give-up our own culture fully. </p>
<p>    Coming to Color of Gods, Some 'Vaithega<br />  Madangal'<br />    not yet accepted some Gods and Godess in Tamilnadu<br />  (<br />    One famous Godess also in that list ). I dont want<br />    to<br />    say that explicitly.</p>
<p>    These Aryan - dravidian theory exists even<br />  before<br />    the period of British. So its childish to blame<br />  them<br />    in this matter.</p>

<p>      I think this Aryan Invasion theory was created<br />  by<br />      British to defend themselves</p>
<p>      1. even in the oldest of Tamil literature like<br />      Thriukural, we find references to Hindu<br />    Gods(Aryan).</p>
<p>      2.If u take Mahabaratha, u have reference to<br />    Pandya<br />      Kings.<br />      3.Light-skinned and dark-skinned is not a<br />  matter.<br />      Krishna is represented as a dark skinned<br />  ,Godesss<br />      Parvathi/Kali is dark-skinned and so are<br />      Arjun,Draupadi etc.In many families, it is<br />    possible<br />      that people are dark-skinned.</p>
<p>      Yes, if Aryans came from Central Asia, is there<br />    any<br />      proof or aracheaological evidence?</p>
<p>      What are the views of others?</p>

<p>        I have a very very basic question haunting me<br />    for<br />      a<br />        long time. Was<br />        India Aryanized. I started reading the book<br />      "History<br />        of South India" by<br />        K.N Sastry and he has written that South India<br />    was<br />        Aryanized from 1000<br />        B.C to 400 B.C. Also in my school days we have<br />      read<br />        that Aryans as such<br />        were not Indians and they came from Central<br />  Asia<br />    /<br />        Europe. How true is<br />        this Theory? If these people came from central<br />      Asia<br />        and Europe, why<br />        isn't there any trace of these people today in<br />      those<br />        places.</p>

<div style='background-color:' <P <SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma" I have one doubt about this theory. In all our literatures or our puranas we never had any mention of people having any&nbsp;clash with some other race. Supposing, a war&nbsp;happened which pushed dravidians to the south, it is strange it&nbsp;finds no mention of any sort&nbsp;(ok..ok..as far as i know).&nbsp;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" / <o:p </o:p </SPAN </P <br /><P <SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma" Look at this way&#133;. Say Sanskrit is the native language of Aryans when they were in central &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" / <st1:place w:st="on" asia</st1:place  (refer rajkumar&#146;s mail). Any culture would take pride in mentioning the victory they have achieved in their literature. Again no mention of any victories in Upanishads. Only victories that were mentioned are those against asuraas. But asuraas were conquerors in these stories and not defenders. <o:p </o:p </SPAN </P <br /></p><P Arul<BR <BR </P <BR <BR <BR <br /><DIV &nbsp;</DIV &gt;From: sri &lt;sridevi_cs@yahoo.com&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com &gt;To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a> &gt;Subject: Re: [ponniyinselvan] re:Was India really Aryanized???? &gt;Date: Tue, 31 Aug 2004 00:58:07 -0700 (PDT) &gt;MIME-Version: 1.0 &gt;X-Sender: <a href="mailto:sridevi_cs@yahoo.com">sridevi_cs@yahoo.com</a> &gt;Received: from n23.grp.scd.yahoo.com ([66.218.66.79]) by mc3-f12.hotmail.com with Microsoft SMTPSVC(5.0.2195.6824); Tue, 31 Aug 2004 00:59:13 -0700 &gt;Received: from [66.218.66.31] by n23.grp.scd.yahoo.com with NNFMP; 31 Aug 2004 07:58:24 -0000 &gt;Received: (qmail 33822 invoked from network); 31 Aug 2004 07:58:19 -0000 &gt;Received: from unknown (66.218.66.217) by m25.grp.scd.yahoo.com with QMQP; 31 Aug 2004 07:58:19 -0000 &gt;Received: from unknown (HELO web53510.mail.yahoo.com) (206.190.37.71) by mta2.grp.scd.yahoo.com with SMTP; 31 Aug 2004 07:58:19 -0000 &gt;Received: from [213.207.131.194] by web53510.mail.yahoo.com via HTTP; Tue, 31 Aug 2004 00:58:07 PDT &gt;X-Message-Info: JGTYoYF78jHPc4nSLYqt7AmoFKEDaUq3 &gt;X-Yahoo-Newman-Property: groups-email &gt;X-Apparently-To: <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a> &gt;Message-ID: &lt;20040831075808.95510.qmail@web53510.mail.yahoo.com&gt; &gt;In-Reply-To: &lt;20040831065425.42665.qmail@web50806.mail.yahoo.com&gt; &gt;X-eGroups-Remote-IP: 206.190.37.71 &gt;X-Yahoo-Profile: sridevi_cs &gt;Mailing-List: list ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com; contact <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan-owner@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan-owner@yahoogroups.com</a> &gt;Delivered-To: mailing list <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a> &gt;Precedence: bulk &gt;List-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:ponniyinselvan-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com&gt; &gt;Return-Path: sentto-6248931-4614-1093939103-arulprasads=hotmail.com@returns.groups.yahoo.com &gt;X-OriginalArrivalTime: 31 Aug 2004 07:59:13.0127 (UTC) FILETIME=[67863F70:01C48F30] &gt; &gt;Hi All &gt; &gt;Coming to God's matter &gt;Doesnt this means Aryans embraced Hinduism from &gt;Dravidians. &gt; &gt;Hinduism existed thousands of years ago in this &gt;ancient country from North to South.ppl modified the &gt;Gods of Hinduism and worshipped according to their &gt;wish. &gt; &gt;Vedas can never be written in 100 years.They are the &gt;result of experience of ppl over 1000 of years &gt;And most of Vedas NEVER refered to any country except &gt;India.Had they been from Central Asia, how come they &gt;forget totally about it? &gt; &gt;For example, mostly, watever herbs mentioned in &gt;Ayurveda were available only in India.It is becoz they &gt;had inhabited this land from time immemorial, they are &gt;able to analyze this land &gt; &gt;British, just to undermine our glorious heritage, &gt;tried to write off Aryans as nomads and vedic &gt;literature as nomad's literature.They are simply &gt;trying to divide us and it appears that it succeeded &gt; &gt;This Aryan theory is not a well-proven one.Yes, it &gt;existed before British. &gt;Its just a hypothesis. &gt;British gave much importance to it and succeeded in &gt;popularising it to further their motives.Since they &gt;were having half of the world in their rule and also &gt;that India was also under British, none challenged &gt;them &gt; &gt; &gt;--- raj kumar &lt;elangojana@yahoo.com&gt; wrote: &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible to give proof for an incident that &gt; &gt; took place before BC?

I started reading the book &gt; &gt; &gt; "History &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of South India" by &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; K.N Sastry and he has written that South India &gt; &gt; was &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aryanized from 1000 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; B.C to 400 B.C. Also in my school days we have &gt; &gt; &gt; read &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that Aryans as such &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were not Indians and they came from Central Asia &gt; &gt; / &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Europe. How true is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this Theory? If these people came from central &gt; &gt; &gt; Asia &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Europe, why &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isn't there any trace of these people today in &gt; &gt; &gt; those &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; places. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Quite a few people have refuted this theory of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aryans and this is a &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theory very much formulated by Lord McCaulay to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; create a feeling of &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; division among Indians. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;http://encyclopediaofauthentichinduism.org/articles/34_the_fiction_of.ht &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; m &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This article states that the concept of Aryan &gt; &gt; &gt; itself &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a myth.

          Was India really Aryanized????        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Is it possible to give proof for an incident that<br />took place before BC? Some theories will not have<br />proof and we have to accept that according to our<br />knowledge.</p>
<p>Thiruvalluvar lived just before 2030( appr. )<br />years. According to vikram's sentences that time this<br />nation was already aryanized. So we should not refer<br />Thirukkural.</p>
<p>As Ramayana and Mahabharatha are the extensions of<br />Aryan culture, if you refer these, then its like<br />seeing from 'aryan arena'.</p>
<p>Coming to the Gods' matter , all Gods are not came<br />from Aryan culture. They mingled the local Gods with<br />their own Gods and stories.</p>
<p>For example, Pasupathi is an Dravidian God, and was<br />worshiped by dravidians before the arrival of aryans.<br />Then they rename that God as Shiva. Likewise<br />dravidians had a God called Thirumal. Aryans named<br />that God as Vishnu and extended the stories of Rama<br />and Krishna. According to one theory these people were<br />Aryan kings like Raja raja chola and others. As in<br />olden days, kings were treated as 'Avathar of God' and<br />they became real Gods.</p>
<p>Accoding to one theory, dravidians lived near<br />Harappa and Mohandharo ( now a days north india and<br />Pakistan ) and Aryas came from Central Asia and when<br />they met there was a clash between them. In that clash<br />that civilization was ruined and dravidians came back<br />to southindia. After that the aryans slowly came into<br />entire india and established their culture without<br />war.</p>
<p>These things did not take place in a single day. It<br />took several hundred years. If realize that, then you<br />can understand that. This is mostly - world wide<br />accepted theory.</p>
<p>This is not given in that theory. This is my own<br />opinion : As Sanskrit is their own language ( what<br />they spoke when they were in Central asia ), they dont<br />want to let it die. So (unintentionally - unknowingly)<br />they love and say that as a devine language and try to<br />keep that in existance in anyway( Thaan adavittalum<br />than sathai aadum? ). Its like even after settled-down<br />in America/Britain we celebrate Pongal as we dont want<br />to give-up our own culture fully. </p>
<p>Coming to Color of Gods, Some 'Vaithega Madangal'<br />not yet accepted some Gods and Godess in Tamilnadu (<br />One famous Godess also in that list ). I dont want to<br />say that explicitly.</p>
<p>These Aryan - dravidian theory exists even before<br />the period of British. So its childish to blame them<br />in this matter.</p>
