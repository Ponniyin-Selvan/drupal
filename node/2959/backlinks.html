<p>Subramanian Swaminathan <sswami99@gmail.com  wrote:</p>
<p>Dear Friends</p>
<p>I thought I could share with you what I am planning to do next. I would like to work on Mahabalipuram. Let me explain why. If the matter is not interesting to you, just click 'DELETE'. I can assure you that you would have lost nothing. I don't expect every one would share my interests. </p>
<p>I did an extensive study of Ajanta. The objective was two-fold. One to satisfy my curiosity, and the other, which became a passion for me later, to take such heritage sites to common people. </p>
<p>When I had completed work on Ajanta to some respectable level, I was due for retirement. Around that time I was planning to take up a detailed documentation of my native district, Pudukkottai. That I did get a golden opportunity, which I botched up is a different matter. During all these period one that was always in my mind was Mahabalipuram, though in between I was infatuated by Darasuram also. </p>
<p>Now as I have shifted to Chennai, the most logical would be to concentrate on Mahabalipuram. The choice is clear. It was in my original agenda nd aathe site is so near. I thought that it may be useful to explain, at least for me, why Mahabalipuram attracts me. </p>
<p>First it is the Pallava grace. There is something which makes the Pallava sculptures irresistible. The Cholas might have been grander. But the dainty Pallava monuments are great aesthetic pleasure. History of Tamil temple architecture, that is what is physically available to us, starts with the Pallavas and the Pandyas. Both wrought their master pieces on hard granite, a feat never attempted after Asoka did in Bihar. Then, right on their very first attempt the Pallavas produced unexcelled art. We have no trace of their experimentation. Can the craft-persons drawn from the nearest trades, carpenters, masons, ivory carvers and jewellers be equal to the task? Obviously they were, as we see their output. This is a good reason for my interest in the Pallavas. </p>
<p>Then, why Mahabalipuram? Isn't Mahabalipuram is one-stop shop for the Pallava's plastic art? The entire gamut of temple architecture you see within walking distance: the cave-temples (oh, of such a variety), the monoliths (the pioneering effort), open-<acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym bas-relief (never attempted by others before or after) and structural temples! Cave-temples are no great big deal, Asoka started this almost a millennium before. The arch-rival of the Pallavas, the Chalukyas, beat them at the post; they excavated cave-temples a few decades before the Kanchi dynasty. But, undoubtedly monoliths are the Pallava's unmatched contribution to the world of art. There had been a few who took inspiration, like the Rashtrakutas, whose Kailasanatha at Ellora art extraordinary. But, the open-<acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym bas reliefs, like the Arjuna's Penance, could not even be attempted! The Pallava contribution to temple architecture is exceptional, and Mahabalipuram is their museum! </p>
<p>OK, all these would interest morons like me. What about normal people? Fortunately there is enough masala in Mahabalipuram for all kinds of taste. It abounds mysteries. How did Mamallapuram become Mahabalipuram, is not too exciting. But one would definitely like to know why all most all the monuments are left unfinished. We are reminded of the Tiruppati barber story. Pardon me for this blasphemer humour! </p>
<p>Why did they choose Mahabalipuram, I would like to know. It was a flourishing port for ages is not sufficient reason. The scraggy hillocks and scant vegetation do not make the place quite attractive. Nor is that close to the capital, Kanchi, by the contemporary standard. Then why? I would like to know. </p>
<p>There is confusion in the names, strewn all over. Leave alone the name of the place, whose original name after the great Pallava warrior king, Mamalla. Why call the stone (monolith) temples rathas? They don't move. And they are dedicated to the traditional Hindu gods, and have no relation with the Mahabharata heros. Actually there is no justification what so ever except that there are five monuments. The marvel of a bas-relief, the largest in the world, is a great puzzle. The protagonists of Arjuna and of Bhagiratha are equally convincing in their arguments. </p>
<p>Who among the Pallavas were the authors of the monuments is still an unsettled question. You may now pitch in; God knows you may come up with another plausible theory, the 'n' plus oneth, to add to the confusion! The arguments forwarded by various experts remind me of the Perry Mason mysteries, how every character comes out with a cogent story who the killer was! </p>
<p>Mahendra Pallava initiated excavating cave-temples in the Tamil country and temple building was continued vigorously by his descendents. As we can imagine the earliest ones must simple in concept and in execution. Thus one can follow the development of temple architecture through the degree of sophistication. Pillar, we are told, is a very important distinguishing feature. You can see that the Mahendra's were simple, whereas the successors bought in progressive improvements. But what do you do if two different kinds of pillar are found in the same cave temple? Sculpture is another discriminator. Again we are perplexed. One expects progressing refinement. But the Tiruchy Gangadhara of Mahendra, one of the earliest sculptures, is a master piece. </p>
<p>To confound the matter, the Pallava kings had decorated themselves with a number of title giving clues to the penchant for this among the modern leaders! Unfortunately many are common to multiple kings. Some later raja made changes in the structure and inscribed his name on it. Some even took credit, actually appropriated, for some of these monuments without contributing to it! After all even the royalty, that prided itself as descendants of Bharadwaja, suffered from human frailties! </p>
<p>There was also vandalism! The sectarian feud, between the Saivaits and the Vaishavaits did incalculable harm. An over-anxious saivaite Pallava king attempted some crude modifications to some Vishnu shrines it looks. But when the Vaishanavite zealots appropriated some temples some of the great works of art, in addition to their being objects of worship, have been mutilated or obliterated. I couldn't believe this. </p>
<p>Do you know that most of thee Mahabalipuram sculptures have mutilated nose? What happened? Some say that the conquering Chalukyas did it. All these make a painful reading, nevertheless fascinating studying human weakness. </p>
<p>We have references to Mahabalipuram, or for that matter, a great port in the location where we find Mahabalipuram today from the beginning of the Christian era. The interest on the monuments dates from the coming of the Westerners. It looks the same story every where. We made them, worshipped in them, forgotten them and allowed then to disintegrate! It isn't a happy story. We have references to citing Seven pagodas in the early mariners' notes. What are these Pagadas? Most likely the temples like the Shore Temple. Where there seven of them, for we can see the spires of the two of the Shore Temple? There is a popular belief that most of them were swallowed by the sea. But from all our records the Shore Temple was all the time there on the Shore. The local people also believe a huge township is under water. It activated people like Graham Hancock, who has been searching for forgotten civilisations, and he along with the Indian National Institute of Oceanography and the Scientific<br />Exploration Society, UK made joint exploration. The team claim that there is a submerged city covering a few square kilometers. Tsumai last year seem to have unearthed (literally) some structures, and this generated considerable excitement. The <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  has even reported citing a Sangam age temple. This is very important, for our history of temple architecture could be pushed back by 600 years. But, we shall wait and watch. Once sedate, <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  has now become sensational! You may recollect the fanfare with which the finding of Brahmi inscription in Adichanallur was announced as belonging to the 5 th century BC? There is no news further on this path-breaking announcement.</p>
<p>The major part of the period under discussion, 7 th-9th centuries, was a period of great religious significance. It is the bhakti era. During this period there occurred two movements which altered the course of Indian cultural and religious history. Both these emanated from the South. One was the Bhakti cult initiated by the Shaivaite Tamil saints </p>
<p>to take deep roots in the country - carried on by Jayadeva, Chaitanya, Tukaram, Mira and others. Mahendra Pallava was influenced by none other than Appar, to return to the Hindu-fold. It is a rare instance in history where a faith was driven out by poetry! And Bhutattazhvar was born in Mahabalipuram. </p>
<p>The second was remarkable, not only because of its impact, but also because it was the work of a single man. Adi Shankara must have been an extraordinary genius. He set about reviving Hinduism - of a rather special intellectual kind. He traveled all over India and wherever he went he triumphed but he was a conqueror of the mind and in intellectual argument. He became a great leader of the intellectual class and at the same time caught the imagination of the masses. Quite surprisingly, the Mahabalipuran shrines, which seems to be a great achievement for us, left no impact on the saints. Only Vishnu, in the form of Anantasayanam, in the Shore Temple complex was sung by an Azhvar. We are not able to understand. </p>
<p>Mahabalipuram's connection with literature is must have been colourful, but there is very little of reference to the town, let alone the great art treasure it houses. (Kanchi at that time was one of the greatest cities. The Pallavas were great patrons of art and literature. Their court was studded with literary luminaries. Mahendra was himself a multifaceted personality. Dandi, the author of Kavyadarsa ('Morror on Poetry'), an authoritative treatise on poetics, upon which the vast history of Sanskrit poetics rests, has adorned the court of Mamalla and his grand-son, Parameswara. There is a work attributed to Dandi, Avantisundara katha, the only Sanskrit literary text making mention of Mahabalipuram. Again surprising. </p>
<p>There is suggestion by at least two authors to get out of the conundrum of the Great penance bas-relief. The solution seems to me very clever. According to them the authors meant a slesha (siledai, in Tamil), that it means both of them at the same time. To imagine the author of the Great Penance to resort to such tricks is great excitement. He was capable of this. Hasn't he wrought something original, actually two, the monoliths and the bas-relief? We may remember that in the contemporary literary world such tricks were 'in-things'. The Pallava court poet Dandin, author of kavyadarsa, has also composed, now lost but for one stanza, a two-in-one kavya, dvi-samdhana-kavya. Significantly, Dandin's Ragahva-Pandaviya is a bitexual narration, the same text capable of being read in two different ways, of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. </p>
<p>The very fact that most of the monuments are unfinished, let me also add, in various stages of incompletion, would help us study the very process of temple architecture. In fact one can consider this as graded tutorials! </p>
<p>The list is long. I shall now venture into how we can present the Mahabalipuram monuments to the public. Before that what the monuments offer is worth looking at. </p>
<p>In my opinion Mahabalipuram offers excellent scope for literature suitable to various age groups. </p>
<p>a picture book, mostly pictures, with very little text, for children <br />a picture book on the Amar Chitra Katha model <br />an excellent tourist guide<br />an audio tourist guide<br />a monograph<br />an interactive CD<br />a series of presentation materials for schools, and finally, <br />regular residential camps on art appreciation. </p>
<p>These are the suggestions from my limited understanding of the subject and still limited originality. Others may come up with more useful, fruitful and clever ideas. I am ready to join. </p>
