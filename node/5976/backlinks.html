<p>then thought whether we can ask the same question to our members. If<br />possible, we can restrict to history books, but I wouldn't.</p>
<p>Request members to just post the book names, we can discuss the merit<br />and de-merits of author or books in seperate thread if required, which<br />would keep the thread in focus.</p>
<p>I was influenced by Balakumaran's writings, though it is difficult to<br />mention one book, I can clearly remember these books.</p>
<p>1. "Kanavugal Virpavan" by Balakumaran<br />2. "Sathya Sodhanai" tamil translation by Gandhi.</p>
<p>When it comes to History books, none other than</p>
<p>1. Ponniyin Selvan by Kalki</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>A.K Chettiar was primarily a traveller.<br />knowing few languages e trotted across the globe sometimes shovelling <br />coal to pay for his voyage.<br />but then like the great travellers of the past he paused to record <br />each step.</p>

<blockquote><p>  AK Chettiar's 'Annalin Adichuvatil' is a travelogue/experiences of <br />  him trying to get footage for the documentry on Gandhi he was <br />  making. Amazing book and the tenacity of the man is just <br />  unbelievable. This is currently in print by Kalachuvadu(who BTW are <br />  doing a great job in publishing a lot of books in their classics <br />  series). The restored documentry itself was screened in last year's <br />  chennai book fair by Kalachuvadu.</p>

<p>    SPS, I remember reading a great book on Kasturiba Gandhi, <br />  translated inot tamil by AK Chettiar, a long time ago (the original <br />  was hindi or gujarati, i don't know). Ba as she was fondly called <br />in <br />  some ways is deserving of even more respect than Gandhi. <br />    ?<br />    AK Chettiar was a less?known?but very well travelled old <br />  man/author?- wrote travelogues like Manian and spoke around 12 <br />  different languages. In his last years he was a frequent figure at <br />  old book stores in Chennai, including the famous pavement Azhvar <br />  kadai.<br />    ?<br />    Malathi</p>

<p>    Dear Satish,</p>
<p>    getiing up early does not matter much...</p>
<p>    How do we spend our time ..</p>
<p>    towards personal (including family ) benefits ..</p>
<p>    towards common : social - religeous - cultural causes ..</p>
<p>    towards upliftment of one' self..</p>
<p>    and selflessly cutting across caste - regional - linguistic <br />    barriers..</p>
<p>    As Head of the Family - as an employer in an Organisation most of <br />    ones commitments are demanding enormous attention !</p>
<p>    Remember the story : Naradhar forgot to utter " Narayana" when <br />  given <br />    a cup of ghee and was asked to bring back without spilling it !</p>
<p>    Without harming others if we are able to be some support to <br />  persons <br />    comparable below our life-style, it is enough to begin with..</p>
<p>    I remember (Actor) Parthiban having said (years back) when <br />  attended <br />    a function with (his wife) Sita ::</p>
<p>    At home, she talks and I listen..</p>
<p>    On the dias, I talk and all (including her ) listen .. !</p>
<p>    We have never listened to Kasturiba ! - with due respects to <br />    Gandhiji!</p>

<p>      Satish you can perhaps take some hope from people like me, I <br />    can&#39;t stir before 7 am workdays. Not talking at all abt <br />    holidays. But I have no issues with late nights.

        <p><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym Chettiar's 'Annalin Adichuvatil' is a travelogue/experiences of <br />him trying to get footage for the documentry on Gandhi he was <br />making. Amazing book and the tenacity of the man is just <br />unbelievable. This is currently in print by Kalachuvadu(who BTW are <br />doing a great job in publishing a lot of books in their classics <br />series). The restored documentry itself was screened in last year's <br />chennai book fair by Kalachuvadu.</acronym></p>

<p>  Dear Satish,</p>
<p>  getiing up early does not matter much...</p>
<p>  How do we spend our time ..</p>
<p>  towards personal (including family ) benefits ..</p>
<p>  towards common : social - religeous - cultural causes ..</p>
<p>  towards upliftment of one' self..</p>
<p>  and selflessly cutting across caste - regional - linguistic <br />  barriers..</p>
<p>  As Head of the Family - as an employer in an Organisation most of <br />  ones commitments are demanding enormous attention !</p>
<p>  Remember the story : Naradhar forgot to utter " Narayana" when <br />given <br />  a cup of ghee and was asked to bring back without spilling it !</p>
<p>  Without harming others if we are able to be some support to <br />persons <br />  comparable below our life-style, it is enough to begin with..</p>
<p>  I remember (Actor) Parthiban having said (years back) when <br />attended <br />  a function with (his wife) Sita ::</p>
<p>  At home, she talks and I listen..</p>
<p>  On the dias, I talk and all (including her ) listen .. !</p>
<p>  We have never listened to Kasturiba ! - with due respects to <br />  Gandhiji!</p>

          The Books That Changed Your Lives        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>SPS, I remember reading a great book on Kasturiba Gandhi, translated inot tamil by <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym Chettiar, a long time ago (the original was hindi or gujarati, idon't know). Ba as she was fondly called in some ways is deserving of evenmore respect than Gandhi. <br />?<br /><acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym Chettiar was a less?known?but very well travelled old man/author?-wrote travelogues like Manian and spoke around 12 different languages. In his last years he was a frequent figure at old book stores in Chennai, including the famous pavement Azhvar kadai.<br />?<br />Malathi</acronym></acronym></p>

<p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>getiing up early does not matter much...</p>
<p>How do we spend our time ..</p>
<p>towards personal (including family ) benefits ..</p>
<p>towards common : social - religeous - cultural causes ..</p>
<p>towards upliftment of one' self..</p>
<p>and selflessly cutting across caste - regional - linguistic <br />barriers..</p>
<p>As Head of the Family - as an employer in an Organisation most of <br />ones commitments are demanding enormous attention !</p>
<p>Remember the story : Naradhar forgot to utter " Narayana" when given <br />a cup of ghee and was asked to bring back without spilling it !</p>
<p>Without harming others if we are able to be some support to persons <br />comparable below our life-style, it is enough to begin with..</p>
<p>I remember (Actor) Parthiban having said (years back) when attended <br />a function with (his wife) Sita ::</p>
<p>At home, she talks and I listen..</p>
<p>On the dias, I talk and all (including her ) listen .. !</p>
<p>We have never listened to Kasturiba ! - with due respects to <br />Gandhiji!</p>

<p>anyway, thanks for the encouring words. I never gave and still hope<br />that someday i will make it.. :)</p>
<p>And,coming back to the thread.. Malathi and Venkat were talking about<br />Bharathi and Kalki..</p>
<p>If I am correct, Bharathi did write some poems/articles in favour of<br />the brits. atleast I know of a poem written to welcome the prince of<br />wales (? I am not sure). Probably such work of him might led people<br />like Kalki to criticize him thinking that he is not a patriot.</p>

<p>  Sathish, if you feel humiliated, then probably you are half way, there<br />  is a saying which goes like this. "Don't count the number of failures,<br />  if you failed n times, then you have tried n times by raising from<br />  failure again and again, that is what counts".</p>

        <p>ok. As this thread moving away from the original intention, let me<br />throw my 2 cents as well.</p>
<p>Sathish, if you feel humiliated, then probably you are half way, there<br />is a saying which goes like this. "Don't count the number of failures,<br />if you failed n times, then you have tried n times by raising from<br />failure again and again, that is what counts".</p>
<p>Keep trying, all you need is a motivation which require you to do some<br />thing you you are passionate about.</p>
<p>Keep trying<br />Thiru</p>

This is when I think I <br />read the Musketeers and 'Pride and Prejudice' (I have about 4-5 <br />editions of the book and 3-4 DVDs of the different adaptations). If <br />there is going to be one novel that I want to take it to my grave, <br />it will be P&amp;P (Sorry <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  fans!). Followed by all Austen and Dumas's <br />works and then discovered Wilde (I mean, I still read 'The <br />importance of being Earnest' whenever I am down) followed by Kafka <br />(odd, but there was a Tamil translation I read which led me to the <br />surrealists), Camus, Proust, Satre etc and got bored of the lot and <br />dumped. Meanwhile read Thi.Ja and started buying more of Thi.Ja and <br />La.Sa.Ra and their ilk. I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  when in 8th standard but still <br />consider 'Ivan Hoe' to be a much better historical romance any day <br />(Thats me and dont jump on it). More discoveries in English <br />literature and Su.Ra, Jeyamohan, Nila.Padmanabhan, A. Madhavan and <br />others in Tamil. Even ran a small literary magazine while in <br />college. <br />Earning money made me getting books easy and having been in US for <br />most of the last 12 years changed nothing. When we decided to settle <br />back in Chennai, I sent one box full of books and carried one more <br />32" suitcase full of books to here. Now trying to find a way to <br />consolidate my book shelfs as they are overflowing now.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>And hey, thanx for giving the way for a completely narcissistic post <br />and I thoroughly enjoyed it!</p>

        <p>Malati,</p>
<p>This book (Notes to myself) I read when I going through a tough phase. Very<br />good book and it had an impact in my life. My suggestion is that every one<br />should read it atleast once.</p>
<p>On the lighter side every one (Youngsters) should read Sujatha's Pirivom<br />Sandhipom ... I am sure I will be in the receiving end after this mail. But<br />I read that at the age and felt very nice. I wont say that it changed my<br />life but it had an impact ...</p>

<p>Cant help but express my sour taste after reading the alchemist - it was<br />a nice moral, but the story was just a 'javvu'. It was as if the author had<br />to write so many pages to publish the book. well, opinions differ ;)</p>

<p>  Jonanthan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach - I think the first book<br />  I read in one sitting (till date never broke that record). And his<br />  Illusions..</p>

<p>  Paulo Choelo's 'Alchemist' - the crux of finding happiness.</p>

        <p>Hi Balaji,</p>
<p>If Kalki's novels made you feel proud as a tamilian, you should read<br />chadilyan's kadal pura - it elates one to feel proud of our ancestor's might<br />and influence - the conquests of rajendra chola and the reasons behind them<br />made me equate cholas to the US of today - a world power.</p>
<p>As a natural continuation, it also made me want to read Jayankondar's<br />kalingathuparani. But havent done that yet ;)</p>

<p>  my wife is fan of kalki and he was introduced to me a few years<br />  back. honestly all along was more obsessed with english novels.</p>
<p>  after reading kalkis triology (SS, Ponniyin selvan and Parthiban<br />  Kanavu) iam proudly calling myself a thamizhan. the above three<br />  changed not only outlook but also my tastes and preferences in life.</p>
<p>  now iam consiouly speaking with everybody only in thamizh (thooya<br />  thamizh...) with AMMANI being the only word for addressing females.</p>
<p>  The other book which has helped me realise more about myself is THE<br />  BHAGAVAD GITA.</p>

<p>    well, I should add that the change was not just because of ponniyin<br />  selvan -<br />    the book, but because it got me into ponniyin selvan - this group,<br />  and it<br />    was the group that changed my outlook on life.</p>

<p>      If the question is what got me interested in reading, I cant but<br />  admit,<br />      gokulam, chandamama and siruvar malar - of course amar chitra<br />  katha - my<br />      scientific inspiration stems from amar chitra katha's book on<br />  einstien.</p>
<p>      A lot more of novels in english have influenced me, but the book<br />  that<br />      changed my life was ponniyin selvan - it brought out to light how<br />  much I<br />      love the tamil culture (not indian - tamil specifically) and<br />  changed my<br />      habits from:</p>
<p>      - work, work, work, pub, movies, fun</p>
<p>      to</p>
<p>      - work, historical interest and serious introspection of our<br />  society,<br />      spending my free time on more useful activities (guess thats the<br />  difference<br />      between a hobby and timepass), paying more attention to my family</p>
<p>      If you understand what I mean, thats a serious change.</p>

          The Books That Changed Your Lives        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Good topic.</p>
<p>Book changed my life?? I can say books that influenced me or the ones<br />I like, but cant say anything that changed my life (for that matter<br />only Madan US has said <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  changed his life...rest all.. we share our<br />books of interest I think).</acronym></p>
<p>As VK said, Poonthalir and Gokulam had a lot of influence during my<br />childhood. lots of morals and mythological stories to cherish.</p>
<p>Jonanthan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach - I think the first book<br />I read in one sitting (till date never broke that record). And his<br />Illusions..</p>
<p>Ofcourse <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  - after reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  I was so obsessed that for nearly 5<br />years I didnt read any English novels. Later came out of my cocoon<br />thinking that I am only loosing if I stick only to tamil historical<br />novels.</acronym></p>
<p>Paulo Choelo's 'Alchemist' - the crux of finding happiness. </p>
<p>I was bowled by 'Freedom at Midnight' and cried a lot while reading<br />it. (till date I feel humiliated by Nehru's words '6 hours of sleep is<br />necessity, 7 hours is luxury').</p>

          The Books That Changed Your Lives        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Really very very interesting topic!</p>
<p>Hope from which we can prepare a great list of books and authors!!</p>
<p>The first ever book made a big impact in my life is Ennangalai<br />MEmbaduthungal by Copmeyar it's a tamil translated version book which I<br />read! There are so many things in that book which will guide us in our day<br />to day life and will teach us to control &amp; utilize our thoughts. When I was<br />in college I read <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  first and addicted to Kalki's writings then I started<br />reading his other books like <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym , <acronym title="Parthiban Kanavu" PK</acronym  and Alai Osai.</p>
<p>The ultimate turning point in my life happened at when I joined this <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym <br />group, I learned a lot through this group and moreover its guiding me<br />towards history, Tamil literature, temples, Sculptures, etc.,!!</acronym></p>
<p>In english novels the interesting one's are Clive Cussler's - Valhalla<br />rising, Tom clancy's - The executive order, The Red october and Dan Brown's<br />- The Da vinci code, Angels and Demons, The digital fortress and the The<br />deception point.</p>
<p>The list is endless....</p>
<p>Especially I was very much ispired by our Vijay kumar's postings in this<br />group as well as in Min Tamil group. Earlier I used to got to temple only<br />for worship, but now I started seeing the sculptures, though I couldnt<br />understand its configuration, style, specials etc., I am very much confident<br />that I will learn slowly. If I can't learn here in this group I can never<br />learn! Also I started taking photos of temples, I will post it temple by<br />temple in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satheesh kumar R</p></acronym></acronym></p>

        <p>Venkat, yes you are right about RD. I came to know though after coming to US that it is not held in such high regard here as in India. The reason as Iunderstand is getting credit from bits and pieces of other books and also the organisation's forays into evangelism and lottery.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Hi<br />Mine was (though not a book) the readers digest.<br />i laid my hands on a out dated copy and was fascinated at the variety.<br />how articles used to jump from action to social workers, from travel <br />to health issues, from crime to humour.<br />it was a treat to the brain.<br />i didnt get a single word in the " word power"<br />understood half the jokes in laughter the best medicine , none in the <br />humour in uniform.<br />i managed to read the condensed book in the end. it was about hitlers <br />architect-albert speer " the devils architect."<br />but then i went on to subsribe as well as colect the old ones.<br />i had a complete collection from 1955 onwards. some sent to me from <br />people abroad.<br />finally i gave up the entire collection to a school library.<br />in big way i think the 'readers digest' has shaped me.<br />venketesh</p>

        <p>Dear Shoba, I liked Lakshmi very much too although I felt she became stereotyped in later years. She was a medical doctor, an MD and a novelist as well!!<br />?<br />Have you read Latsiyavaadhi, it is one of my favorites of hers. Also Kanjanayin Kanavu?<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>For me books that initiated me into reading were Devan's Thuppariyum Sambu (both chitra kathai &amp; text version), Miss Janaki, Sriman Sudarsanam. I've liked all Lakshmi's novels- learnt about life led by people of that era. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is always no.1 in the list of books that are read repeatedly&amp; Anbin Ellai the second.<br />English Sherlockholmes always a favorite, James Herriot 'cos of my love foranimals,?other fictions like to read but forget soon.<br />Shobha<br />--- On Sun, 6/29/08, chandramouli <mailmouli_27@ yahoo.co. in  wrote:</p>

<p>Paalangal - a really good work of Sivashankari- showed the generation<br />gaps beautifully.</p>
<p>For me, i would say novels like Lakshmi Kadaksham, Srimathi<br />Mythili,Mithila Vilas, anbin ellai, premaharam, Sriman Sudharsanam<br />helped change my pereception towards many things inherent in life as<br />such. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  re-kindled the urge in me to delve into South Indian history.</p>

<p>Hi, iam balaji or nkb and am a day old baby to this group.</p>
<p>proud to be part of a very rich thought provoking group.</p>
<p>my wife is fan of kalki and he was introduced to me a few years <br />back. honestly all along was more obsessed with english novels.</p>
<p>after reading kalkis triology (<acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym , Ponniyin selvan and Parthiban <br />Kanavu) iam proudly calling myself a thamizhan. the above three <br />changed not only outlook but also my tastes and preferences in life.</acronym></p>
<p>now iam consiouly speaking with everybody only in thamizh (thooya <br />thamizh...) with AMMANI being the only word for addressing females.</p>
<p>The other book which has helped me realise more about myself is THE <br />BHAGAVAD GITA.</p>

          The Books That Changed Your Lives        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My reading habits started with "Muthu Comics" during my school days <br />and I was facinated by the stories of "Irumbukkai Mayavi", "Lawrence <br />&amp; David", "Mugamuudi Vethalar", "Cisco/Pancho" etc., etc., and that <br />still continues. I'm still a reader of those comics and preserve <br />quite a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of them till date.</p>
<p>My father had a collection of hard bound serials from Kumudam, Ananda <br />Viketan etc., from 50's and 60's. I used to read them for the jokes <br />especially "Washingtanil Kalyanam." Some bound volumes were Maniyans <br />and I was too young to read anything from it.</p>
<p>When I was in 8th standard, I went to my granny's place for the <br />annual vacation and to keep me not bored, my aunty told me <br />the "sivakamiyin sabatham" story, few chapters a day... The story <br />influenced me a lot. I didnt understand all the affairs between the <br />prince and Sivakami ( or may be she avoided material not suitable for <br />my age ) , but the deeds of Paranjothi and the secret of Ajantha cave <br />paintings kept me interesting.</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>During my +2 vacation, I found a hard bound original Kumudam series <br />of "Mannan Mahal" by Sandilyan. Good drawings by Sagar brought the <br />characters alive. Except for the last few chapters, the book was <br />intact and I read it in one sitting. That was the first historic <br />novel I ever read.</p>
<p>Then in college, I bought all the Sandilyan novels and became a fan <br />of him...</p>
<p>Then one guy told me about Kalki's greatness and said that the hero <br />will not even touch the hands of the heroin in Kalki's novels. If he <br />ever touches, it was for a promise. This was something like a "pure" <br />form of love for me... So I wanted to read Kalki's novels and read <br />more about this kind of love that was platonic.</p>
<p>That was a time, when Kalki's books weren't at print. There were a <br />few copies in the university library, but they were locked <br />permanently by some research scholars.</p>
<p>And one friend offered me to give a bound book from Kalki magazines <br />for reading, 1 at a time, to be returned intact within a week and not <br />to be given to anyone including my siblings. The deal was that I have <br />to give him 1 "Moore" cigerette per volume. This was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  expensive <br />for me and I had to starve myself to get the volumes... but the <br />result is history...</acronym></p>
<p>My quest for books still continues and I have spent lot of my <br />fortunes on books of any sort....</p>

        <p>well, I should add that the change was not just because of ponniyin selvan -<br />the book, but because it got me into ponniyin selvan - this group, and it<br />was the group that changed my outlook on life.</p>

        <p>For me books that initiated me into reading were Devan's Thuppariyum Sambu (both chitra kathai &amp; text version), Miss Janaki, Sriman Sudarsanam. I've liked all Lakshmi's novels- learnt about life led by people of that era. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  is always no.1 in the list of books that are read repeatedly&amp; Anbin Ellai the second.<br />English Sherlockholmes always a favorite, James Herriot 'cos of my love foranimals,?other fictions like to read but forget soon.<br />Shobha<br />--- On Sun, 6/29/08, chandramouli <mailmouli_27@yahoo.co.in  wrote:</p>

<p>Paalangal - a really good work of Sivashankari- showed the generation<br />gaps beautifully.</p>
<p>For me, i would say novels like Lakshmi Kadaksham, Srimathi<br />Mythili,Mithila Vilas, anbin ellai, premaharam, Sriman Sudharsanam<br />helped change my pereception towards many things inherent in life as<br />such. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  re-kindled the urge in me to delve into South Indian history.</p>

        <p>Paalangal - a really good work of Sivashankari- showed the generation<br />gaps beautifully.</p>
<p>For me, i would say novels like Lakshmi Kadaksham, Srimathi<br />Mythili,Mithila Vilas, anbin ellai, premaharam, Sriman Sudharsanam<br />helped change my pereception towards many things inherent in life as<br />such. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  re-kindled the urge in me to delve into South Indian history.</p>

        <p>Hi<br />Mine was (though not a book) the readers digest.<br />i laid my hands on a out dated copy and was fascinated at the variety.<br />how articles used to jump from action to social workers, from travel <br />to health issues, from crime to humour.<br />it was a treat to the brain.<br />i didnt get a single word in the " word power"<br />understood half the jokes in laughter the best medicine , none in the <br />humour in uniform.<br />i managed to read the condensed book in the end. it was about hitlers <br />architect-albert speer " the devils architect."<br />but then i went on to subsribe as well as colect the old ones.<br />i had a complete collection from 1955 onwards. some sent to me from <br />people abroad.<br />finally i gave up the entire collection to a school library.<br />in big way i think the 'readers digest' has shaped me.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>Thiru, very good subject. To me a few books (there were many) that changed my life were - <br />1 Thi Ja's Mogamul (we had a thread on this already)<br />2 Manian's many travelogues (inspiration to travel and see other cultures)<br />3 Sujatha's Karayellam Chenbagapoo (Inspiration for new ways of writing mysteries and thrillers on par with western novelists)<br />4 Sivasankari's Paalangal (women based subject on balancing generation gaps, also very reminiscent of my grandmother's childhoood)<br />5 Last but not the least Amarar Kalki's Sivagamiyim Sabatham (yet to read another novel that really brought out so much emotion, I am a woman but really not into love stories or soft romantic subjects, but <acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham" SS</acronym  made even men feel emotions around true love, unrealisation of dreams and dedication to ideals..could write a few volumes on this.))<br />?<br />Malathi</acronym></p>
