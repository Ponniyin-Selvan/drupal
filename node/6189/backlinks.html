<blockquote><p>  ?<br />  The actions of the Mahabharat therefore led to more bad karma, not<br />less. And sometimes it is really clueless what God/Krishna was doing</p></blockquote>
<p>then. There is one out of the ordinary explanation that I have read<br />somewhere that analysed Krishna's life and said that he was only<br />divine in parts - such as while saving Draupadi and while going on a<br />mission to stop the war. In others he was human like anyone and trying<br />to take advantage of the situation. Of course as Krishna devotees we<br />may not find this palatable.</p>
<blockquote><p>  ?<br />  Malathi</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>CHANGING THE SUBJECT to make it more relevant.</p>
<p>Malathi,</p>
<p>You are bowling me down every day. can you please enlighten me, on<br />what basis you say Mahabaratha led to more bad karma than Good? Any<br />references or its your interpretation? </p>
<p>When Krishna says, 'Sambavami yuge yuge', how can he lead to adharma<br />or bad karma? He says, whenever adharma increases he will come down to<br />protect dharma. Duryodhana may be a good king, but still he didnt keep<br />up his promise to return the land and did injustice to Pandavas.<br />Ravana was a sakalakala vallavan. only thing he slipped on is Sita.<br />Mahabali - still I dont know the reason why he was sent to padala<br />loka, when he is such a good ruler (due to his good deeds Indira's<br />simhasanam started shaking and thats why he goes to Vishu for<br />protection. Am i right?).</p>
<p>For the terrorist group,say for eg. viduthalai puligal - Dhanu is a<br />martyr. She is the epitome of sacrifice. Sivarasan was a hero, who did<br />great service to them. So police killing Sivarasan, do you term it<br />adharma or bad karma?</p>
<p>And Kauravas going to Heaven and Pandavas to hell - if I remember<br />correct, it was maya created by Krishna to test the pandavas<br />perseverance, dont remember the story fully, but surely later the maya<br />is relaxed and Pandavas goes to heaven and kauravas to hell.</p>
<p>Trivia - Just yesterday I was reading 'Practical vedanta' by Swami<br />Vivekanand. What i understand is, there is no mention of Hell in any<br />of our vedas. Only Purnas have reference to hell. Puranas, as we all<br />know is latter addition, with history mixed with lots of myth and<br />flavour. Vedas talk only about Heaven and returning to earth after the<br />good karma is over, because as per vedas taking birth itself is the<br />highest punishment.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

<p>Hi Kathie<br />bears have their fair share of hindu mythology<br />Jambavan is a bear in Hinduism and believe to lived from Krita Yuga <br />to Dvapara Yuga. He is also considered King of bears and first son of <br />Brahma, before humans were created.<br />Jambavantha also acquired a gem called Syamantaka( perhaps the later <br />day kohinoor) jambavan was also krishna's father in law. <br />jambavan is a important charecter in the siege of lanka, so must be <br />in many ramayana panels.</p>

          Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Venkatesh / Malathi,</p>
<p>I think the discussion is going towards 'NirGuNa Brahman' <br />and 'SaGuNa Brahman' - Brahman without and with form/attributes.</p>
<p>Most of the scriptures describe Brahman as the Supreme (omniscient, <br />omnipotent, omnipresent) without form but capable of taking any form.</p>
<p>As <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym  rightly says, the seeker follows the path that is most suited <br />to him.</acronym></p>
<p>The above ideas are not mine - just expressions of what I came to <br />read by flipping through some books on this topic.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />V...<br />--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "vinjamoor_venkatesh" <br /><vinjamoor_venkatesh@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Dear Malathi (Hope you are happy now!!!)</p>
<p>  Call it Supreme Being or Supreme Energy - (thamar ugandhadhu eppEr <br />  maRRappEr - Poigai Azhwar)<br />  Call it as existant or non-existant - (uLan alan enil avan aruvam -</p>
<p>  Nammazhwar)</p>
<p>  This is the beauty of Hinduism. But pathetically, the Hinduism <br />that <br />  we see today is not what it was, as correctly pointed out by Vijay <br />  earlier.</p>
<p>  Personally, I dont see any difference between the Brahman that you <br />  stated and the Supreme Being that I quoted, except the language <br />  difference. I would say, whatever you name it, if the character of <br />  what you call as Brahman matches with that of the Supreme Being <br />that <br />  I said, they are all one and the same. Only that, you call it <br />  as "energy" and stop there. But when I try to attach a form to it, <br />  remember that a form without energy is nothing. So even my <br />  visualised God is having all the energy that you stated for the <br />  Brahman.</p>
<p>  This is where the harmony of Hinduism lies. You call the God by <br />all <br />  names and yet they all finally point out to only one. And most <br />  importantly this God is full of Mercy and is Easy to Attain <br />although <br />  He is the Master. More logical definition of God isn't it?</p>

<p>    Dear Venkat (please if you dont' mind can you drop 'Smt' makes <br />me <br />  feel old),<br />    ?<br />    I understand what you say on Thenkalai philosphy and I am no <br />  expert on Vaishnavite philosphies myself. However, I disagree that <br />  the commonality in Shaivaite and Vaishnavite philosphies and also <br />  beauty of hinduism lies in 'supreme being', yes that is one <br />  perspective. There is also the perspective of Brahman which is <br />more <br />  on the lines of Supreme Energy rather than a big boss/supreme <br />being. <br />  Buddhism indirectly refers to the same Brahman although it does <br />not <br />  give it a form even as a non entity.<br />    ?<br />    The Brahman is not a boss however benevolent we may want him to <br />  be. It is experiential energy as experienced by great saints such <br />as <br />  Ramana, Ramakrishna and so many others. Also as expounded by JK <br />and <br />  other non religious philosphers. The beauty of the energy is that <br />it <br />  is experiential even with a little effort with dyana/meditation <br />and <br />  therefore demands little effort on the part of the believer.Since <br />  that energy is part of all of us it is refered to as 'Aham <br />  Brahmasmi'.<br />    ?<br />    Malathi</p></dmaloo@></p></blockquote>

        <p>Dear <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym ,</p>
<p>There is logic in the Azhwars siding with Valmiki more on the story. I <br />think most of the Azhwars belong to a period before Kamba Raamayana. <br />Kambar is said to be a contemporary of Ottakkoothar and Kulothunga <br />Chozha. Azhwars have been there before Shri Raamaanuja's time - even <br />before RajaRajaChola's time - refer Kalki quoting Azhwar Paasurams <br />through Azhwarkkadiyaan in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym .</p>
<p>When it comes to belief, Azhwars (and Nayanmaars) belong to the so-<br />called Bhakthi cult. So their belief in Sharanaagathi and 'Ellaam Avan <br />Seyal' would definitely override the concept of 'Free-Will'.</p>
<p>Kambar is also a proponent of Bhakthi. He writes Raamaayana more as a <br />devotional poem - people say he refers to Shri Raama as an Avataara at <br />every available juncture, as against Vaalmiki who sets out to write <br />the story of a complete man, a 'Poorana-Purusha' or a 'Maryada-<br />Purushottam'. (I have read neither Vaalmiki nor Kamban in full - but <br />have read a few articles about them. Notable among them is CHO's <br />comments in his 'Vaalmiki Raamaayanam').</p>

<p>  For the story line, Azhwars side with Valmiki's version more. But <br />  when it comes to singing about the Tamizhar marabu, Azhwars and <br />  Kamban takes the same side. In fact, even Kamban renounces the <br />  concept of Free Will, just like Azhwars. I dont know the exact <br />  verses. But I heard my teacher saying this. I am yet to get into <br />  Kamba Ramayanam. So it may take some time to give quote from Kamban <br />  verses.</p>

        <p>Gopi, we have talked at length abt Periyar/EVR/DK/DMK before. It remains a hugely controversial issue. To me it is so primarly because of the unadultered stance that dubs all believers fools/muttaals (which happens to be 95% of the world!! and includes me too :))). I truly recognize what EVR did forwomen's rights and rights of the poor/downtrodden, so do several other people.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>  Thanks for the link Satish, I was looking for a good Kamba <br />Ramayana link for long.<br />  ?<br />  Yes it is true that Valmiki's epic was the original and all the <br />rest evolved out of it. Robert Goldman one of the oldest western </p></dmaloo@...></p></blockquote>
<p>scholars of the epic also writes that *most* of the epic seems to <br />have been written by a single author who is a man, there fore <br />Valmiki.</p>
<blockquote><p>  ?<br />  Kambar made it more palatable yes. In the process Kambar also <br />introduced morals and values of his generation which made the epic </p></blockquote>
<p>much more complex than the simple story it was and?more easy to <br />critique by DK/DMK ites. I have the greatest respect for Kambar's <br />poetry but to keep in mind both Kambar and Valmiki are not <br />historians, they are poets, and we have to give margin to that. </p>
<blockquote><p>  ?<br />  It is a good idea to avoid taking the Ramayana or the Mahabharata <br />literally and getting overtly sentimental over whether or not it is </p></blockquote>
<p>fact. First of all those of us who are keen on history should not be <br />very upset when it is not in line with our sentiments (including PS <br />itself). There are many parts of the RAmayana that are completely <br />unpalatable - we talked about the horse sacrifice once before. Paula <br />Richman, another modern day scholar, points out that Sita's fire <br />ordeal and the Uttara Ramayana clearly appear to be interpolations <br />(much to my delight, now I can keep my Rama and my feminist ideals <br />intact!!). My western educated 13 year old nephew wants to know how <br />and why the Mahabharat is any less violent than some of his video <br />games. I like to stick with Gandhi, that it was an anology to wars <br />of the mind. I dont' know anything better for him and happen to like <br />the Mahabharat very much.</p>

<p>  Deepak,</p>
<p>  You yourself said it is an interpretation. Interpretation are not<br />  original and hence its duplicate. I am great fan of Kamba <br />Ramayanam,<br />  though I have not read it. Just a glimpse of it made me to start<br />  loving tamil literature. So I have great regards for that.</p>
<p>  But we should accept that, Kambar, took the main story line and<br />  modified many a things, like characterization of many characters<br />  (Actually I should say polish). Kambars character might look much<br />  better that valmiki's, because valmiki gave things as is, where as<br />  Kambar polished it to make it more suitable for tamil literature.</p>
<p>  Though we can appreciate it, if we want to know ramayana as is, <br />then<br />  valmiki is THE source IMHO.</p>
<p>  PS : <a href="http://www.tamilhindu" title="www.tamilhindu">www.tamilhindu</a>. com has a series on Kamba Ramayanam, by<br />  Mr.Harikrishnan, who is an authority in both Valmiki and Kamba<br />  ramayanam. Those interested can read Kamba ramayanam with urai <br />both in<br />  english and tamil.</p>

<p>Dear Friends !<br />We must always use our intellectual prowess and test of <br />reasoning in studying and interepetting the religious as well as <br />great epics like Mahabharatham and Kambaramayanam. Even great <br />authors would be influenced by the times they lived in.Therefore it <br />is not just right to call Kambaramayanam by Kambar as duplicate <br />though Satish might not have intended it.His intention to call it as <br />duplicate would be that the same was sourced originally from Kavi <br />Valmiki's Ramayana. Moreover, with respect to criticism of the Epics <br />by DMK and DK people, We should accept them in right spirit in an <br />open, democratic society. Otherwise, we may land up in a <br />closed ,obscurantic society incapable of seeing what is right and <br />just and go by what is dished out by self serving knowledge <br />dispensers. <br />Though my background is from city based with rural experience,I <br />greatly appreciate the good work done by the Periyar EVR in <br />eradicating irrational and often unjust beliefs. His DK/DMK <br />followers actions were/are not exactly flattering and the open, <br />literate and equity based society will take care of their <br />excesses.Wish you all and raring to hear more from all.</p></dmaloo@...></p>

        <p>Dear Venkat, very nicely summarized!! Yes all Ramayanas have the same dharmic concept, good over evil although it can get pretty confusing at times. The concept of Ravana 'kidnapping' Sita when she is his daughter completely negates one of the basic morals of the story that desiring another man's wife is wrong. As for Rama and Sita being siblings and being married?less the said the better, personally I must admit I find that completley unpalatable regardless of what time and age it was.<br />?<br />Kambar did not take that type of odd deviations. Yes what you say is 100% true, that he tried tamil marabu and that example is a can of worms. I have serious issues with Kambar in that regard. Bascially like this, it is not Sita's or any woman's fault that a kidnapper touched her our of force. By introducing the guilt issue that it is sullied we not only guilt Sita (who was actually touched in Valmiki's story) we are assuming every innocent womanwho is violated is guilty. This is exactly why short sighted rationalists like some DKites jump on the issue and tear it to pieces. <br />?<br />Thanks<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Interpretation is a wrong word in my opinion.

<p>But onething for sure is that Ramayana has made a very deep impact in <br />many parts of South and South East Asia, that every one <br />started "localizing" it for their pleasures, just like a Remake <br />Movie. The pathetic part is some of those localisations had resulted <br />in complete deviation from the original, like the ones, where Sita <br />and Rama are said to be siblings or Sita is said to Ravana's daughter <br />etc. But all these variations, if analysed properly (I haven't done <br />it) will definitely bring out a common holding point faithful to the <br />original (hi)story line. In this case of Ramayana, this could be the <br />win of Dharmic forces over Adharmic forces.</p>
<p>The reason I said this is, the word "duplicate", to my opinion, <br />seemed to be too raw and was giving a very bad picture about Kamban. <br />As you know the usage of the word Duplicate is done to point out to a <br />very cheap replica of original.

<p>This is absolutely correct. Yes, Kamban has indeed tuned it in line <br />with the "pazhantamizhar marabu". This was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  different from the <br />ones followed in Northern India. So as rightly pointed by you, Kamban <br />wrote it to suit the views based on demographical variations. </acronym></p>
<p>For example, Ravana carrying Sita episode. Valimiki presents this as <br />Ravana, holding Sita's hands while pulling away. (Example of what <br />Satish told regarding Valmiki presenting it as it is) While Kamban, <br />portrays is saying that Ravana just took the entire piece of land in <br />which Sita and Ravana was standing. This was well in line with <br />Tamizhar Marabu where in a woman is not supposed to be touched by <br />anyone other than her husband. </p>
<p>Every such variations based on local customs and traditions is very <br />much present in Ramayana. </p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>valmiki and kamban have connections to madras.</p>
<p>no other place in india has an association with valmiki as <br />thiruvanmiyur which for 1300 years has a connection with the poet.<br />to my extent of knowledge there is a temple to valmiki only here till <br />today.<br />( i need to check up on the thevaram of thiruvanmiyur if the poet is <br />mentioned)</p>
<p>kamban on the other hand is associated with thiruvotriyur. when <br />kamban struck with a writer's cramp couldnt finish his book the <br />vattapaarai amman held a thipantham and lit his intellect .</p>
<p>madras is also associated with other luminarires in devotional and <br />literary field. kindly check up the ' madras nalla madras thread for <br />previous discussions.</p>

<p>Please note that it is your knowledge too. You might be just <br />repeating what Vivekananda said, but the moment you become one with <br />that knowledge (gnana) it is yours too. Knowledge is ever flowing <br />one. A stagnant knowledge is of no use. Vivekananda passed it on to <br />you (definitely through some other person or medium) and you are <br />passing on the same. And also Vivekananda had not invented it. He got <br />it from others before him, say, Ramakrishna and this, is a true <br />chain. A very strong chain.</p>

<p>    Dear Satish,</p>
<p>    I am a little confused here. When you say the Atma is Free, what <br />do <br />    you mean to say? Is it free from the Karmic Bondage or is it free <br />to <br />    act on its own.</p>
<p>    Apart from the above doubt, the other things what you have said <br />are <br />    very valid. And I am no expert. Just that my teacher taught me to <br />    question the rationale behind every claim, keeping aside the <br />    hagiologies and other mystic references. The moment we keep these <br />two <br />    aside, we start to analyise purely based on Logic only and this <br />is <br />    what is true rationality or Pagutharivu.</p>
<p>    With the statement that you have made below, even you are an <br />expert <br />    here Satish.</p>
<p>    =========Quote=============<br />      So whatever we feel/do, let it be free will or slavery, nothing<br />      is wrong as long as we try to move forward towards the ultimate<br />      sathya.<br />    ========Unquote============</p>
<p>    This is precisely what I said earlier as "avar avar vidhi vazhi <br />adaya <br />    ninRanarE" and "vaikuntham puguvadhu maNNavar vidhiyE"</p>
<p>    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>
<p>  Dear VV,</p>
<p>  When I say atma is free, it is free from everything..let it be <br />karmic<br />  bondage or will to act on its own. As the upanishads say, two birds <br />on<br />  the tree, one eating the fruit and other seeing it (adam eve story <br />is<br />  said to be based on this), the bird watching the other bird eating<br />  fruit is the atma and the bird that is eating the fruit is the 'I'.<br />  Only with the ego, we feel that we are doing things but actually if <br />we<br />  remove the 'I', there is no action done by atma. Gita says the same.<br />  Thats what we mean by saying, atma is no qualities. </p>
<p>  Only because we dont think that we are free, we are bonded. <br />Realizing<br />  that we are free is self realization. It that state, the self cannot<br />  do anything on its own. (people argue that if I am free I am <br />licensed<br />  to do whatever I like and so nothing is wrong, and does all the <br />wrong.<br />  This is explanantion for that arguement).</p>
<p>  And whatever I say, its not my gnana, its Swami Vivekananda's.... :)</p>

          Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>-The story of Rama has inspired great amounts of latter-day <br />literature in various languages, notable among which are the works of <br />the Tamil poet Kambar of the 13th century, Molla ramayanam in Telugu <br />and the 14th century Kannada poet Narahari Kavi's Torave <br />Ramayan,fifteenth century Bengali poet Krittibas Ojha, known as the <br />Krittivasi Ramayan and the sixteenth century Hindi poet Tulsidas. </p>
<p>other versions were based such as the Khmer Reamker, the Thai <br />Ramakien, the Lao Phra Lak Phra Lam the Malay Hikayat Seri Rama and <br />the Maranao Darengan.</p>
<p>from the wiki<br />-- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Ravi" <ravi_eds@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hi Malathi &amp; Satish</p>
<p>  The original is Ramayana itself. That was live, all others were<br />  comments based on the live relay.</p>
<p>  Valmiki got the first rights to the relay. Kamban, Tulsidas etc had<br />  second rights at other times, again direct telecasts only.</p>
<p>  Original is Rama's itself. Copy right belongs to Rama and not to<br />  Valmiki. Valmiki had the greatest privilege of getting the grant <br />from<br />  Lord himself.</p>
<p>  Ratnakar becomes Valmiki who infact 'documents' the ramayana. </p>
<p>  I will be taking of the grace which Lord gave to Alwars and others <br />if<br />  I say that they got the Ramayana based out of their studies from<br />  Valmiki's words.</p>
<p>  Beeshma recites Sahasranama on battle field, does it mean he is the<br />  owner of Sahasranama ? Ofcourse, only Beeshma was up in the level of<br />  getting the relay of Sahasranama.</p>
<p>  If you observe, he not only sees Lord in 1000 forms, he also hears<br />  (and relays) conversations of Lord Shiva and devas etc. The<br />  Sahasranama apparently, is live relay, if we tune ourselves to that<br />  level - we can also see/hear it...<br />  Ramayana and Mahabaratha did happen and.... did not happen also...<br />  purely depends on the intellectual level of the reader. Perfect<br />  example of saying deivam endral athu deivam. I believe they happened<br />  and are happening every time, the time here is the question of <br />eons...</p>
<p>  FYI:My Guru Arunagiri has written a lot of Ramayana scenes which I<br />  dont remember reading in some of the Ramayana versions. His visions<br />  are obviously not from any books. </p>

<p>    Thanks for the link Satish, I was looking for a good Kamba <br />Ramayana<br />  link for long.</p>
<p>    Yes it is true that Valmiki's epic was the original and all the <br />rest<br />  evolved out of it. Robert Goldman one of the oldest western scholars<br />  of the epic also writes that *most* of the epic seems to have been<br />  written by a single author who is a man, there fore Valmiki.</p>
<p>    Kambar made it more palatable yes. In the process Kambar also<br />  introduced morals and values of his generation which made the epic<br />  much more complex than the simple story it was and more easy to<br />  critique by DK/DMK ites. I have the greatest respect for Kambar's<br />  poetry but to keep in mind both Kambar and Valmiki are not <br />historians,<br />  they are poets, and we have to give margin to that. </p>
<p>    It is a good idea to avoid taking the Ramayana or the Mahabharata<br />  literally and getting overtly sentimental over whether or not it is<br />  fact. First of all those of us who are keen on history should not be<br />  very upset when it is not in line with our sentiments (including PS<br />  itself). There are many parts of the RAmayana that are completely<br />  unpalatable - we talked about the horse sacrifice once before. Paula<br />  Richman, another modern day scholar, points out that Sita's fire<br />  ordeal and the Uttara Ramayana clearly appear to be interpolations<br />  (much to my delight, now I can keep my Rama and my feminist ideals<br />  intact!!). My western educated 13 year old nephew wants to know how<br />  and why the Mahabharat is any less violent than some of his video<br />  games. I like to stick with Gandhi, that it was an anology to wars <br />of<br />  the mind. I dont' know anything better for him and happen to like <br />the<br />  Mahabharat very much.</p>

<p>    Deepak,</p>
<p>    You yourself said it is an interpretation. Interpretation are not<br />    original and hence its duplicate. I am great fan of Kamba <br />Ramayanam,<br />    though I have not read it. Just a glimpse of it made me to start<br />    loving tamil literature. So I have great regards for that.</p>
<p>    But we should accept that, Kambar, took the main story line and<br />    modified many a things, like characterization of many characters<br />    (Actually I should say polish). Kambars character might look much<br />    better that valmiki's, because valmiki gave things as is, where as<br />    Kambar polished it to make it more suitable for tamil literature.</p>
<p>    Though we can appreciate it, if we want to know ramayana as is, <br />then<br />    valmiki is THE source IMHO.</p>
<p>    PS : <a href="http://www.tamilhindu" title="www.tamilhindu">www.tamilhindu</a>. com has a series on Kamba Ramayanam, by<br />    Mr.Harikrishnan, who is an authority in both Valmiki and Kamba<br />    ramayanam. Those interested can read Kamba ramayanam with urai <br />both in<br />    english and tamil.</p>

<p>Dear Friends !<br />We must always use our intellectual prowess and test of <br />reasoning in studying and interepetting the religious as well as <br />great epics like Mahabharatham and Kambaramayanam. Even great <br />authors would be influenced by the times they lived in.Therefore it <br />is not just right to call Kambaramayanam by Kambar as duplicate <br />though Satish might not have intended it.His intention to call it as <br />duplicate would be that the same was sourced originally from Kavi <br />Valmiki's Ramayana. Moreover, with respect to criticism of the Epics <br />by DMK and DK people, We should accept them in right spirit in an <br />open, democratic society. Otherwise, we may land up in a <br />closed ,obscurantic society incapable of seeing what is right and <br />just and go by what is dished out by self serving knowledge <br />dispensers. <br />Though my background is from city based with rural experience,I <br />greatly appreciate the good work done by the Periyar EVR in <br />eradicating irrational and often unjust beliefs. His DK/DMK <br />followers actions were/are not exactly flattering and the open, <br />literate and equity based society will take care of their <br />excesses.Wish you all and raring to hear more from all.</p></dmaloo@...></p>

The wisdom behind what Rajaji clearly says as 'kadhai' is in fact appreciating the beauty of the epic without being concerned about whether it is factually true or not.

<p>Hi Malathi &amp; Satish</p>
<p>The original is Ramayana itself. That was live, all others were<br />comments based on the live relay.</p>
<p>Valmiki got the first rights to the relay. Kamban, Tulsidas etc had<br />second rights at other times, again direct telecasts only.</p>
<p>Original is Rama's itself. Copy right belongs to Rama and not to<br />Valmiki. Valmiki had the greatest privilege of getting the grant from<br />Lord himself.</p>
<p>Ratnakar becomes Valmiki who infact 'documents' the ramayana. </p>
<p>I will be taking of the grace which Lord gave to Alwars and others if<br />I say that they got the Ramayana based out of their studies from<br />Valmiki's words.</p>
<p>Beeshma recites Sahasranama on battle field, does it mean he is the<br />owner of Sahasranama ? Ofcourse, only Beeshma was up in the level of<br />getting the relay of Sahasranama.</p>
<p>If you observe, he not only sees Lord in 1000 forms, he also hears<br />(and relays) conversations of Lord Shiva and devas etc. The<br />Sahasranama apparently, is live relay, if we tune ourselves to that<br />level - we can also see/hear it...<br />Ramayana and Mahabaratha did happen and.... did not happen also...<br />purely depends on the intellectual level of the reader. Perfect<br />example of saying deivam endral athu deivam. I believe they happened<br />and are happening every time, the time here is the question of eons...</p>
<p>FYI:My Guru Arunagiri has written a lot of Ramayana scenes which I<br />dont remember reading in some of the Ramayana versions. His visions<br />are obviously not from any books. </p>
<p>again.... intha vaaram kuzappam vaaram :-)</p>

<p>  Thanks for the link Satish, I was looking for a good Kamba Ramayana<br />link for long.</p>

<p>of the epic also writes that *most* of the epic seems to have been<br />written by a single author who is a man, there fore Valmiki.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Kambar made it more palatable yes. In the process Kambar also<br />introduced morals and values of his generation which made the epic</p></blockquote>
<p>much more complex than the simple story it was and more easy to<br />critique by DK/DMK ites. I have the greatest respect for Kambar's<br />poetry but to keep in mind both Kambar and Valmiki are not historians,<br />they are poets, and we have to give margin to that. </p>
<blockquote><p>  It is a good idea to avoid taking the Ramayana or the Mahabharata<br />literally and getting overtly sentimental over whether or not it is</p></blockquote>
<p>fact. First of all those of us who are keen on history should not be<br />very upset when it is not in line with our sentiments (including PS<br />itself). There are many parts of the RAmayana that are completely<br />unpalatable - we talked about the horse sacrifice once before. Paula<br />Richman, another modern day scholar, points out that Sita's fire<br />ordeal and the Uttara Ramayana clearly appear to be interpolations<br />(much to my delight, now I can keep my Rama and my feminist ideals<br />intact!!). My western educated 13 year old nephew wants to know how<br />and why the Mahabharat is any less violent than some of his video<br />games. I like to stick with Gandhi, that it was an anology to wars of<br />the mind. I dont' know anything better for him and happen to like the<br />Mahabharat very much.</p>

<p>  Deepak,</p>
<p>  You yourself said it is an interpretation. Interpretation are not<br />  original and hence its duplicate. I am great fan of Kamba Ramayanam,<br />  though I have not read it. Just a glimpse of it made me to start<br />  loving tamil literature. So I have great regards for that.</p>
<p>  But we should accept that, Kambar, took the main story line and<br />  modified many a things, like characterization of many characters<br />  (Actually I should say polish). Kambars character might look much<br />  better that valmiki's, because valmiki gave things as is, where as<br />  Kambar polished it to make it more suitable for tamil literature.</p>
<p>  Though we can appreciate it, if we want to know ramayana as is, then<br />  valmiki is THE source IMHO.</p>
<p>  PS : <a href="http://www.tamilhindu" title="www.tamilhindu">www.tamilhindu</a>. com has a series on Kamba Ramayanam, by<br />  Mr.Harikrishnan, who is an authority in both Valmiki and Kamba<br />  ramayanam. Those interested can read Kamba ramayanam with urai both in<br />  english and tamil.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link Satish, I was looking for a good Kamba Ramayana link for long.<br />?<br />Yes it is true that Valmiki's epic was the original and all the rest evolved out of it. Robert Goldman one of the oldest western scholars of the epic also writes that *most* of the epic seems to have been written by a single author who is a man, there fore Valmiki.<br />?<br />Kambar made it more palatable yes. In the process Kambar also introduced morals and values of his generation which made the epic much more complex than the simple story it was and?more easy to critique by DK/DMK ites. I have the greatest respect for Kambar's poetry but to keep in mind both Kambar and Valmiki are not historians, they are poets, and we have to give margin to that. <br />?<br />It is a good idea to avoid taking the Ramayana or the Mahabharata literallyand getting overtly sentimental over whether or not it is fact. First of all those of us who are keen on history should not be very upset when it is not in line with our sentiments (including <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  itself). There are many partsof the RAmayana that are completely unpalatable - we talked about the horse sacrifice once before. Paula Richman, another modern day scholar, points out that Sita's fire ordeal and the Uttara Ramayana clearly appear to be interpolations (much to my delight, now I can keep my Rama and my feminist ideals intact!!). My western educated 13 year old nephew wants to know how and why the Mahabharat is any less violent than some of his video games. I like to stick with Gandhi, that it was an anology to wars of the mind. I dont' know anything better for him and happen to like the Mahabharat very much.<br />?<br />Malathi</acronym></p>

<p>Deepak,</p>
<p>You yourself said it is an interpretation. Interpretation are not<br />original and hence its duplicate. I am great fan of Kamba Ramayanam,<br />though I have not read it. Just a glimpse of it made me to start<br />loving tamil literature. So I have great regards for that.</p>
<p>But we should accept that, Kambar, took the main story line and<br />modified many a things, like characterization of many characters<br />(Actually I should say polish). Kambars character might look much<br />better that valmiki's, because valmiki gave things as is, where as<br />Kambar polished it to make it more suitable for tamil literature.</p>
<p>Though we can appreciate it, if we want to know ramayana as is, then<br />valmiki is THE source <acronym title="In my humble opinion" IMHO</acronym .</p>
<p><acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  : <a href="http://www.tamilhindu" title="www.tamilhindu">www.tamilhindu. com has a series on Kamba Ramayanam, by<br />Mr.Harikrishnan, who is an authority in both Valmiki and Kamba<br />ramayanam.

<p>Valkimi Ramayana and Vyasa bharatam - we call it as ithihas...<br />Kamba Ramayanam is classified as literature and not ithihasam. same<br />with other works ...</p>

<p>  I am a little confused here. When you say the Atma is Free, what do <br />  you mean to say? Is it free from the Karmic Bondage or is it free to <br />  act on its own.</p>
<p>  Apart from the above doubt, the other things what you have said are <br />  very valid. And I am no expert. Just that my teacher taught me to <br />  question the rationale behind every claim, keeping aside the <br />  hagiologies and other mystic references. The moment we keep these two <br />  aside, we start to analyise purely based on Logic only and this is <br />  what is true rationality or Pagutharivu.</p>

<p>Dear <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym ,</p>
<p>When I say atma is free, it is free from everything..let it be karmic<br />bondage or will to act on its own. As the upanishads say, two birds on<br />the tree, one eating the fruit and other seeing it (adam eve story is<br />said to be based on this), the bird watching the other bird eating<br />fruit is the atma and the bird that is eating the fruit is the 'I'.<br />Only with the ego, we feel that we are doing things but actually if we<br />remove the 'I', there is no action done by atma. Gita says the same.<br />Thats what we mean by saying, atma is no qualities. </p>
<p>Only because we dont think that we are free, we are bonded. Realizing<br />that we are free is self realization. It that state, the self cannot<br />do anything on its own. (people argue that if I am free I am licensed<br />to do whatever I like and so nothing is wrong, and does all the wrong.<br />This is explanantion for that arguement).</p>
<p>And whatever I say, its not my gnana, its Swami Vivekananda's.... :)</p>

<p>For the story line, Azhwars side with Valmiki's version more. But <br />when it comes to singing about the Tamizhar marabu, Azhwars and <br />Kamban takes the same side. In fact, even Kamban renounces the <br />concept of Free Will, just like Azhwars. I dont know the exact <br />verses. But I heard my teacher saying this. I am yet to get into <br />Kamba Ramayanam. So it may take some time to give quote from Kamban <br />verses.</p>

<p>      VV, There are research books written extensively on origins and <br />    interpolations in both Ramayana and Mahabharat. I? have not read <br />  any <br />    on Mahabharat but the Ramayana there is a very good book written <br />by <br />    Paula Richman, Many Ramayanas - where she talks of significant <br />gaps <br />    in the story that appear to be material dropped, and changes in <br />  style <br />    of writing that do not appear like the same author. She says a <br />big <br />    gap is no mention of Bharata or Ayodhya during 14 years of exile <br />  and <br />    why Sri Rama did not seek his brother's help instead of <br />travelling <br />    south to Lanka alone. We have to know sanskrit prety well to look <br />    into changes in writing but it appears like very possible that <br />the <br />    Ramayana after Sita's kidnapping may have been authored by <br />someone <br />    else.<br />      ?<br />      I agree with Satish's point that the Mahabharat appears very <br />  close <br />    knit to assume anything happened with the original. But 'vaai <br />vazhi <br />    kadhai' will have gaps all the time. Even two discourses on the <br />  same <br />    original are not the same. <br />      ?<br />      Learning scripture by heart is fine, I agree. I learnt lot of <br />    things like that,?all the suprabhats, sahasranaas and various <br />    slokas. ?Mahabharat is not a scripture to be learnt that way and <br />  from <br />    what I know it is even forbidden to read it at home.<br />      ?<br />      Malathi<br />      --- On Sat, 8/23/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh <vinjamoor_venkatesh@  <br />    wrote:</vinjamoor_venkatesh@></p>

<p>      Sathish,</p>
<p>      Very rational analysis. In fact I have heard it (Kanchi <br />  Periyava's <br />      stance) too. That is true. The very reason the Vedas were <br />called <br />      Sruthi is just because of the fact that they were only Heard <br />for <br />  by-<br />      hearting.</p>
<p>      I realised this myself. The teacher who teaches me the Azhwars' <br />      Prabhandams, allowed me to keep the book open for the first 5 <br />  days, <br />      just to get a grasp of the words clearly, from the 6th day <br />  onwards, <br />      he ordered me to close the book. The reason he gave was that if <br />  we <br />      keep the book open, we will not be able to memorise it fast and <br />    even <br />      if we do so we will forget it soon. </p>
<p>      Believe me, I just remember whatever he taught me, with the <br />books <br />      closed for the next 10-12 days. </p>
<p>      One more perspective to add to what you said. In those days, <br />      personally I would say that, they were more conservative and <br />  there <br />      would have been strong opposition and criticism for any new <br />  ideas. <br />      Even today we see that most of the elders object to everything <br />  new <br />      that is tried to infuse in some of the traditional practices. <br />In <br />      those days it would have been more.</p>
<p>      I dont know about others, but atleast in Srivaishnavism it is <br />  very <br />      much. In fact I am pretty sure that most of the Iyengars who <br />are <br />      supposed to be very traditional, would really term me an <br />outcaste <br />      when I said "ariyum Sivanum OnRu", though that is the fact <br />      considering the "true" nature of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>      Why I am saying all these is because, when there can be so much <br />      resistance even in these times, think of the resistance that <br />  would <br />      have been there 3000 years back or even more. So I am sure, <br />like <br />    you, <br />      that there could not have been much of creepings happening. But <br />  at <br />      the same time definitely a lot of "idaicherugals" have happened <br />  in <br />      the last millennium or so. Take for example the statement made <br />by <br />    the <br />      Central Government in the Ramasethu case regarding Rama <br />breaking <br />    the <br />      bridge while returning back from SriLanka. They even quoted <br />      supporting verses from Kamba Ramayanam, taking cue from <br />  the "urai" <br />      pubished by VM Gopalakrishnamachar iar. I have that book myself <br />  and <br />      yes, as quoted by the Government, the verses that confirm this <br />      statement are indeed present in that. But remember that many <br />  Tamizh <br />      scholars have rejected a lot of verses in Kamba Ramayanam as <br />      idaicherugals, not after the start of the Ramasethu controversy <br />  but <br />      atleast 3 or 4 decades back, when there was apparently no <br />    controversy <br />      and the project was itself in the godown.</p>
<p>      So I would say that, with time, when the sincerity &amp; honesty of <br />  the <br />      Human race took the beating, the idaichergals started and <br />looking <br />      back at the history, this is more to have happened only in the <br />  last <br />      millennium or even starting just 5 centuries back. Surely <br />during <br />    the <br />      times between VyAsa and Vaisampayana, just for 3 generations, I <br />      presume it could not have happened. </p>
<p>      But all that we say (either Your statement or Malathi's <br />  statement) <br />      are only "possibilities" and we can't conclude until we have <br />  ample <br />      proofs.</p>

<p><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym , There are research books written extensively on origins and interpolations in both Ramayana and Mahabharat.

She says a big gap is no mention of Bharata or Ayodhya during 14 years of exile and why Sri Rama did not seek his brother's help instead of travelling south to Lanka alone.

<p>Sathish,</p>
<p>Very rational analysis. In fact I have heard it (Kanchi Periyava's <br />stance) too. That is true. The very reason the Vedas were called <br />Sruthi is just because of the fact that they were only Heard for by-<br />hearting.</p>
<p>I realised this myself. The teacher who teaches me the Azhwars' <br />Prabhandams, allowed me to keep the book open for the first 5 days, <br />just to get a grasp of the words clearly, from the 6th day onwards, <br />he ordered me to close the book. The reason he gave was that if we <br />keep the book open, we will not be able to memorise it fast and even <br />if we do so we will forget it soon. </p>
<p>Believe me, I just remember whatever he taught me, with the books <br />closed for the next 10-12 days. </p>
<p>One more perspective to add to what you said. In those days, <br />personally I would say that, they were more conservative and there <br />would have been strong opposition and criticism for any new ideas. <br />Even today we see that most of the elders object to everything new <br />that is tried to infuse in some of the traditional practices. In <br />those days it would have been more.</p>
<p>I dont know about others, but atleast in Srivaishnavism it is very <br />much. In fact I am pretty sure that most of the Iyengars who are <br />supposed to be very traditional, would really term me an outcaste <br />when I said "ariyum Sivanum OnRu", though that is the fact <br />considering the "true" nature of the Supreme Being.</p>

So I am sure, like you, <br />that there could not have been much of creepings happening.

In fact I am pretty sure that most of the Iyengars who are <br />supposed to be very traditional, would really term me an outcaste <br />when I said "ariyum Sivanum OnRu", though that is the fact <br />considering the "true" nature of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>Why I am saying all these is because, when there can be so much <br />resistance even in these times, think of the resistance that would <br />have been there 3000 years back or even more. So I am sure, like you, <br />that there could not have been much of creepings happening. But at <br />the same time definitely a lot of "idaicherugals" have happened in <br />the last millennium or so. Take for example the statement made by the <br />Central Government<br />in the Ramasethu case regarding Rama breaking the <br />bridge while returning back from SriLanka. They even quoted <br />supporting verses from Kamba Ramayanam, taking cue from the "urai" <br />pubished by VM Gopalakrishnamachar iar. I have that book myself and <br />yes, as quoted by the Government, the verses that confirm this <br />statement are indeed present in that. But remember that many Tamizh <br />scholars have rejected a lot of verses in Kamba Ramayanam as <br />idaicherugals, not after the start of the Ramasethu controversy but <br />atleast 3 or 4 decades back, when there was apparently no controversy <br />and the project was itself in the godown.</p>
<p>So I would say that, with time, when the sincerity &amp; honesty of the <br />Human race took the beating, the idaichergals started and looking <br />back at the history, this is more to have happened only in the last <br />millennium or even starting just 5 centuries back. Surely during the <br />times between<br />VyAsa and Vaisampayana, just for 3 generations, I <br />presume it could not have happened. </p>
<p>But all that we say (either Your statement or Malathi's statement) <br />are only "possibilities" and we can't conclude until we have ample <br />proofs.</p>

<p>    Also to remember the Mahabharat as written by Vyasa was related by<br />  his grandson Vaishampayana to Arjuna's grandson Janamejaya in the<br />  great 'sarpa yagna'. As I understand whatever we have now is the<br />  record of Vaishampayana' s narration, not Vyasa's original. There <br />fore<br />  3 degrees of narration within the same epic it is wholly possible<br />  things were left out, added and so on.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Ravi, I agree with you that all versions are same conceptually. The storyline which is a manifestation of the concept is not that way, yes it is a vision but how do we know the vision was passed down or even interpreted correctly by followers? There are Ramayanas world over by the way, not just in India. Some of them are very offensive to indian sentimens such as Rama and Sita being siblings, or Sita Ravana&#39;s daughter and so on. People in those countries beieve them as dearly as we do. There is nothing absolute about any vision or version only our belif that is all.</p>

<p>     Sathish, </p>
<p>     Very rational analysis. In fact I have heard it (Kanchi <br />  Periyava's <br />     stance) too. That is true. The very reason the Vedas were called <br />     Sruthi is just because of the fact that they were only Heard for <br />  by- <br />     hearting. </p>
<p>     I realised this myself. The teacher who teaches me the Azhwars' <br />     Prabhandams, allowed me to keep the book open for the first 5 <br />  days, <br />     just to get a grasp of the words clearly, from the 6th day <br />  onwards, <br />     he ordered me to close the book. The reason he gave was that if <br />  we <br />     keep the book open, we will not be able to memorise it fast and <br />   even <br />     if we do so we will forget it soon. </p>
<p>     Believe me, I just remember whatever he taught me, with the books <br />     closed for the next 10-12 days. </p>
<p>     One more perspective to add to what you said. In those days, <br />     personally I would say that, they were more conservative and <br />  there <br />     would have been strong opposition and criticism for any new <br />  ideas. <br />     Even today we see that most of the elders object to everything <br />  new <br />     that is tried to infuse in some of the traditional practices. In <br />     those days it would have been more. </p>
<p>     I dont know about others, but atleast in Srivaishnavism it is <br />  very <br />     much. In fact I am pretty sure that most of the Iyengars who are <br />     supposed to be very traditional, would really term me an outcaste <br />     when I said "ariyum Sivanum OnRu", though that is the fact <br />     considering the "true" nature of the Supreme Being. </p>
<p>     Why I am saying all these is because, when there can be so much <br />     resistance even in these times, think of the resistance that <br />  would <br />     have been there 3000 years back or even more. So I am sure, like <br />   you, <br />     that there could not have been much of creepings happening. But <br />  at <br />     the same time definitely a lot of "idaicherugals" have happened <br />  in <br />     the last millennium or so.

<p>    I realised this myself. The teacher who teaches me the Azhwars' <br />    Prabhandams, allowed me to keep the book open for the first 5 <br />days, <br />    just to get a grasp of the words clearly, from the 6th day <br />onwards, <br />    he ordered me to close the book. The reason he gave was that if <br />we <br />    keep the book open, we will not be able to memorise it fast and <br />  even <br />    if we do so we will forget it soon. </p>
<p>    Believe me, I just remember whatever he taught me, with the books <br />    closed for the next 10-12 days. </p>
<p>    One more perspective to add to what you said. In those days, <br />    personally I would say that, they were more conservative and <br />there <br />    would have been strong opposition and criticism for any new <br />ideas. <br />    Even today we see that most of the elders object to everything <br />new <br />    that is tried to infuse in some of the traditional practices. In <br />    those days it would have been more.</p>
<p>    I dont know about others, but atleast in Srivaishnavism it is <br />very <br />    much. In fact I am pretty sure that most of the Iyengars who are <br />    supposed to be very traditional, would really term me an outcaste <br />    when I said "ariyum Sivanum OnRu", though that is the fact <br />    considering the "true" nature of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>    Why I am saying all these is because, when there can be so much <br />    resistance even in these times, think of the resistance that <br />would <br />    have been there 3000 years back or even more. So I am sure, like <br />  you, <br />    that there could not have been much of creepings happening. But <br />at <br />    the same time definitely a lot of "idaicherugals" have happened <br />in <br />    the last millennium or so. Take for example the statement made by <br />  the <br />    Central Government in the Ramasethu case regarding Rama breaking <br />  the <br />    bridge while returning back from SriLanka. They even quoted <br />    supporting verses from Kamba Ramayanam, taking cue from <br />the "urai" <br />    pubished by VM Gopalakrishnamachar iar. I have that book myself <br />and <br />    yes, as quoted by the Government, the verses that confirm this <br />    statement are indeed present in that. But remember that many <br />Tamizh <br />    scholars have rejected a lot of verses in Kamba Ramayanam as <br />    idaicherugals, not after the start of the Ramasethu controversy <br />but <br />    atleast 3 or 4 decades back, when there was apparently no <br />  controversy <br />    and the project was itself in the godown.</p>
<p>    So I would say that, with time, when the sincerity &amp; honesty of <br />the <br />    Human race took the beating, the idaichergals started and looking <br />    back at the history, this is more to have happened only in the <br />last <br />    millennium or even starting just 5 centuries back. Surely during <br />  the <br />    times between VyAsa and Vaisampayana, just for 3 generations, I <br />    presume it could not have happened. </p>
<p>    But all that we say (either Your statement or Malathi's <br />statement) <br />    are only "possibilities" and we can't conclude until we have <br />ample <br />    proofs.</p>

<p>on Mahabharat but the Ramayana there is a very good book written by <br />Paula Richman, Many Ramayanas - where she talks of significant gaps <br />in the story that appear to be material dropped, and changes in style <br />of writing that do not appear like the same author. She says a big <br />gap is no mention of Bharata or Ayodhya during 14 years of exile and <br />why Sri Rama did not seek his brother's help instead of travelling <br />south to Lanka alone. We have to know sanskrit prety well to look <br />into changes in writing but it appears like very possible that the <br />Ramayana after Sita's kidnapping may have been authored by someone <br />else.</p>
<blockquote><p>  ?<br />  I agree with Satish's point that the Mahabharat appears very close <br />knit to assume anything happened with the original. But 'vaai vazhi </p></blockquote>
<p>kadhai' will have gaps all the time. Even two discourses on the same <br />original are not the same. </p>

<p>    I am no expert like VV, Ravi et al.</p>
<p>    Just trying to put forth what I understand.</p>
<p>    The first step of bondage of the self is to think that we are not<br />    free. The atman is free and till we recognize it we are caught in <br />  the<br />    samsara sagaram. This is because we attribute every action to 'I',<br />    thinking that I am doing this, I am doing that. This 'I' is the <br />  cause<br />    of Karma. Once we relinquish this 'I' and do our duty, then we <br />are <br />  not<br />    bound by karma. Very difficult to realize and attain this and <br />trying<br />    to do things without expecting results is the first step of <br />  karmayoga.</p>
<p>    Easiest way is bakthi yoga, where we surrender to the God saying<br />    everything is yours, whatever I do is because of you. When we <br />come <br />  to<br />    this state,as VV referred as 'willing slaves', then we dont take<br />    responsibility of our actions, and slowly the 'I' in us will be<br />    dissolved and we can be free. Till then, yes, there is no free <br />will<br />    but the struggle of life is only to be free.</p>
<p>    There is nothing called wrong or right in this world. There is <br />only<br />    'sathya', and if we say someone is doing a mistake, it means that <br />  they<br />    are moving from a lower truth to higher truth to attain the <br />ultimate<br />    truth. So whatever we feel/do, let it be free will or slavery, <br />  nothing<br />    is wrong as long as we try to move forward towards the ultimate <br />  sathya.</p>

<p>        But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism <br />  Philosophy <br />        perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-<br />  belief on <br />        Him, is done by Him only. <br />      ................<br />        Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect <br />to <br />  be so <br />        merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him <br />  as the <br />        Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then <br />there <br />  would <br />        be no doubt in anyone's mind about what He can do, <br />considering <br />  the <br />        Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.</p>
<p>      Does this mean that we don't have any 'free will' at all?<br />      If that is the case, how do we accumulate our Karma in the <br />first <br />  place?</p>
<p>      I thought that when we say 'All Thy Will' as all the <br />      Thevaaram/Thiruvaasagam/Paasurams are saying, it is an attitude <br />of<br />    mind to <br />      have, in order to surrender to Him and annhililate our Ego.</p>
<p>      I would be grateful for an explanation from your point of view.<br />      Thank you.</p>

        <p><acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VV</acronym , There are research books written extensively on origins and interpolations in both Ramayana and Mahabharat. I? have not read any on Mahabharat but the Ramayana there is a very good book written by Paula Richman, Many Ramayanas - where she talks of significant gaps in the story that appear to be material dropped, and changes in style of writing that do not appear likethe same author. She says a big gap is no mention of Bharata or Ayodhya during 14 years of exile and why Sri Rama did not seek his brother's help instead of travelling south to Lanka alone. We have to know sanskrit prety well to look into changes in writing but it appears like very possible that the Ramayana after Sita's kidnapping may have been authored by someone else.<br />?<br />I agree with Satish's point that the Mahabharat appears very close knit to assume anything happened with the original. But 'vaai vazhi kadhai' will have gaps all the time. Even two discourses on the same original are not the same. <br />?<br />Learning scripture by heart is fine, I agree. I learnt lot of things like that,?all the suprabhats, sahasranaas and various slokas. ?Mahabharat isnot a scripture to be learnt that way and from what I know it is even forbidden to read it at home.<br />?<br />Malathi<br />--- On Sat, 8/23/08, vinjamoor_venkatesh <vinjamoor_venkatesh@yahoo.com  wrote:</p>

<p>Sathish,</p>
<p>Very rational analysis. In fact I have heard it (Kanchi Periyava's <br />stance) too. That is true. The very reason the Vedas were called <br />Sruthi is just because of the fact that they were only Heard for by-<br />hearting.</p>
<p>I realised this myself. The teacher who teaches me the Azhwars' <br />Prabhandams, allowed me to keep the book open for the first 5 days, <br />just to get a grasp of the words clearly, from the 6th day onwards, <br />he ordered me to close the book. The reason he gave was that if we <br />keep the book open, we will not be able to memorise it fast and even <br />if we do so we will forget it soon. </p>
<p>Believe me, I just remember whatever he taught me, with the books <br />closed for the next 10-12 days. </p>
<p>One more perspective to add to what you said. In those days, <br />personally I would say that, they were more conservative and there <br />would have been strong opposition and criticism for any new ideas. <br />Even today we see that most of the elders object to everything new <br />that is tried to infuse in some of the traditional practices. In <br />those days it would have been more.</p>
<p>I dont know about others, but atleast in Srivaishnavism it is very <br />much. In fact I am pretty sure that most of the Iyengars who are <br />supposed to be very traditional, would really term me an outcaste <br />when I said "ariyum Sivanum OnRu", though that is the fact <br />considering the "true" nature of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>Why I am saying all these is because, when there can be so much <br />resistance even in these times, think of the resistance that would <br />have been there 3000 years back or even more. So I am sure, like you, <br />that there could not have been much of creepings happening. But at <br />the same time definitely a lot of "idaicherugals" have happened in <br />the last millennium or so. Take for example the statement made by the <br />Central Government in the Ramasethu case regarding Rama breaking the <br />bridge while returning back from SriLanka. They even quoted <br />supporting verses from Kamba Ramayanam, taking cue from the "urai" <br />pubished by VM Gopalakrishnamachar iar. I have that book myself and <br />yes, as quoted by the Government, the verses that confirm this <br />statement are indeed present in that. But remember that many Tamizh <br />scholars have rejected a lot of verses in Kamba Ramayanam as <br />idaicherugals, not after the start of the Ramasethu controversy but <br />atleast 3 or 4 decades back, when there was apparently no controversy <br />and the project was itself in the godown.</p>
<p>So I would say that, with time, when the sincerity &amp; honesty of the <br />Human race took the beating, the idaichergals started and looking <br />back at the history, this is more to have happened only in the last <br />millennium or even starting just 5 centuries back. Surely during the <br />times between VyAsa and Vaisampayana, just for 3 generations, I <br />presume it could not have happened. </p>
<p>But all that we say (either Your statement or Malathi's statement) <br />are only "possibilities" and we can't conclude until we have ample <br />proofs.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Thats where we differ from our ancestors. Till the British came to<br />  India and started documenting everything, the mode of education in<br />  India was by sishya parampara.

Even<br />  today we say thalai keezh paadam...thookathul a ezhupi ketalum <br />theriyanum.</p>
<p>  That was the quality of education we had and if that was the case,<br />  just 100 years back, we are talking about nearly 5000 years where <br />the<br />  human mind would have been more clear to remember things. So 3 <br />degrees<br />  of narration and errors...I dont think that crept in....then we <br />would<br />  have lost almost all the veda's and upanishads by now. </p>
<p>  Kanchi mahaperiyaval says that,we started forgeting things only <br />after<br />  documenting them. If there is no documents, we will strive to<br />  remember, if we have a book, we will lazy thinking, ok i have the<br />  book, I can refer to it anytime, but we will never refer. Thats why<br />  the people who knew sanskrit and veda's have come down drastically <br />in<br />  just a century, whereas our forefathers have preserved for eons <br />together.</p>

<p>    Also to remember the Mahabharat as written by Vyasa was related by<br />  his grandson Vaishampayana to Arjuna's grandson Janamejaya in the<br />  great 'sarpa yagna'. As I understand whatever we have now is the<br />  record of Vaishampayana' s narration, not Vyasa's original. There <br />fore<br />  3 degrees of narration within the same epic it is wholly possible<br />  things were left out, added and so on.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have, there are various translations, rajaji's version is a simple <br />option to break down the complex food into a common man.<br />Mahabharata can however cater itself to the mind level of the reader.</p>

<blockquote><p>  People,</p>
<p>  How many in our group have read Vyasar Virundhu (Rajaji's <br />Mahabharatha) He<br />  covers everything in the Mahabharatha and the beauty is that it is <br />crisp /<br />  small as a capsule. All the discussions that are happening now - <br />Janemejaya<br />  / Vaishampayana all these feature in the first chapter of Rajaji's<br />  Mahabharata. This book you can finish it in a weekend session. This <br />is<br />  regarding my favorite Mahabharatha Book.</p>
<p>  Coming to Udankar's appearance in Mahabharata (Not me, but the <br />Maharishi.<br />  But I am using the same spelling which I use in my official <br />records) Guess<br />  its time for me to re-read the Mahabharat again. I remember the <br />incident<br />  when Mahavishnu meets Udankar Maharishi in the Kurushetra region,<br />  post Kurushetra war and why the rain clouds in the deserts are <br />called<br />  "Udanga Mehangal" But this "Pidi Sabham" to Krishna I can't <br />recollect. My<br />  gut feel is that, it may not be Udankar Maharishi as he happens to <br />be a<br />  staunch devotee of Mahavishnu and how can he curse an Avatar of <br />Mahavishnu!</p>
<p>  Opening up one more more pandora box ... If you go by the ISKCON <br />idea Its<br />  Krsna who is supreme not Vishnu. Vishnu is considered as an <br />incarnation of<br />  Krsna, not the other way round as we read. People who are from <br />ISKCON can<br />  throw more light on this.</p>

<p>Simple - straight forward analysis. </p>
<p>The I does not go unless we understand the core of what we are. Only <br />when we realize that we do not control anything, right from the air <br />we breathe to the action that happens, we must resign ourselves to <br />the fact that the I has never been there in the first place and we <br />are holding on to something that is never been there, hence we have <br />been cast out from our real space with the eternity. </p>
<p>This 'I' here is totally not related or combined with the sentence 'I <br />am ravi or I am satish' - that I is physical, very much there. </p>
<p>The I here is above the physical concept, it is attached to the mind <br />and action or thought....</p>

<blockquote><p>  I am no expert like VV, Ravi et al.</p>
<p>  Just trying to put forth what I understand.</p>
<p>  The first step of bondage of the self is to think that we are not<br />  free. The atman is free and till we recognize it we are caught in <br />the<br />  samsara sagaram. This is because we attribute every action to 'I',<br />  thinking that I am doing this, I am doing that. This 'I' is the <br />cause<br />  of Karma. Once we relinquish this 'I' and do our duty, then we are <br />not<br />  bound by karma. Very difficult to realize and attain this and trying<br />  to do things without expecting results is the first step of <br />karmayoga.</p>
<p>  Easiest way is bakthi yoga, where we surrender to the God saying<br />  everything is yours, whatever I do is because of you. When we come <br />to<br />  this state,as VV referred as 'willing slaves', then we dont take<br />  responsibility of our actions, and slowly the 'I' in us will be<br />  dissolved and we can be free. Till then, yes, there is no free will<br />  but the struggle of life is only to be free.</p>
<p>  There is nothing called wrong or right in this world. There is only<br />  'sathya', and if we say someone is doing a mistake, it means that <br />they<br />  are moving from a lower truth to higher truth to attain the ultimate<br />  truth. So whatever we feel/do, let it be free will or slavery, <br />nothing<br />  is wrong as long as we try to move forward towards the ultimate <br />sathya.</p>

But when one looks upon Him <br />as the <br />      Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there <br />would <br />      be no doubt in anyone's mind about what He can do, considering <br />the <br />      Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.</p>
<p>    Does this mean that we don't have any 'free will' at all?<br />    If that is the case, how do we accumulate our Karma in the first <br />place?</p>
<p>    I thought that when we say 'All Thy Will' as all the <br />    Thevaaram/Thiruvaasagam/Paasurams are saying, it is an attitude of<br />  mind to <br />    have, in order to surrender to Him and annhililate our Ego.</p>
<p>    I would be grateful for an explanation from your point of view.<br />    Thank you.</p>

          Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I am no philoshpical expert but a practical two cents -<br />Free will is not an illusion. It is limited than what we think that is all.Just having choices does not mean person can make them. It depends on yourbackground, psychological mindset, and several factors to be able to make a choice. <br />?<br />I don't remember who said it but someone I read - It is more dangerous to believe you dont' have a choice than it is to actually not have a choice. Inother words human confidence is based on the assumption that we have a free will or choice. If we negate that completely eeryone will be wimpy slavesof some power most people dont' really know. Only very few people are confident slaves, sages and saints of great spiritual maturity.</p>

<p>I am giving below the first para of an article from TOI, 19 aug. I could not find the link from toi website; I will post it when it is made available.</p>
<p>What The Gita Says About Free Will And Destiny<br />'Paramarthi Raina'</p>
<p>We take for granted that we have the free will to make conscious decisions to choose between different possible courses of action. However, recently conducted experiments in the Max Planck Institute in Germany on the functioning of the human brain, have put that presumption into doubt. The researchers have concluded that free will could, in fact, be "little more than an illusion".</p>
<p>The experiments indicated that our subconscious mind decides on and dictates our actions, long before our conscious mind actually realises it.</p>
<p>Food for thought!!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Atpu,</p>
<p>  Just my two cents worth.</p>
<p>  But before that a Caveat: As said earlier, this is based on <br />  philosophies of one particular sect. Does not necessarily mean that <br />  this is the only correct view. It still could be, from a human point <br />  of view but from the all-mercy Almighty's point of view, there can be <br />  absolutely nothing wrong. For Him, everything is just correct. I will <br />  explain the supporting verses for this caveat later.</p>

<p>    Does this mean that we don't have any 'free will' at all?<br />    If that is the case, how do we accumulate our Karma in the first <br />  place?</p>
<p>    I thought that when we say 'All Thy Will' as all the <br />    Thevaaram/Thiruvaas agam/Paasurams are saying, it is an attitude of <br />  mind to <br />    have, in order to surrender to Him and annhililate our Ego.</p>
<p>  Yes, according to this philosophy, there is absolutely no free will <br />  on part of the Athma. This, is a point of debate between various <br />  sects of Hinduism and even within Srivaishnavism itself. Some say <br />  that the Atma is indeed given a free will first, and based on its <br />  initial action, the good or bad karma starts accumulating for the <br />  Atma. This case is presented, so that one shall not say that the God <br />  is biased when He supposedly blesses some while troubling (I wouldn't <br />  call it a punishment) others for no mistake of the Atma.</p>
<p>  And some others say that the Athma is absolutely independant and <br />  hence the karma accrues to it according to its deed.</p>
<p>  A Logical Rational Analysis:- </p>
<p>  The people who ascribe a "Free Will" to Atma just to ensure that no <br />  one says anything wrong on the part of the God, forget the fact that <br />  when there is absolutely no one equal to or greater than Him, no <br />  blame accumulate on His part. When He is THE Supreme Being and the <br />  owner of everything, just about everything, then can't He act the way <br />  He wishes? Why should He be bound by what the mere humans, created by <br />  Him thinks? </p>
<p>  On the other hand, the supporters of "No Free Will" just resign to <br />  the fact that He is the Sarva Swami (Swami-means the absolute owner <br />  of everything) and that we are all willing slaves. No matter whatever <br />  we think about Him, He is what He is. Just think about this. No <br />  matter what a person thinks about it, a Mountain is indeed a <br />  Mountain. Just take case of Brahmaputra river. While we in India call <br />  it as Brahmaputra, the Chinese at it origin call it Yang Tse. Does it <br />  changes the character of the river? Similarly, the God remains unique <br />  in all aspects and He just acts the way He wishes, no matter what His <br />  creatures think of Him. Thinking that He is biased is the limitation <br />  of the Jeevatma. He is definitely not bound by what the Jeeva thinks. <br />  The moment one says that He is bounded by what the Jeevatma thinks of <br />  Him, then immediately the Supremity of the God is put to question as <br />  how can a person, who can be questioned for His acts, be called a <br />  Supreme Being or Brahman.</p>
<p>  And I would never think that the Azhwars and Nayanmars were doing Lip <br />  Service when they said that "It is Him who acts and not them the <br />  mortals". They had absolute faith on this aspect of God and that is <br />  what is the essence of their wonderful pourings.</p>
<p>  Finally as I said in the caveat above, let me give you the supporting <br />  verses which confirm that there is no "one correct" method to reach <br />  the God. </p>
<p>  Nammazhwar says in Thiruviruttham,</p>
<p>  vaNangum thuRigaL pala pala Akki, madhi vikaRppAl<br />  piNangum samayam pala pala Akki, avai avai thORu<br />  aNangum pala pala Akki, nin mUrthy parappi vaithhAi<br />  iNangu innOrai illai, nin kaN vEtkai yezhuvippanE.</p>
<p>  The essence of the above pAsuram is that:- He has created so many <br />  religions and hence so many ways for the Jeevatma to attain Him and <br />  then He is present as the Supreme God in every Religion of the world <br />  and such God is created a non-ending thirst on part of the Azhwar to <br />  reach His lotus feet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>  This is the proof that every religion, sect, subsect et all are just <br />  different routes to attain God. </p>
<p>  And finally, God Himself ensures that all His creations reach Him <br />  back when He wishes. Nammazhwar, again, this time in Thiruvaimozhi, <br />  says, "avar avar vidhi vazhi adaya ninRanarE" in the first decad and <br />  in the penultimate decad says " vaikuntham puguvadhu maNNavar <br />  vidihyE". This two gives a better understanding of what is Destiny <br />  or "vidhi". That, everyone born in this world are destined to reach <br />  Him and that Destiny is He Himself and His wishes.</p>
<p>  The fact that everyone reaches Him finally is also corroborated by <br />  Thirumangai Azhwar. I have quoted this just two days back</p>
<p>  "manjADu varai yEzhum, vAnagamum maNNagamum, maRRum ellAm<br />  enjAmal vayiRRadakki Alin mEl Or iLam thaLiril kaN vaLarndha eesan"</p>
<p>  So, forgetting the fact that one sect is ascribing to this <br />  philosophy, when one does a logical analysis, then I am sure they <br />  will come to this conclusion.</p>
<p>  In fact this is exactly why I wanted our members to come out with an <br />  answer of what they perceive their Ideal God to possess as. </p>
<p>  I dont know if I was able to satisfy your query. Please let me know <br />  if you need more clarifications on this perspective.</p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh</p>
<p>    I would be grateful for an explanation from your point of view.<br />    Thank you.</p>

<p>      Smt Malathi,</p>
<p>      You said:<br />      ============ ======Quote= ========= ========= =====<br />      That is a great philosphy as long as I am not subject to one of <br />      those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe lose a child or <br />      anything else. If that happens it can and it will turn to great <br />      hatred against Him.Now am not implying everyone who has cruel <br />  things <br />      happen cannot believe in a personal God many people do but these <br />  are <br />      just some challenges with that approach.<br />      ============ ======Unquote= ========= ========= ====</p>
<p>      You are very correct in this observation. We do see many people <br />      saying "kadavulE unakku karuNayE illayA...." etc, when they <br />      encounter such tragedies in their life. And like you said, there <br />  are <br />      indeed some who even stop believing in His existence. </p>
<p>      But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism <br />  Philosophy <br />      perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief <br />  on <br />      Him, is done by Him only. </p>
<p>      Thirumazhisai Azhwar, in his Thiruchandhavirutth am says,</p>
<p>      naccharAvaNaik kidantha nAtha! nin pAdha pOdhinil vaitha sindhai, <br />      vAnguvitthu nInguivikka, nee inam meithan vallai AdhalAl, <br />  aRindhanan <br />      nin mAyamE, mayakkal ennai mAyanE</p>
<p>      Meaning, Oh my Lord who lies on the Snake Bed! You are capable of <br />      giving the thoughts about You to your creation, and also capable <br />  of <br />      taking it back. So please do not do that(taking away your <br />  thoughts) <br />      to me. I know you!!! </p>
<p>      Again, this signifies the fact that He controls everything and <br />      anything in the world and this has to be Natural to Him as He is <br />  the <br />      sole proprietor of the creation and also the master.</p>
<p>      The above pAsuram just re-iterates the present day movie songs <br />  that <br />      I quoted earlier. "nAyakan mElirundhu.. ." and "kaNNanE <br />      kAttinAn...kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".</p>
<p>      Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be <br />  so <br />      merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as <br />  the <br />      Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there <br />  would <br />      be no doubt in anyone's mind about what He can do, considering <br />  the <br />      Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.</p>
<p>      This is the essence of Hinduism devoid of all the differences <br />      between the Godheads etc. And this Supreme Being according to <br />      Vaishnvaites is Vishnu and Saivites is Siva. Just being called by <br />      different names. What I mean to say is, keeping aside the <br />      visualisation of the Form (I mean, having Sangu-Chakram means <br />  Vishnu <br />      and Maan-Mazhu means Siva) when one tries to fit the God in the <br />      above role of having Absolute Supremacy over everything, then <br />  Siva <br />      and Vishnu are none but the same Supreme Being. </p>
<p>      This is what is glorified by Peyazhwar too,</p>
<p>      thAzh sadaiyum (Siva) nIL mudiyum (Vishnu) oN mazhuvum (Siva) <br />      chakkaramum (Vishnu) sUzh aravum (Siva) pon nANum (Vishnu) <br />  thOndRum <br />      mAL. Here "mAl" refers to being Supreme. The Azhwars saw <br />  everything <br />      as "mAl". Just that they visualised Him that way. </p>
<p>      Which is why the saying "Ariyum Sivanum Ondru"</p>

        <p>I have, there are various translations, rajaji's version is a simple <br />option to break down the complex food into a common man.<br />Mahabharata can however cater itself to the mind level of the reader.</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, Udanx <udanks@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  People,</p>
<p>  How many in our group have read Vyasar Virundhu (Rajaji's <br />Mahabharatha) He<br />  covers everything in the Mahabharatha and the beauty is that it is <br />crisp /<br />  small as a capsule. All the discussions that are happening now - <br />Janemejaya<br />  / Vaishampayana all these feature in the first chapter of Rajaji's<br />  Mahabharata. This book you can finish it in a weekend session. This <br />is<br />  regarding my favorite Mahabharatha Book.</p>
<p>  Coming to Udankar's appearance in Mahabharata (Not me, but the <br />Maharishi.<br />  But I am using the same spelling which I use in my official <br />records) Guess<br />  its time for me to re-read the Mahabharat again. I remember the <br />incident<br />  when Mahavishnu meets Udankar Maharishi in the Kurushetra region,<br />  post Kurushetra war and why the rain clouds in the deserts are <br />called<br />  "Udanga Mehangal" But this "Pidi Sabham" to Krishna I can't <br />recollect. My<br />  gut feel is that, it may not be Udankar Maharishi as he happens to <br />be a<br />  staunch devotee of Mahavishnu and how can he curse an Avatar of <br />Mahavishnu!</p>
<p>  Opening up one more more pandora box ... If you go by the ISKCON <br />idea Its<br />  Krsna who is supreme not Vishnu. Vishnu is considered as an <br />incarnation of<br />  Krsna, not the other way round as we read. People who are from <br />ISKCON can<br />  throw more light on this.</p>

          Hinduism - Good Karma and Bad Karma        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I am giving below the first para of an article from TOI, 19 aug. I could<br />not find the link from toi website; I will post it when it is made<br />available.</p>
<p>What The Gita Says About Free Will And Destiny<br />'Paramarthi Raina'</p>
<p>We take for granted that we have the free will to make conscious<br />decisions to choose between different possible courses of action.<br />However, recently conducted experiments in the Max Planck Institute in<br />Germany on the functioning of the human brain, have put that presumption<br />into doubt. The researchers have concluded that free will could, in<br />fact, be "little more than an illusion".</p>
<p>The experiments indicated that our subconscious mind decides on and<br />dictates our actions, long before our conscious mind actually realises<br />it.</p>
<p>Food for thought!!</p>

<p>  Just my two cents worth.</p>
<p>  But before that a Caveat: As said earlier, this is based on<br />  philosophies of one particular sect. Does not necessarily mean that<br />  this is the only correct view. It still could be, from a human point<br />  of view but from the all-mercy Almighty's point of view, there can be<br />  absolutely nothing wrong. For Him, everything is just correct. I will<br />  explain the supporting verses for this caveat later.</p>

<p>    Does this mean that we don't have any 'free will' at all?<br />    If that is the case, how do we accumulate our Karma in the first<br />  place?</p>
<p>    I thought that when we say 'All Thy Will' as all the<br />    Thevaaram/Thiruvaasagam/Paasurams are saying, it is an attitude of<br />  mind to<br />    have, in order to surrender to Him and annhililate our Ego.</p>
<p>  Yes, according to this philosophy, there is absolutely no free will<br />  on part of the Athma. This, is a point of debate between various<br />  sects of Hinduism and even within Srivaishnavism itself. Some say<br />  that the Atma is indeed given a free will first, and based on its<br />  initial action, the good or bad karma starts accumulating for the<br />  Atma. This case is presented, so that one shall not say that the God<br />  is biased when He supposedly blesses some while troubling (I wouldn't<br />  call it a punishment) others for no mistake of the Atma.</p>
<p>  And some others say that the Athma is absolutely independant and<br />  hence the karma accrues to it according to its deed.</p>
<p>  A Logical Rational Analysis:-</p>
<p>  The people who ascribe a "Free Will" to Atma just to ensure that no<br />  one says anything wrong on the part of the God, forget the fact that<br />  when there is absolutely no one equal to or greater than Him, no<br />  blame accumulate on His part. When He is THE Supreme Being and the<br />  owner of everything, just about everything, then can't He act the way<br />  He wishes? Why should He be bound by what the mere humans, created by<br />  Him thinks?</p>
<p>  On the other hand, the supporters of "No Free Will" just resign to<br />  the fact that He is the Sarva Swami (Swami-means the absolute owner<br />  of everything) and that we are all willing slaves. No matter whatever<br />  we think about Him, He is what He is. Just think about this. No<br />  matter what a person thinks about it, a Mountain is indeed a<br />  Mountain. Just take case of Brahmaputra river. While we in India call<br />  it as Brahmaputra, the Chinese at it origin call it Yang Tse. Does it<br />  changes the character of the river? Similarly, the God remains unique<br />  in all aspects and He just acts the way He wishes, no matter what His<br />  creatures think of Him. Thinking that He is biased is the limitation<br />  of the Jeevatma. He is definitely not bound by what the Jeeva thinks.<br />  The moment one says that He is bounded by what the Jeevatma thinks of<br />  Him, then immediately the Supremity of the God is put to question as<br />  how can a person, who can be questioned for His acts, be called a<br />  Supreme Being or Brahman.</p>
<p>  And I would never think that the Azhwars and Nayanmars were doing Lip<br />  Service when they said that "It is Him who acts and not them the<br />  mortals". They had absolute faith on this aspect of God and that is<br />  what is the essence of their wonderful pourings.</p>
<p>  Finally as I said in the caveat above, let me give you the supporting<br />  verses which confirm that there is no "one correct" method to reach<br />  the God.</p>
<p>  Nammazhwar says in Thiruviruttham,</p>
<p>  vaNangum thuRigaL pala pala Akki, madhi vikaRppAl<br />  piNangum samayam pala pala Akki, avai avai thORu<br />  aNangum pala pala Akki, nin mUrthy parappi vaithhAi<br />  iNangu innOrai illai, nin kaN vEtkai yezhuvippanE.</p>
<p>  The essence of the above pAsuram is that:- He has created so many<br />  religions and hence so many ways for the Jeevatma to attain Him and<br />  then He is present as the Supreme God in every Religion of the world<br />  and such God is created a non-ending thirst on part of the Azhwar to<br />  reach His lotus feet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>  This is the proof that every religion, sect, subsect et all are just<br />  different routes to attain God.</p>
<p>  And finally, God Himself ensures that all His creations reach Him<br />  back when He wishes. Nammazhwar, again, this time in Thiruvaimozhi,<br />  says, "avar avar vidhi vazhi adaya ninRanarE" in the first decad and<br />  in the penultimate decad says " vaikuntham puguvadhu maNNavar<br />  vidihyE". This two gives a better understanding of what is Destiny<br />  or "vidhi". That, everyone born in this world are destined to reach<br />  Him and that Destiny is He Himself and His wishes.</p>
<p>  The fact that everyone reaches Him finally is also corroborated by<br />  Thirumangai Azhwar. I have quoted this just two days back</p>
<p>  "manjADu varai yEzhum, vAnagamum maNNagamum, maRRum ellAm<br />  enjAmal vayiRRadakki Alin mEl Or iLam thaLiril kaN vaLarndha eesan"</p>
<p>  So, forgetting the fact that one sect is ascribing to this<br />  philosophy, when one does a logical analysis, then I am sure they<br />  will come to this conclusion.</p>
<p>  In fact this is exactly why I wanted our members to come out with an<br />  answer of what they perceive their Ideal God to possess as.</p>
<p>  I dont know if I was able to satisfy your query. Please let me know<br />  if you need more clarifications on this perspective.</p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh</p>
<p>    I would be grateful for an explanation from your point of view.<br />    Thank you.</p>

<p>      Smt Malathi,</p>
<p>      You said:<br />      ==================Quote========================<br />      That is a great philosphy as long as I am not subject to one of<br />      those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe lose a child or<br />      anything else. If that happens it can and it will turn to great<br />      hatred against Him.Now am not implying everyone who has cruel<br />  things<br />      happen cannot believe in a personal God many people do but these<br />  are<br />      just some challenges with that approach.<br />      ==================Unquote=======================</p>
<p>      You are very correct in this observation. We do see many people<br />      saying "kadavulE unakku karuNayE illayA...." etc, when they<br />      encounter such tragedies in their life. And like you said, there<br />  are<br />      indeed some who even stop believing in His existence.</p>
<p>      But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism<br />  Philosophy<br />      perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief<br />  on<br />      Him, is done by Him only.</p>
<p>      Thirumazhisai Azhwar, in his Thiruchandhaviruttham says,</p>
<p>      naccharAvaNaik kidantha nAtha! nin pAdha pOdhinil vaitha sindhai,<br />      vAnguvitthu nInguivikka, nee inam meithan vallai AdhalAl,<br />  aRindhanan<br />      nin mAyamE, mayakkal ennai mAyanE</p>
<p>      Meaning, Oh my Lord who lies on the Snake Bed! You are capable of<br />      giving the thoughts about You to your creation, and also capable<br />  of<br />      taking it back. So please do not do that(taking away your<br />  thoughts)<br />      to me. I know you!!!</p>
<p>      Again, this signifies the fact that He controls everything and<br />      anything in the world and this has to be Natural to Him as He is<br />  the<br />      sole proprietor of the creation and also the master.</p>
<p>      The above pAsuram just re-iterates the present day movie songs<br />  that<br />      I quoted earlier. "nAyakan mElirundhu..." and "kaNNanE<br />      kAttinAn...kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".</p>
<p>      Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be<br />  so<br />      merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as<br />  the<br />      Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there<br />  would<br />      be no doubt in anyone's mind about what He can do, considering<br />  the<br />      Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.</p>
<p>      This is the essence of Hinduism devoid of all the differences<br />      between the Godheads etc. And this Supreme Being according to<br />      Vaishnvaites is Vishnu and Saivites is Siva. Just being called by<br />      different names. What I mean to say is, keeping aside the<br />      visualisation of the Form (I mean, having Sangu-Chakram means<br />  Vishnu<br />      and Maan-Mazhu means Siva) when one tries to fit the God in the<br />      above role of having Absolute Supremacy over everything, then<br />  Siva<br />      and Vishnu are none but the same Supreme Being.</p>
<p>      This is what is glorified by Peyazhwar too,</p>
<p>      thAzh sadaiyum (Siva) nIL mudiyum (Vishnu) oN mazhuvum (Siva)<br />      chakkaramum (Vishnu) sUzh aravum (Siva) pon nANum (Vishnu)<br />  thOndRum<br />      mAL. Here "mAl" refers to being Supreme. The Azhwars saw<br />  everything<br />      as "mAl". Just that they visualised Him that way.</p>
<p>      Which is why the saying "Ariyum Sivanum Ondru"</p>

        <p>Dear Satish,</p>
<p>I am a little confused here. When you say the Atma is Free, what do <br />you mean to say? Is it free from the Karmic Bondage or is it free to <br />act on its own.</p>
<p>Apart from the above doubt, the other things what you have said are <br />very valid. And I am no expert. Just that my teacher taught me to <br />question the rationale behind every claim, keeping aside the <br />hagiologies and other mystic references. The moment we keep these two <br />aside, we start to analyise purely based on Logic only and this is <br />what is true rationality or Pagutharivu.</p>
<p>With the statement that you have made below, even you are an expert <br />here Satish.</p>
<p>=========Quote=============</p>
<blockquote><p>  So whatever we feel/do, let it be free will or slavery, nothing<br />  is wrong as long as we try to move forward towards the ultimate<br />  sathya.<br />========Unquote============</p></blockquote>
<p>This is precisely what I said earlier as "avar avar vidhi vazhi adaya <br />ninRanarE" and "vaikuntham puguvadhu maNNavar vidhiyE"</p>

<blockquote><p>  I am no expert like VV, Ravi et al.</p>
<p>  Just trying to put forth what I understand.</p>
<p>  The first step of bondage of the self is to think that we are not<br />  free. The atman is free and till we recognize it we are caught in <br />the<br />  samsara sagaram. This is because we attribute every action to 'I',<br />  thinking that I am doing this, I am doing that. This 'I' is the <br />cause<br />  of Karma. Once we relinquish this 'I' and do our duty, then we are <br />not<br />  bound by karma. Very difficult to realize and attain this and trying<br />  to do things without expecting results is the first step of <br />karmayoga.</p>
<p>  Easiest way is bakthi yoga, where we surrender to the God saying<br />  everything is yours, whatever I do is because of you. When we come <br />to<br />  this state,as VV referred as 'willing slaves', then we dont take<br />  responsibility of our actions, and slowly the 'I' in us will be<br />  dissolved and we can be free. Till then, yes, there is no free will<br />  but the struggle of life is only to be free.</p>
<p>  There is nothing called wrong or right in this world. There is only<br />  'sathya', and if we say someone is doing a mistake, it means that <br />they<br />  are moving from a lower truth to higher truth to attain the ultimate<br />  truth. So whatever we feel/do, let it be free will or slavery, <br />nothing<br />  is wrong as long as we try to move forward towards the ultimate <br />sathya.</p>

<p>Just my two cents worth.</p>
<p>But before that a Caveat: As said earlier, this is based on <br />philosophies of one particular sect. Does not necessarily mean that <br />this is the only correct view. It still could be, from a human point <br />of view but from the all-mercy Almighty's point of view, there can be <br />absolutely nothing wrong. For Him, everything is just correct. I will <br />explain the supporting verses for this caveat later.</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "atpu555" <atpu555@...  wrote:</p></atpu555@...></p>
<blockquote><p>  Does this mean that we don't have any 'free will' at all?<br />  If that is the case, how do we accumulate our Karma in the first <br />place?</p>
<p>  I thought that when we say 'All Thy Will' as all the <br />  Thevaaram/Thiruvaasagam/Paasurams are saying, it is an attitude of <br />mind to <br />  have, in order to surrender to Him and annhililate our Ego.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, according to this philosophy, there is absolutely no free will <br />on part of the Athma. This, is a point of debate between various <br />sects of Hinduism and even within Srivaishnavism itself. Some say <br />that the Atma is indeed given a free will first, and based on its <br />initial action, the good or bad karma starts accumulating for the <br />Atma. This case is presented, so that one shall not say that the God <br />is biased when He supposedly blesses some while troubling (I wouldn't <br />call it a punishment) others for no mistake of the Atma.</p>
<p>And some others say that the Athma is absolutely independant and <br />hence the karma accrues to it according to its deed.</p>
<p>A Logical Rational Analysis:- </p>
<p>The people who ascribe a "Free Will" to Atma just to ensure that no <br />one says anything wrong on the part of the God, forget the fact that <br />when there is absolutely no one equal to or greater than Him, no <br />blame accumulate on His part. When He is THE Supreme Being and the <br />owner of everything, just about everything, then can't He act the way <br />He wishes? Why should He be bound by what the mere humans, created by <br />Him thinks? </p>
<p>On the other hand, the supporters of "No Free Will" just resign to <br />the fact that He is the Sarva Swami (Swami-means the absolute owner <br />of everything) and that we are all willing slaves. No matter whatever <br />we think about Him, He is what He is. Just think about this. No <br />matter what a person thinks about it, a Mountain is indeed a <br />Mountain. Just take case of Brahmaputra river. While we in India call <br />it as Brahmaputra, the Chinese at it origin call it Yang Tse. Does it <br />changes the character of the river? Similarly, the God remains unique <br />in all aspects and He just acts the way He wishes, no matter what His <br />creatures think of Him. Thinking that He is biased is the limitation <br />of the Jeevatma. He is definitely not bound by what the Jeeva thinks. <br />The moment one says that He is bounded by what the Jeevatma thinks of <br />Him, then immediately the Supremity of the God is put to question as <br />how can a person, who can be questioned for His acts, be called a <br />Supreme Being or Brahman.</p>
<p>And I would never think that the Azhwars and Nayanmars were doing Lip <br />Service when they said that "It is Him who acts and not them the <br />mortals". They had absolute faith on this aspect of God and that is <br />what is the essence of their wonderful pourings.</p>
<p>Finally as I said in the caveat above, let me give you the supporting <br />verses which confirm that there is no "one correct" method to reach <br />the God. </p>
<p>Nammazhwar says in Thiruviruttham,</p>
<p>vaNangum thuRigaL pala pala Akki, madhi vikaRppAl<br />piNangum samayam pala pala Akki, avai avai thORu<br />aNangum pala pala Akki, nin mUrthy parappi vaithhAi<br />iNangu innOrai illai, nin kaN vEtkai yezhuvippanE.</p>
<p>The essence of the above pAsuram is that:- He has created so many <br />religions and hence so many ways for the Jeevatma to attain Him and <br />then He is present as the Supreme God in every Religion of the world <br />and such God is created a non-ending thirst on part of the Azhwar to <br />reach His lotus feet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This is the proof that every religion, sect, subsect et all are just <br />different routes to attain God. </p>
<p>And finally, God Himself ensures that all His creations reach Him <br />back when He wishes. Nammazhwar, again, this time in Thiruvaimozhi, <br />says, "avar avar vidhi vazhi adaya ninRanarE" in the first decad and <br />in the penultimate decad says " vaikuntham puguvadhu maNNavar <br />vidihyE". This two gives a better understanding of what is Destiny <br />or "vidhi". That, everyone born in this world are destined to reach <br />Him and that Destiny is He Himself and His wishes.</p>
<p>The fact that everyone reaches Him finally is also corroborated by <br />Thirumangai Azhwar. I have quoted this just two days back</p>
<p>"manjADu varai yEzhum, vAnagamum maNNagamum, maRRum ellAm<br />enjAmal vayiRRadakki Alin mEl Or iLam thaLiril kaN vaLarndha eesan"</p>
<p>So, forgetting the fact that one sect is ascribing to this <br />philosophy, when one does a logical analysis, then I am sure they <br />will come to this conclusion.</p>
<p>In fact this is exactly why I wanted our members to come out with an <br />answer of what they perceive their Ideal God to possess as. </p>
<p>I dont know if I was able to satisfy your query. Please let me know <br />if you need more clarifications on this perspective.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>    Smt Malathi,</p>
<p>    You said:<br />    ==================Quote========================<br />    That is a great philosphy as long as I am not subject to one of <br />    those inexplicable perhaps cruel acts - maybe lose a child or <br />    anything else. If that happens it can and it will turn to great <br />    hatred against Him.Now am not implying everyone who has cruel <br />things <br />    happen cannot believe in a personal God many people do but these <br />are <br />    just some challenges with that approach.<br />    ==================Unquote=======================</p>
<p>    You are very correct in this observation. We do see many people <br />    saying "kadavulE unakku karuNayE illayA...." etc, when they <br />    encounter such tragedies in their life. And like you said, there <br />are <br />    indeed some who even stop believing in His existence. </p>
<p>    But I would say, again from the Thenkalai Srivaishnavism <br />Philosophy <br />    perspective, even this act of making a person to have dis-belief <br />on <br />    Him, is done by Him only. </p>
<p>    Thirumazhisai Azhwar, in his Thiruchandhaviruttham says,</p>
<p>    naccharAvaNaik kidantha nAtha! nin pAdha pOdhinil vaitha sindhai, <br />    vAnguvitthu nInguivikka, nee inam meithan vallai AdhalAl, <br />aRindhanan <br />    nin mAyamE, mayakkal ennai mAyanE</p>
<p>    Meaning, Oh my Lord who lies on the Snake Bed! You are capable of <br />    giving the thoughts about You to your creation, and also capable <br />of <br />    taking it back. So please do not do that(taking away your <br />thoughts) <br />    to me. I know you!!! </p>
<p>    Again, this signifies the fact that He controls everything and <br />    anything in the world and this has to be Natural to Him as He is <br />the <br />    sole proprietor of the creation and also the master.</p>
<p>    The above pAsuram just re-iterates the present day movie songs <br />that <br />    I quoted earlier. "nAyakan mElirundhu..." and "kaNNanE <br />    kAttinAn...kaNNanE kolai seigindrAn".</p>
<p>    Maybe very difficult to digest that the God, whom we expect to be <br />so <br />    merciful, can even do bad things. But when one looks upon Him as <br />the <br />    Master of all and that we are all "willing" slaves, then there <br />would <br />    be no doubt in anyone's mind about what He can do, considering <br />the <br />    Absolute Supremacy that He has on this world.</p>
<p>    This is the essence of Hinduism devoid of all the differences <br />    between the Godheads etc. And this Supreme Being according to <br />    Vaishnvaites is Vishnu and Saivites is Siva. Just being called by <br />    different names. What I mean to say is, keeping aside the <br />    visualisation of the Form (I mean, having Sangu-Chakram means <br />Vishnu <br />    and Maan-Mazhu means Siva) when one tries to fit the God in the <br />    above role of having Absolute Supremacy over everything, then <br />Siva <br />    and Vishnu are none but the same Supreme Being. </p>
<p>    This is what is glorified by Peyazhwar too,</p>
<p>    thAzh sadaiyum (Siva) nIL mudiyum (Vishnu) oN mazhuvum (Siva) <br />    chakkaramum (Vishnu) sUzh aravum (Siva) pon nANum (Vishnu) <br />thOndRum <br />    mAL. Here "mAl" refers to being Supreme. The Azhwars saw <br />everything <br />    as "mAl". Just that they visualised Him that way. </p>
<p>    Which is why the saying "Ariyum Sivanum Ondru"</p>
<p>    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>

        <p>Sathish,</p>
<p>Very rational analysis. In fact I have heard it (Kanchi Periyava's <br />stance) too. That is true. The very reason the Vedas were called <br />Sruthi is just because of the fact that they were only Heard for by-<br />hearting.</p>
<p>I realised this myself. The teacher who teaches me the Azhwars' <br />Prabhandams, allowed me to keep the book open for the first 5 days, <br />just to get a grasp of the words clearly, from the 6th day onwards, <br />he ordered me to close the book. The reason he gave was that if we <br />keep the book open, we will not be able to memorise it fast and even <br />if we do so we will forget it soon. </p>
<p>Believe me, I just remember whatever he taught me, with the books <br />closed for the next 10-12 days. </p>
<p>One more perspective to add to what you said. In those days, <br />personally I would say that, they were more conservative and there <br />would have been strong opposition and criticism for any new ideas. <br />Even today we see that most of the elders object to everything new <br />that is tried to infuse in some of the traditional practices. In <br />those days it would have been more.</p>
<p>I dont know about others, but atleast in Srivaishnavism it is very <br />much. In fact I am pretty sure that most of the Iyengars who are <br />supposed to be very traditional, would really term me an outcaste <br />when I said "ariyum Sivanum OnRu", though that is the fact <br />considering the "true" nature of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>Why I am saying all these is because, when there can be so much <br />resistance even in these times, think of the resistance that would <br />have been there 3000 years back or even more. So I am sure, like you, <br />that there could not have been much of creepings happening. But at <br />the same time definitely a lot of "idaicherugals" have happened in <br />the last millennium or so. Take for example the statement made by the <br />Central Government in the Ramasethu case regarding Rama breaking the <br />bridge while returning back from SriLanka. They even quoted <br />supporting verses from Kamba Ramayanam, taking cue from the "urai" <br />pubished by VM Gopalakrishnamachariar. I have that book myself and <br />yes, as quoted by the Government, the verses that confirm this <br />statement are indeed present in that. But remember that many Tamizh <br />scholars have rejected a lot of verses in Kamba Ramayanam as <br />idaicherugals, not after the start of the Ramasethu controversy but <br />atleast 3 or 4 decades back, when there was apparently no controversy <br />and the project was itself in the godown.</p>
<p>So I would say that, with time, when the sincerity &amp; honesty of the <br />Human race took the beating, the idaichergals started and looking <br />back at the history, this is more to have happened only in the last <br />millennium or even starting just 5 centuries back. Surely during the <br />times between VyAsa and Vaisampayana, just for 3 generations, I <br />presume it could not have happened. </p>
<p>But all that we say (either Your statement or Malathi's statement) <br />are only "possibilities" and we can't conclude until we have ample <br />proofs.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Thats where we differ from our ancestors. Till the British came to<br />  India and started documenting everything, the mode of education in<br />  India was by sishya parampara. Guru teaches the sishya, sishya has <br />to<br />  memorize it, upside down,downside up and what not. In veda's we call<br />  it gana padam.....repeating everything in the reverse order. Even<br />  today we say thalai keezh paadam...thookathula ezhupi ketalum <br />theriyanum.</p>
<p>  That was the quality of education we had and if that was the case,<br />  just 100 years back, we are talking about nearly 5000 years where <br />the<br />  human mind would have been more clear to remember things. So 3 <br />degrees<br />  of narration and errors...I dont think that crept in....then we <br />would<br />  have lost almost all the veda's and upanishads by now. </p>
<p>  Kanchi mahaperiyaval says that,we started forgeting things only <br />after<br />  documenting them. If there is no documents, we will strive to<br />  remember, if we have a book, we will lazy thinking, ok i have the<br />  book, I can refer to it anytime, but we will never refer. Thats why<br />  the people who knew sanskrit and veda's have come down drastically <br />in<br />  just a century, whereas our forefathers have preserved for eons <br />together.</p>

<p>    Also to remember the Mahabharat as written by Vyasa was related by<br />  his grandson Vaishampayana to Arjuna's grandson Janamejaya in the<br />  great 'sarpa yagna'. As I understand whatever we have now is the<br />  record of Vaishampayana's narration, not Vyasa's original. There <br />fore<br />  3 degrees of narration within the same epic it is wholly possible<br />  things were left out, added and so on.</p></blockquote>
