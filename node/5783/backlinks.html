<p>Dear Vijay / Venkatesh,</p>
<p>The pattern of Grants by Kulothunga II indicate ::</p>
<p>He converted the names of certain villages as Anabaya Nallur; Most of the grants in TN - Tindivanam (Ennayiram) - Chidambaram<br />belt ..to Siva temples; In Andra and Karnataka, he has given grants to 2 Vinnagarams.</p>
<p>When I spoke to a Scholar on this, he opined :</p>
<p>The Sculpture in worship might have become NIRMALYAM (during<br />renovation or for some other reason) and so might have been put<br />under Sea Waters ..</p>
<p>Ottakoothar also says : " Mundril kidantha .. "</p>

<p>Mundril is Front yard ..</p>
<p>Possible that Kulothunga II reverently put the NIRMALYAM of Shree<br />Vishnu Idol - kept in the Front yard - in the Sea ..</p>
<p>With his leaning towards Jainism in early days - Not hurting being<br />primary .. - it is unlikely a Ruling King would have caused such hurt<br />to his subjects of specific Faith..</p>

        <p>Hi<br />i guess we have started going around in circles.<br />all information that can be had on the above event have been shared <br />and different views expressed.<br />i think this has been one of the most satisfying discussions ever had <br />in the group or for the matter on the net on this subject.<br />if sps could sum up the points we could consider it a grand finale <br />to the discussion on the govindaraja- kulothunga 2 event.<br />of course we have kamal to thank for stirring up the hornet's nest!!</p>

<p>      I am afraid, I am not able to understand when you say that the<br />      entire discussion is based on that. I thought we were discussing<br />      about the authencity of the incident of Govindarajar being <br />thrown<br />      into sea.</p>
<p>    Hi, questions are simple if we see them as such - if indeed we <br />were<br />    to take ottakuthan in literal terms - siru deviam - was he talking<br />    of the massive reclining vishnu stone statue or a smaller standing<br />    vishnu sculpture..</p>
<p>  Take the words Siru Deivam and "thollai" in tandem and you will <br />conclude<br />  that it has nothing to do with the size of idol but the concept.</p>
<p>    . Remember, in your own words,<br />      Lingothbavar was the central theme and others are participating<br />      artists.</p>
<p>    sorry mu friend - urdhva thandavam and lingothbava central theme<br />    itself is different. there is an inherent depiction of who is<br />    superior here. here too early versions only showed the varaha and<br />    swan - but later versions added a praying vishnu and brahma for<br />    effect!!!</p>
<p>  Sorry, I meant Urdhva Thandavam but wrongly mentioned about<br />  Lingothbavar.</p>
<p>    show me one verse composed by a poet,<br />      singing about a King's tolearance level, by terming Siva as a <br />Siru<br />      Dheivam. Atleast I am not aware of one. Please do not take the<br />      references the verses by Azhwars or Nayanmars as you know what <br />to<br />      expect out of them.</p>
<p>    you have already read the inscrptions on the kanchi kailasantha<br />    temple being closed, lands handed over to another temple...need <br />help<br />    in deciphering temple of anaiyapadangavudaiyanayanar. we are not<br />    aware of why though?</p>
<p>  Fine. But as you yourself say that the reasons for a close down are <br />not<br />  clear. So where is a word there which belittles Siva? I am afraid <br />there<br />  is none, or did I miss some thing blatantly, which refers to such<br />  belittlement.</p>
<p>      Also the same King who built such a Siva temple would have <br />built a<br />      Vishnu temple in which Siva would have a demi-god status. But is<br />      there any account which claims that Kulothunga II, threw away a<br />      Sivalingam or a Nataraja into sea or fire to find more place <br />for a<br />      Vishnu Sannidhi. I am afraid not. So my statement regarding the<br />      Prejudiced opinion about the Chola kings, making it difficult to<br />      accept the intolerance towards Vaishnavites (of course I am<br />      referring only to Kulothunga II here) still stands valid,<br />    logically.</p>
<p>        history abunds with such U turns of rulers - especially with<br />      regard<br />        to faith - but there is always a cause effect - for eg, why <br />did<br />        rajendra launch his naval assault on a kingdom that was so <br />close<br />      to<br />        his dad. we are not here to justify the act - but first of all<br />    to<br />        see if the act actually happened and if so why ???</p>
<p>      I donot understand what you are trying to convey here,especially<br />      with respect to my statement in quotes.</p>
<p>    i have no doubts in my mind as to the very act - there was a<br />    skirmish and the king did something - an idol was dropped into the<br />    sea...but i wouldnt call it intolerance - there had to be some<br />    provocation. if we can step back and analyse what would have<br />    prompted the king to do this act...we might get some answers</p>
<p>  Yes, it is also recorded that there was an objection from the<br />  Vaishnavites to demolish the existing temple, for expanding the <br />Nataraja<br />  Sannidhi. If this can be treated as a provocation, remember a <br />tolerant<br />  king, ideally, would only punish those who objected and created <br />problem.<br />  Not the Idol. So, if due to the provocation by the Vaishnavite <br />priests<br />  if Kulothunga II threw Govindarajar into the sea, it is only his<br />  audacity and there is absolutely no reverence in this act as <br />suggested<br />  by SPS sir. This is what I am trying to convey.</p>
<p>  So it is a fact that Kulothunga II had much lesser tolerance. Okay <br />let<br />  us not term it as intolerance, but lesser reverence to Vishnu when<br />  compared to Siva and that is what made him to throw the idol in the <br />sea.<br />  So we agree that the incident actually took place, but you only <br />want to<br />  know what was the provocation. I have stated the provocation too. <br />So how<br />  are we going to absolve Kulothunga II from the allegations of<br />  intolerance (or) irreverance?</p>

<p>sorry mu friend - urdhva thandavam and lingothbava central theme <br />itself is different. there is an inherent depiction of who is <br />superior here. here too early versions only showed the varaha and <br />swan - but later versions added a praying vishnu and brahma for <br />effect!!!</p>
<p>show me one verse composed by a poet, </p>
<blockquote><p>  singing about a King's tolearance level, by terming Siva as a Siru <br />  Dheivam. Atleast I am not aware of one. Please do not take the <br />  references the verses by Azhwars or Nayanmars as you know what to <br />  expect out of them. </p></blockquote>
<p>you have already read the inscrptions on the kanchi kailasantha <br />temple being closed, lands handed over to another temple...need help <br />in deciphering temple of anaiyapadangavudaiyanayanar. we are not <br />aware of why though?</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  Also the same King who built such a Siva temple would have built a <br />  Vishnu temple in which Siva would have a demi-god status. But is <br />  there any account which claims that Kulothunga II, threw away a <br />  Sivalingam or a Nataraja into sea or fire to find more place for a <br />  Vishnu Sannidhi. I am afraid not. So my statement regarding the <br />  Prejudiced opinion about the Chola kings, making it difficult to <br />  accept the intolerance towards Vaishnavites (of course I am <br />  referring only to Kulothunga II here) still stands valid, <br />logically.</p>
<p>    history abunds with such U turns of rulers - especially with <br />  regard <br />    to faith - but there is always a cause effect - for eg, why did <br />    rajendra launch his naval assault on a kingdom that was so close <br />  to <br />    his dad. we are not here to justify the act - but first of all <br />to <br />    see if the act actually happened and if so why ???</p>
<p>  I donot understand what you are trying to convey here,especially <br />  with respect to my statement in quotes.</p></blockquote>
<p>i have no doubts in my mind as to the very act - there was a <br />skirmish and the king did something - an idol was dropped into the <br />sea...but i wouldnt call it intolerance - there had to be some <br />provocation. if we can step back and analyse what would have <br />prompted the king to do this act...we might get some answers</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Mr Vijay,</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I never took it as an offense. However I accept <br />that I miread your intentions and apologise for the same while <br />thanking you for the clarifications. </p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br /><vj.episteme@...  wrote:</p></vj.episteme@...></p>
<blockquote><p>  Yes, in this sculptural composition, from the artist's perspective <br />  of the event being depicted - the central actor is shiva in his <br />  dance pose...the others are all - if i were to use the correct <br />tamil <br />  word ( again pl dont take offence) parivara dieties. </p></blockquote>
<p>No. Absolutely no offence taken either. As it is just customary on <br />the part of Vaishnavites to term Siva as a Parivara devatha, it is <br />cutomary on part of Saivites to term Vishnu as a Parivara devatha. I <br />am okay with this term definitely.</p>
<blockquote><p>  so now would <br />  you brand this beautiful piece of art an offencive sculpture ( <br />  considering that this is part of a one piece stone pillar - and <br />the <br />  craftmen has had the greatness to sculpt it to such perfection - <br />  even in that minute detail as to the sangu chakaram and the other <br />  attributes...) and compare this artist to ottakutan.</p></blockquote>
<p>fault the sculptor. Who knows, the same sculptor may have made <br />another in a Vishnu temple where he would have depicted Siva <br />prostrating before Vishnu. For him, it is his job. He has to carry <br />out his depiction according to the beliefs of the community for whom <br />he is building it. This is quite natural and hence no need to brand <br />him or the sculpture as offensive.</p>
<blockquote><p>  i would also take this as a positive depiction of the event - the <br />  idea was not to belittle either brahma, vishnu or paravathi - but <br />it <br />  shows that the presence of them as an audience to the dance - even <br />  one step further joyfully participating in it. </p></blockquote>
<p>Agreed absolutely.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Have you been to Thiruvananthapuram? Did you notice the very <br />small, <br />    rather smaller than that of Vishnu in Patteeswaram, Sivalingam, <br />  near <br />    the right hand of Ananthapadmanabhaswamy which is in <br />  a "protecting" <br />    posture? So, on your same argument lines, will you accept that <br />  Siva <br />    is also a "Siru Dheivam"? </p>
<p>  Of course, in the same line of thinking as above....the main idea <br />of <br />  the sculpture is sayana kolam of perumal. all the others are side <br />  actors...but just for argument sake - can you compare this with <br />the <br />  jala sayana perumal of mallai shore temple and search for the <br />lingam <br />  there...</p></blockquote>
<p>Perfect. The legends of the Sayana Perumal are different in <br />different locations. Remember I told that the Sthala Puranams are <br />nothing but a marketing tactic. Though this is true, the forms of <br />the murthys in those temples were made with this legend in mind. So <br />the legend for the Sayana posture in Thiruvanathapuram is very <br />different as that of Jala Sayana perumal in Mamallapuram. </p>
<blockquote><p>    And since when, the sculptures were used to conclude <br />the "siRumai" <br />    or "perumai" of a God? </p>
<p>  I thought that was the subject of this entire discussion - to me <br />the <br />  above two are not instigative...whereas a sarabeshwara ( believe <br />me <br />  you have to see the one on madurai gopuram) is something that we <br />can <br />  dispute /argue. in that same mature argument - the lingothbava <br />  legend finds mention and sculptural representations even during <br />the <br />  times when ( as per the information currently available to us) <br />there <br />  were no serious divisions between the two followers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am afraid, I am not able to understand when you say that the <br />entire discussion is based on that. I thought we were discussing <br />about the authencity of the incident of Govindarajar being thrown <br />into sea. </p>
<blockquote><p>    So, unless you intended this statement for fun, there is no <br />logic <br />  in <br />    trying to prove that Thirumal is a "siru dheivam" based on the <br />    Patteswaram sculpture as the vice versa is true from <br />    Thiruvananthapuram "moolasthAnam" itself.</p>
<p>  it was defn not for fun - i was doing a literal translation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I take it. Sorry for the misreading. </p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>    So, the fact that Ottakoothar represented the thoughts of <br />  Kulothunga <br />    II by calling Thirumal as "SiRu dheivam" is itself an <br />undisputable <br />    testimony to the intolerance of Kulothunga II</p>
<p>  every shiva temple has the lingothbavar depiction defined in its <br />  canons of construction - so you mean that depicting in stone <br />doesnt <br />  tantamoung to intolerance while a court poet's verse does!!</p></blockquote>
<p>This at best is a very clever question. Remember, in your own words, <br />Lingothbavar was the central theme and others are participating <br />artists. And there is always a constraint for the sculptor regarding <br />the space available and he will only depict the central character <br />largely. But the case of Poet is totally different. While one can <br />find an equal of a sculptural depiction on both sides (I mean <br />Saivite and Vaishnavite), show me one verse composed by a poet, <br />singing about a King's tolearance level, by terming Siva as a Siru <br />Dheivam. Atleast I am not aware of one. Please do not take the <br />references the verses by Azhwars or Nayanmars as you know what to <br />expect out of them. </p>
<p>Also the same King who built such a Siva temple would have built a <br />Vishnu temple in which Siva would have a demi-god status. But is <br />there any account which claims that Kulothunga II, threw away a <br />Sivalingam or a Nataraja into sea or fire to find more place for a <br />Vishnu Sannidhi. I am afraid not. So my statement regarding the <br />Prejudiced opinion about the Chola kings, making it difficult to <br />accept the intolerance towards Vaishnavites (of course I am <br />referring only to Kulothunga II here) still stands valid, logically.</p>
<blockquote><p>    But I see that, since an opinion is already formed about the <br />    generosity of the Chola Kings, it is hard to digest that one or <br />  two <br />    Chola Kings did exhibit some levels of intolerance. One need to <br />  have <br />    a paradigm shift to do an unbiased study to conclude. </p>
<p>  unbiased study - my kula deivam is yedukuntala vada - but that <br />  doesnt stop me from entering other temples not resctricted to <br />  hinduism alone, after all my friend we are at best 3rd in terms of <br />  world coverage.</p>
<p>    Afterall "yAnaikkum aDi sarukkum". I am not branding all Chola <br />  kings <br />    as Vaishnava haters, nor could I do it in the wake of available <br />    inscriptions which talk about there true reverence to all <br />Religion <br />    and not only Vaishnvaism. At the same time, let our pre-judice <br />not <br />    make us blind in accepting the facts as it is, when clearly <br />  evident.</p>
<p>  history abunds with such U turns of rulers - especially with <br />regard <br />  to faith - but there is always a cause effect - for eg, why did <br />  rajendra launch his naval assault on a kingdom that was so close <br />to <br />  his dad. we are not here to justify the act - but first of all to <br />  see if the act actually happened and if so why ???</p></blockquote>
<p>I donot understand what you are trying to convey here,especially <br />with respect to my statement in quotes.</p>
<blockquote><p>    PS: The "jingu chakka" is called as "thALam"</p>
<p>  thanks</p>
<p>  did you know of this...</p>
<p>  During kulottunga I, the kachi kailasanatha temple was closed down<br />  and the temple lands were given to another nearby temple.<br />  Subsequently during vijayanagara period ( his officer) koppangal<br />  cancelled this order and reopened the temple.</p>
<p>  South indian inscriptions:</p>
<p>  The three inscriptions Nos. 86, 87 and- 88 contain orders, which,<br />  were issued by a certain koppanangal/Koppannangal or Koppanan to <br />the<br />  authorities of the<br />  temple. Koppanangal -was probably the executive officer of Kambana-<br />  udaiyar at<br />  kanchipuram. The Kaiiasanattha Temple is designated, by three<br />  different names,<br />  Rajasimhavarmesvara,Edudattu-ayiram-u-daiya-nayanar and<br />  Tirukkarraliimahadeva. The last-mentioned term means "the holy <br />stone-<br />  temple (of) siva, The<br />  meaning of the second is not apparent. The first name,<br />  RajasimhayarmeSvara, shows<br />  that the Pallava king Rajasimha, the founder of the temple, was not<br />  yet forgotten at the<br />  times of Kambana-udaiyar, and that his full name was <br />Rajasimhavarman.</p>
<p>  Kulottunga-Chola-deva,<br />  the Rajasimhavarmesvara Temple at Kanchipuram had been closed, its<br />  landed property<br />  sold, and its compound and environs transferred to the temple of<br />  anaiyapadangavudaiyanayanar. Koppanangal ordered, that the temple<br />  should be reopened and that its property<br />  should be restored."</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>I am not aware of this. However I know of the character Koppana. He <br />was indeed the executive officer or a Chief Minister in the court of <br />Bukka and his son Kambana. He finds his name mentioned in Mathura <br />Vijayam a poem written by Kambana's wife regarding the Vijayanagar <br />Kingdoms invasion of the Islamic rulers of South India and <br />restoration of Srirangam and Madurai. His name also finds a mention <br />in the inscriptions on the walls of Srirangam temple and also in the <br />Koil Ozhugu for he was the principal man behind the efforts to <br />restore Ranganatha to Srirangam temple after 48 years of exile, <br />starting from the invasion of Ulugh Khan. </p>

        <p>dear venketesh,</p>
<p>No offence meant - but by seru i didnt mean the lord. we are talking <br />of the Gods of man's creation - to me true divinity is very much <br />different to this.

        <p>Mr Vijay,</p>
<p>If your intention is to conclude that ThirumAl is indeed a Siru <br />Deivam, I can only say that, at best this is a Perspective. For one <br />can show similar references where Siva is considered a Siru Dheivam. <br />Have you been to Thiruvananthapuram? Did you notice the very small, <br />rather smaller than that of Vishnu in Patteeswaram, Sivalingam, near <br />the right hand of Ananthapadmanabhaswamy which is in a "protecting" <br />posture? So, on your same argument lines, will you accept that Siva <br />is also a "Siru Dheivam"? </p>
<p>And since when, the sculptures were used to conclude the "siRumai" <br />or "perumai" of a God? </p>
<p>So, unless you intended this statement for fun, there is no logic in <br />trying to prove that Thirumal is a "siru dheivam" based on the <br />Patteswaram sculpture as the vice versa is true from <br />Thiruvananthapuram "moolasthAnam" itself.</p>
<p>So, the fact that Ottakoothar represented the thoughts of Kulothunga <br />II by calling Thirumal as "SiRu dheivam" is itself an undisputable <br />testimony to the intolerance of Kulothunga II</p>
<p>But I see that, since an opinion is already formed about the <br />generosity of the Chola Kings, it is hard to digest that one or two <br />Chola Kings did exhibit some levels of intolerance. One need to have <br />a paradigm shift to do an unbiased study to conclude. </p>
<p>Afterall "yAnaikkum aDi sarukkum". I am not branding all Chola kings <br />as Vaishnava haters, nor could I do it in the wake of available <br />inscriptions which talk about there true reverence to all Religion <br />and not only Vaishnvaism. At the same time, let our pre-judice not <br />make us blind in accepting the facts as it is, when clearly evident.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>
<p>PS: The "jingu chakka" is called as "thALam"</p>

<p>  Now brahma is shown with the chai chak sorry jalra ( opps sorry - <br />  ithukku per ennappa )....and vishnu is playing the drum. Now you <br />  cannot fault the sculpture /artist....for he is following the <br />  dicition ( watch the size of paravati in the entire composition) - <br />  interesting to note the the dwarf muhilagan's size in comparison <br />to <br />  vishnu, brahma and parvathi...</p>

<p>  As Siva commences his dance in the evening. Ratnakara imagines, in <br />  the<br />  loftiest terms the sun and moons as the cymbals used by the <br />goddess <br />  of<br />  prosperity herself for tala and laya, the most important in the <br />  nritta<br />  aspect of dance. At the commencement of dance by Siva at dusk, with<br />  the sun disc setting near the astagiri and the full moon emerging <br />  into<br />  light from his locks, it seems to make the celestial goddess of<br />  prosperity hold as it were these two as cymbals for the Lord's <br />  musical<br />  orchestra: <br />  astavalambiravibimbitayodayadsrichudonmishatsakalachandrataya<br />  cha sayam sandhyapranrittaharavadyagrihitakamsyataladvayeva<br />  samalakshyata nakalakshmih (Haravijya 19.5).</p>
<p>  This exacting musical orchestra, the vina played by the Lady of <br />  music,<br />  Sarasvati herself, the flute by Indra who excels, Brahma keeping <br />time<br />  and Vishnu himself sounding the drum, is because Siva himself is an<br />  adept in all the musical instruments. In the Sivasahasranama, <br />there <br />  is<br />  an elaboration of his musical accomplishments. He is described as<br />  Sarvaturyaninadi, he is also Vainavi, Panavi, Vini, Tali and Nali:<br />  vainavi panavi kalah kalakanthah katamkatah?.. vini cha panavi tali<br />  nail kalikatus tatha sarvaturyaninadi cha sarvavyuapyaparigrahah<br />  (Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 11) tumbuvino mahakopah vamsavadi <br />hyaninditah<br />  (Linegamahapurana 1, 65, 21) naikatanaratas svarah <br />(Lingamahapurana <br />  1,<br />  65, 40). The commentary here explains tumbu vina as the vina <br />provided<br />  with two gourds and popularly known as Rudra vina. Siva delights in<br />  innumerable murchhanas or tanas, and he is of the very nature of <br />the<br />  svaras, not only udatta, anudatta, svarita, but the sangita svaras,<br />  the seven famous notes. Siva is also called Rathagita: akshayo<br />  rathagitas cha (Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 44). Ratha is <br />Rathantarasama,<br />  by the chant of which he is invoked. Siva's fondness for Sama is <br />very<br />  well known.</p>

        <p>SPS Sir,</p>
<p>Here is the quote of Ottakoothar that I was searching for some time <br />now, </p>
<p>"thillaith thirumanRil munRil siRu dheivath thollaik kurumbu <br />tholaithu eDuthu..."</p>
<p>Please note the word "siRu deivam" referring to Govindarajar. The <br />same Govindarajar was glorified by the Azhwar as DevAdhi Devan. So <br />the fact that Ottakoothar has reflected the thoughts of Kulothunga II <br />that he considered the Vishnu as "siRu dheivam" speaks of his lesser <br />reverence for anyone other than Siva. </p>
<p>So your claim that "  Possible that Kulothunga II reverently put the <br />NIRMALYAM of Shree</p>
<blockquote><p>  Vishnu Idol - kept in the Front yard - in the Sea .." </p></blockquote>
<p>could not be possible as is clearly evident from the above quotes of <br />Ottakoothar. </p>
<p>And also from the earlier quotes about the 777th song of ThakkayAga <br />bharaNi "munRil kiDantha......pinnaith thillai manRiRkku iDam <br />kaNda....". Please note the words "manRiRkku iDam kaNDa", which <br />clearly indicates that Govindarajar was removed from His place only <br />to find more place for Nataraja. Also, assuming that Kulothunga II <br />treated the idol of Govindraja with reverence, how could one term the <br />action of placing idol in sea as with reverence. Lastly the issue <br />of "Nirmalyam" at best can be only a guess as there are no records. <br />Also if Nirmalyam was the case, then he would have re-erected a new <br />one, like in the case of Kanchipuram, where a new Idol was <br />consecrated when the old Idol made of "Atthi" tree became <br />disqualified for poojas. But he did not do this, right??</p>
<p>Correlating the words "siRu dheivam" and "manRiRkku iDam kaNDa", and <br />discounting the possibility of a Nirmalyam as it has no basis from <br />the Historical records, I am pretty sure, there could not have been <br />any reverence in the act on the part of Kulothunga II and his <br />intolerance levels are blatantly evident.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>
<p>PS: In my previous mail, I said that this act was expected to have <br />happened during 1127 AD. Sorry for the confusion. This could have <br />happened only after 1133 AD which means Ramanuja was more than 115 <br />years of age during the happening. </p>

<p>  Possible that Kulothunga II reverently put the NIRMALYAM of Shree<br />  Vishnu Idol - kept in the Front yard - in the Sea ..</p>
<p>  With his leaning towards Jainism in early days - Not hurting being<br />  primary .. - it is unlikely a Ruling King would have caused such <br />hurt<br />  to his subjects of specific Faith..</p>
<p>  I will move on to other subjects ..</p>

<p>    I've read the book and found it to be a total let-down. The 'Vengi<br />    throne' sub-plot in it is also amateurish. We've already discussed<br />    this topic in Message #8188.</p>
