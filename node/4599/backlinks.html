<p>FOR NEW MEMBERS AND EVERY MEMBER .. AGAIN !</p>
<p>On 8th July 2002, In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "sv24in" <br /><sumeetha_pb@...  wrote:</p>
<p>Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based <br />on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how <br />to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds while <br />we read this great epic &#150; "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by <br />any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we <br />get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />secret about her life.</p>
<p>Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. <br />When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but she <br />presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be <br />powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and she <br />also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally <br />beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her <br />beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it is <br />certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in the <br />novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her <br />little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick <br />puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava <br />Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is <br />unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan <br />escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the <br />reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get the <br />wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya spies <br />who want avenge their king's death. </p>
<p>Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure <br />that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after <br />Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. Karuthiruman <br />saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />emory <br />and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the <br />Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan fall <br />in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? </p>
<p>Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to <br />Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. <br />Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani, <br />Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of <br />Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />recognize him?</p>
<p>The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to Kodi <br />Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is back. <br />Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not <br />know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />lighthouse and her last accident. </p>
<p>Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her? <br />was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles <br />Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally <br />beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we <br />assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind <br />other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had <br />traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special love <br />or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out <br />what happened to her.</p>
<p>Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to <br />her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman <br />finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in <br />Chola household but before he could get this information to the king <br />he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows that <br />she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or to <br />their mother.</p>
<p>Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the <br />Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref: <br /><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That is <br />also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 &#150; 22 <br />years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. <br />Either way we get the same answer &#150; Nandini is Veerapandiyan's <br />daughter.</p>
<p>The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of <br />Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for the <br />Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must <br />vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he <br />starts with a preamble that &#150; "Is it Ok if I combine some <br />imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it is <br />imagination is difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to <br />Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and <br />Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody <br />to wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes <br />place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's <br />house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from the <br />Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back at <br />the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan was <br />her father? <br />What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw Nandini? <br />I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that <br />Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must have <br />told her so as well.</p>
<p>But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in the <br />presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she <br />have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she had <br />realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her <br />brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />logic!</p>
<p>Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him <br />if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she <br />needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and <br />that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into a <br />mad rage. </p>
<p>Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She <br />had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her <br />wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in <br />his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.</p>
<p>Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have <br />meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even <br />Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's <br />daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan <br />the way she did. </p>
<p>Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else <br />thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>

<p>  FOR NEW MEMBERS AND EVERY MEMBER .. AGAIN !</p>
<p>  On 8th July 2002, In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "sv24in" <br />  <sumeetha_pb@  wrote:</p>
<p>  Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>  When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based <br />  on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how <br />  to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />  begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds <br />while <br />  we read this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>  I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by <br />  any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />  entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we <br />  get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />  secret about her life.</p>
<p>  Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />  that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />  woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. <br />  When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but <br />she <br />  presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />  listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />  helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />  when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be <br />  powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and she <br />  also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>  After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally <br />  beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her <br />  beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it <br />is <br />  certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in <br />the <br />  novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her <br />  little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick <br />  puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava <br />  Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is <br />  unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>  The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />  flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan <br />  escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>  Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the <br />  reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get <br />the <br />  wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya <br />spies <br />  who want avenge their king's death. </p>
<p>  Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />  mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />  unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>  Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure <br />  that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />  Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>  I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />  because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after <br />  Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>  The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. <br />Karuthiruman <br />  saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />  emory <br />  and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />  Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>  Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the <br />  Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan <br />fall <br />  in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? </p>
<p>  Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. <br />  Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani, <br />  Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of <br />  Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />  recognize him?</p>
<p>  The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />  individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />  Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to <br />Kodi <br />  Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />  Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is back. <br />  Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not <br />  know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />  lighthouse and her last accident. </p>
<p>  Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her? <br />  was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles <br />  Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally <br />  beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we <br />  assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />  because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />  Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />  been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />  rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind <br />  other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had <br />  traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special love <br />  or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out <br />  what happened to her.</p>
<p>  Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to <br />  her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman <br />  finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in <br />  Chola household but before he could get this information to the <br />king <br />  he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows <br />that <br />  she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or <br />to <br />  their mother.</p>
<p>  Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />  Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the <br />  Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref: <br />  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That is <br />  also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ? 22 <br />  years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. <br />  Either way we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan's <br />  daughter.</p>
<p>  The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of <br />  Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />  suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for <br />the <br />  Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must <br />  vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he <br />  starts with a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I combine some <br />  imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it is <br />  imagination is difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>  After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />  Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to <br />  Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and <br />  Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody <br />  to wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>  When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes <br />  place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's <br />  house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from <br />the <br />  Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back <br />at <br />  the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />  Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan <br />was <br />  her father? <br />  What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw Nandini? <br />  I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that <br />  Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must <br />have <br />  told her so as well.</p>
<p>  But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />  Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in <br />the <br />  presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she <br />  have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />  Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she <br />had <br />  realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her <br />  brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />  logic!</p>
<p>  Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him <br />  if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she <br />  needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />  plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and <br />  that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into <br />a <br />  mad rage. </p>
<p>  Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She <br />  had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her <br />  wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in <br />  his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.</p>
<p>  Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have <br />  meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even <br />  Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />  where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>  Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's <br />  daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan <br />  the way she did. </p>
<p>  Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else <br />  thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />  unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>

<p>    I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />    because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years <br />after <br />    Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>    The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. <br />  Karuthiruman <br />    saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />    emory <br />    and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />    Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>    Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the <br />    Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan <br />  fall <br />    in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? </p>
<p>    Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses <br />to <br />    Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and <br />Madhuranthakan. <br />    Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with <br />Vani, <br />    Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded <br />of <br />    Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />    recognize him?</p>
<p>    The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />    individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />    Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to <br />  Kodi <br />    Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />    Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is <br />back. <br />    Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does <br />not <br />    know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />    lighthouse and her last accident. </p>
<p>    Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to <br />her? <br />    was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini <br />resembles <br />    Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an <br />exceptionally <br />    beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If <br />we <br />    assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />    because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />    Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />    been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />    rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in <br />mind <br />    other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he <br />had <br />    traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special <br />love <br />    or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find <br />out <br />    what happened to her.</p>
<p>    Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened <br />to <br />    her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? <br />Karuthiruman <br />    finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in <br />    Chola household but before he could get this information to the <br />  king <br />    he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows <br />  that <br />    she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies <br />or <br />  to <br />    their mother.</p>
<p>    Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />    Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of <br />the <br />    Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref: <br />    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That is <br />    also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ? 22 <br />    years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on <br />Nandini. <br />    Either way we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan's <br />    daughter.</p>
<p>    The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father <br />of <br />    Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />    suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for <br />  the <br />    Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />    Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must <br />    vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he <br />    starts with a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I combine some <br />    imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it <br />is <br />    imagination is difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>    After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />    Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />    Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini <br />to <br />    Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini <br />and <br />    Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want <br />anybody <br />    to wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>    When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes <br />    place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's <br />    house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from <br />  the <br />    Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get <br />back <br />  at <br />    the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />    Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan <br />  was <br />    her father? <br />    What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw <br />Nandini? <br />    I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact <br />that <br />    Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must <br />  have <br />    told her so as well.</p>
<p>    But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />    Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in <br />  the <br />    presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could <br />she <br />    have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />    Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she <br />  had <br />    realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call <br />her <br />    brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply <br />any <br />    logic!</p>
<p>    Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill <br />him <br />    if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she <br />    needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she <br />had <br />    plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man <br />and <br />    that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got <br />into <br />  a <br />    mad rage. </p>
<p>    Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. <br />She <br />    had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her <br />    wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan <br />in <br />    his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her <br />lover.</p>
<p>    Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might <br />have <br />    meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. <br />Even <br />    Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />    where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>    Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's <br />    daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on <br />Karikalan <br />    the way she did. </p>
<p>    Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody <br />else <br />    thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />    unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>

<p>  FOR NEW MEMBERS AND EVERY MEMBER .. AGAIN !</p>
<p>  On 8th July 2002, In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "sv24in" <br />  <sumeetha_pb@  wrote:</p>
<p>  Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>  When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based <br />  on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how <br />  to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />  begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds <br />while <br />  we read this great epic &#150; "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>  I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by <br />  any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />  entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we <br />  get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />  secret about her life.</p>
<p>  Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />  that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />  woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. <br />  When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but <br />she <br />  presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />  listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />  helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />  when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be <br />  powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and she <br />  also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>  After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally <br />  beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her <br />  beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it <br />is <br />  certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in <br />the <br />  novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her <br />  little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick <br />  puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava <br />  Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is <br />  unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>  The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />  flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan <br />  escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>  Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the <br />  reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get <br />the <br />  wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya <br />spies <br />  who want avenge their king's death. </p>
<p>  Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />  mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />  unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>  Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure <br />  that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />  Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>  I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />  because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after <br />  Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>

<p>  Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. <br />  Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani, <br />  Mandakini's twin sister.

<p>  FOR NEW MEMBERS AND EVERY MEMBER .. AGAIN !</p>
<p>  On 8th July 2002, In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "sv24in" <br />  <sumeetha_pb@  wrote:</p>
<p>  Who is Nandini?</p>
<p>  When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article based <br />  on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering how <br />  to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />  begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds <br />while <br />  we read this great epic ? "Who is Nandini?"</p>
<p>  I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by <br />  any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />  entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we <br />  get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />  secret about her life.</p>
<p>  Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />  that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />  woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. <br />  When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but <br />she <br />  presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />  listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />  helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />  when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to be <br />  powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and she <br />  also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.</p>
<p>  After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an exceptionally <br />  beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare her <br />  beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it <br />is <br />  certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in <br />the <br />  novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her <br />  little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love sick <br />  puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava <br />  Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who is <br />  unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.</p>
<p>  The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />  flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya Devan <br />  escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.</p>
<p>  Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the <br />  reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get <br />the <br />  wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya <br />spies <br />  who want avenge their king's death. </p>
<p>  Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />  mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />  unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.</p>
<p>  Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for sure <br />  that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />  Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?</p>
<p>  I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />  because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years after <br />  Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.</p>
<p>  The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. <br />Karuthiruman <br />  saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />  emory <br />  and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />  Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.</p>
<p>  Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the <br />  Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan <br />fall <br />  in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? </p>
<p>  Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and Madhuranthakan. <br />  Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with Vani, <br />  Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded of <br />  Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />  recognize him?</p>
<p>  The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />  individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />  Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to <br />Kodi <br />  Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />  Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is back. <br />  Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does not <br />  know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />  lighthouse and her last accident. </p>
<p>  Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to her? <br />  was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini resembles <br />  Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an exceptionally <br />  beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we <br />  assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />  because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />  Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />  been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />  rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in mind <br />  other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had <br />  traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special love <br />  or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out <br />  what happened to her.</p>
<p>  Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened to <br />  her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? Karuthiruman <br />  finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in <br />  Chola household but before he could get this information to the <br />king <br />  he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows <br />that <br />  she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or <br />to <br />  their mother.</p>
<p>  Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />  Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of the <br />  Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref: <br />  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1</a>) That is <br />  also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20 ? 22 <br />  years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. <br />  Either way we get the same answer ? Nandini is Veerapandiyan's <br />  daughter.</p>
<p>  The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father of <br />  Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />  suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for <br />the <br />  Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must <br />  vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he <br />  starts with a preamble that ? "Is it Ok if I combine some <br />  imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it is <br />  imagination is difficult for me to concur.</p>
<p>  After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />  Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />  Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini to <br />  Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini and <br />  Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want anybody <br />  to wonder how come they both look alike.</p>
<p>  When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes <br />  place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's <br />  house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from <br />the <br />  Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back <br />at <br />  the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />  Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan <br />was <br />  her father? <br />  What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw Nandini? <br />  I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact that <br />  Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must <br />have <br />  told her so as well.</p>
<p>  But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />  Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in <br />the <br />  presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could she <br />  have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />  Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she <br />had <br />  realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her <br />  brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />  logic!</p>
<p>  Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill him <br />  if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she <br />  needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />  plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man and <br />  that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got into <br />a <br />  mad rage. </p>
<p>  Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. She <br />  had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her <br />  wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan in <br />  his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.</p>
<p>  Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might have <br />  meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even <br />  Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />  where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!</p>
<p>  Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's <br />  daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on Karikalan <br />  the way she did. </p>
<p>  Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else <br />  thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />  unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.</p>
