<p>  "Pisirandaiyar" (1959) is about the Sangam poet who seems to have <br />  been youthful-looking even at an advanced age because of his <br />  balanced view of life and a loving family. The theme leads to the <br />  sterling friendship of the poet with King Kopperunchozhan. <br />Building <br />  a world of imagination on the hints found in the lyrics of <br />  Pisirandaiyar, Bharatidasan presents a tale of love, hate, <br />betrayal, <br />  murder and dark humour as when the child Ponnu speaks about his <br />  mother's death. The aim throughout is to announce aloud the <br />  greatness of Tamil culture. As when we note that the ancient Tamil <br />  artisans could make life-like images in wax. Bharatidasan's <br />  favourite word-play gives pep to the dialogue. </p>
<p>  The rivalry of the Pandya and Chola kingdoms is ignited by the <br />  murder of the Pandyan girl Pachaikili by her husband due to a ruse <br />  engineered by the Chola youth Thooyan. Taking advantage of this <br />  case, the Chola Princes try to wrest power from their father. </p>
<p>  The king seeks to kill his sons, but the poet Pullatrur Eyitranar <br />  calms him down and advises him not to stain the greatness of Tamil <br />  culture by fratricide. The king accepts the admonition and decides <br />  to quit the world by withdrawing from sustenance in the time-<br />tested <br />  tradition of "vadakkiruthal.'' His bosom friend Pisirandaiyar of <br />  Pandyan kingdom hears of this and hurries to his side and so does <br />  another poet, Pothiyar. Both of them join the King in his resolve <br />to <br />  die. </p>
<p>  Death cannot be proud in the face of such incandescent friendship <br />  between the emperors of land and the emperors of poesy. </p>
<p>  Bharatidasan's tribute to the Sangam poet speaks of him as "Paa <br />  Vendhar" since poets were the acknowledged legislators of Moral <br />Law <br />  in ancient Tamil land. Bharatidasan's admirers have given the same <br />  sobriquet to their idol and call him Paa Vendhar Bharatidasan.</p>
<p>  ......another version</p>
<p>  Kopperunchozhan was a chozhar king (c.375-345 B.C.E.) <br />  He was a modest, just, and a poet king who had great poets of his <br />  time as his loyal friends. <br />  Pisir Andhaiyaar was the greatest Tamil poet of that time.He lived <br />  at a village called "Pisir" in the Pandyan Empire, near the city <br />of <br />  Poandhai in pesent Kanyakumari district. <br />  He had been a great fan of Kopperunchozhan without even having <br />seen <br />  him ever.He had considered himself a great fiend of the Chozha <br />king <br />  owing to the latter's vast knowledge in Tamizh, being a good poet <br />  and a great patron of Tamil scholars. <br />  One day, (around 345 B.C.E.)after having a contradiction in <br />  administrative principles with his son the crown prince <br />  Mudiththalaikko perunarkilli, and after the latter having called <br />him <br />  unfit to continue as king, the Chozhar king decided to observe <br />  fasting unto death-the ritual called as "vadakkiruththal"-a way of <br />  ending one's life with esteem, after having finished all his <br />social <br />  duties and in all gratitude for the almighty God Sivaperumanaar. <br />  The problem was that the father did not agree to the prince's wish <br />  to attack the Pandyan king of that time Pandyan Arivudai Nambi, <br />just <br />  to establish the Chozhar supremacy over him.The prince had earlier <br />  been provoked by- the Pandyan Nambi's historic victory over <br />invading <br />  North Indian Emperor, a king of the Nanda dynasty at a huge battle<br />  (c. 345 B.C.E.) near south Kalinga on the banks of the Krishna <br />  River, the then northern border of Thamizhagam and Nambi declared <br />  himself "the Emperor of South India". <br />  Kopperunchozhan didnot agree for an invasion on Madurai because it <br />  was not righteous to wage an unnecessary war for no reason, to <br />kill <br />  innocent soldiers and people when both countries enjoyed peace and <br />  prosperity and were in their respective golden age of fertility <br />and <br />  flourishing wealth.And afterall, the Pandyan Emperor had just done <br />  his duty on behalf of all Tamizh people to prevent the invading <br />  Nanda Emperor from entering South India and one has to pay him <br />with <br />  gratitude for establishing Tamizh supremacy over North Indian <br />  Empire; if not showing enemity towards Nambi Pandyan, <br />  But the crown prince Mudiththalaikko perunarkilli unfortunately <br />  couldnot understand the king's righteousness because of his pumped <br />  up youth and called him unfit to continue as king, <br />  So, When the king sat down for the ritual, his dear friends who <br />  could not bear the separation, and in support for their king's <br />  righteousness also sat along with him to lay down their lives too. <br />  Hearing this news, Pisirandhaiyaar hurried to Uraiyur, in order to <br />  join the ritual to die along with his dearest friend the King. <br />  On meeting the great poet for the first time, the king embraced <br />  Pisirandhaiyaar, with tears in his eyes, still unable to believe <br />  this extraordinary true and loyal heart-melting friend willing to <br />  accompany him through the path of death to the land of golden <br />  garden - the Heaven. <br />  Then both the king and his beloved friend Pisirandhaiyaar and <br />other <br />  poets sat on the South banks of River Ponni fasting unto death and <br />  reached the high Heavens together.</p>

<p>Mail from C.Venkatesh,<br />Producer-CV'S Theatre group</p>
<p>Dear Mr.S.balasubramani<br /><a href="mailto:kalinga_tamil@yahoo.co.in">kalinga_tamil@yahoo.co.in</a></p>
<p>I heartfully extend my thanks for the support &amp; co-ordination you <br />had extended for the Play "Sanga Illakiyathil Natpu" (Friendship in <br />Ancient Tamil Literature) and making it a grand success.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell some more facts related to the theme we selected <br />for the drama viz., Friendship between King Adhiyamaan &amp; Poet <br />Avvaiyar. King Adhiyamaan was ruling Thagadur (Presently Dharmapuri <br />District). The district got its name from the work dharmam which <br />means gifting. Since Adhiyamaan had gifted the precious Amla he got <br />to Avaiyar, the district came to be known as Dharmapuri.</p>
<p>Once again I thank you for your efforts and wish you all success for <br />your kalinga_tamil.</p>

<p>Tips for your mobile<br />from Swaminathan of Tamils in Noida<br />If you are already aware of these tips, pls ignore this mail <br />otherwise<br />try these out</p>
<p>3 very useful Mobile Phone tips</p>
<p>1) Emergency number</p>
<p>The Emergency Number worldwide for Mobile is 112.</p>
<p>If you find yourself out of coverage area of your mobile network and<br />there is an emergency, dial 112 and the mobile will search any <br />existing<br />network to establish the emergency number for you, and interestingly<br />this number112 can be dialed even while the keypad is locked.<br />Try it out.</p>
<p>2) Locked the keys in the car? Your car has remote keys?</p>
<p>This may come in handy someday. Good reason to own a cell phone:<br />If u happen to lock your keys in the car and the spare keys at home,<br />call someone on your cell phone. Hold your cell phone about a foot <br />from<br />your car door and have theother person at your home press the unlock<br />button, holding it near thephone on their end. Your car will unlock.</p>
<p>Saves someone from having to drive your keys to you. Distance is no<br />object. You could be hundreds of miles away, and if you can reach<br />someone who has the other "remote" for your car, you can unlock the<br />doors (or the trunk).</p>
<p>Editor's Note: *It works fine! We tried it out and it unlocked our <br />car<br />over a cell phone!"</p>
<p>3) HiddenBattery power</p>
<p>Imagine your cell battery is very low, u r expecting an important <br />call<br />and u don't have a charger. Nokia instrument comes with a reserve<br />battery.<br />To activate,<br />press the keys *3370# Your cell will restart with this reserve and <br />the<br />instrument will show a 50% increase in battery. This reserve will get<br />charged when u charge your cell next time.</p>

<p>    "Pisirandaiyar" (1959) is about the Sangam poet who seems to <br />have <br />    been youthful-looking even at an advanced age because of his <br />    balanced view of life and a loving family. The theme leads to <br />the <br />    sterling friendship of the poet with King Kopperunchozhan. <br />  Building <br />    a world of imagination on the hints found in the lyrics of <br />    Pisirandaiyar, Bharatidasan presents a tale of love, hate, <br />  betrayal, <br />    murder and dark humour as when the child Ponnu speaks about his <br />    mother's death. The aim throughout is to announce aloud the <br />    greatness of Tamil culture. As when we note that the ancient <br />Tamil <br />    artisans could make life-like images in wax. Bharatidasan's <br />    favourite word-play gives pep to the dialogue. </p>
<p>    The rivalry of the Pandya and Chola kingdoms is ignited by the <br />    murder of the Pandyan girl Pachaikili by her husband due to a <br />ruse <br />    engineered by the Chola youth Thooyan. Taking advantage of this <br />    case, the Chola Princes try to wrest power from their father. </p>
<p>    The king seeks to kill his sons, but the poet Pullatrur <br />Eyitranar <br />    calms him down and advises him not to stain the greatness of <br />Tamil <br />    culture by fratricide. The king accepts the admonition and <br />decides <br />    to quit the world by withdrawing from sustenance in the time-<br />  tested <br />    tradition of "vadakkiruthal.'' His bosom friend Pisirandaiyar of <br />    Pandyan kingdom hears of this and hurries to his side and so <br />does <br />    another poet, Pothiyar. Both of them join the King in his <br />resolve <br />  to <br />    die. </p>
<p>    Death cannot be proud in the face of such incandescent <br />friendship <br />    between the emperors of land and the emperors of poesy. </p>
<p>    Bharatidasan's tribute to the Sangam poet speaks of him as "Paa <br />    Vendhar" since poets were the acknowledged legislators of Moral <br />  Law <br />    in ancient Tamil land. Bharatidasan's admirers have given the <br />same <br />    sobriquet to their idol and call him Paa Vendhar Bharatidasan.</p>
<p>    ......another version</p>
<p>    Kopperunchozhan was a chozhar king (c.375-345 B.C.E.) <br />    He was a modest, just, and a poet king who had great poets of <br />his <br />    time as his loyal friends. <br />    Pisir Andhaiyaar was the greatest Tamil poet of that time.He <br />lived <br />    at a village called "Pisir" in the Pandyan Empire, near the city <br />  of <br />    Poandhai in pesent Kanyakumari district. <br />    He had been a great fan of Kopperunchozhan without even having <br />  seen <br />    him ever.He had considered himself a great fiend of the Chozha <br />  king <br />    owing to the latter's vast knowledge in Tamizh, being a good <br />poet <br />    and a great patron of Tamil scholars. <br />    One day, (around 345 B.C.E.)after having a contradiction in <br />    administrative principles with his son the crown prince <br />    Mudiththalaikko perunarkilli, and after the latter having called <br />  him <br />    unfit to continue as king, the Chozhar king decided to observe <br />    fasting unto death-the ritual called as "vadakkiruththal"-a way <br />of <br />    ending one's life with esteem, after having finished all his <br />  social <br />    duties and in all gratitude for the almighty God Sivaperumanaar. <br />    The problem was that the father did not agree to the prince's <br />wish <br />    to attack the Pandyan king of that time Pandyan Arivudai Nambi, <br />  just <br />    to establish the Chozhar supremacy over him.The prince had <br />earlier <br />    been provoked by- the Pandyan Nambi's historic victory over <br />  invading <br />    North Indian Emperor, a king of the Nanda dynasty at a huge <br />battle<br />    (c. 345 B.C.E.) near south Kalinga on the banks of the Krishna <br />    River, the then northern border of Thamizhagam and Nambi <br />declared <br />    himself "the Emperor of South India". <br />    Kopperunchozhan didnot agree for an invasion on Madurai because <br />it <br />    was not righteous to wage an unnecessary war for no reason, to <br />  kill <br />    innocent soldiers and people when both countries enjoyed peace <br />and <br />    prosperity and were in their respective golden age of fertility <br />  and <br />    flourishing wealth.And afterall, the Pandyan Emperor had just <br />done <br />    his duty on behalf of all Tamizh people to prevent the invading <br />    Nanda Emperor from entering South India and one has to pay him <br />  with <br />    gratitude for establishing Tamizh supremacy over North Indian <br />    Empire; if not showing enemity towards Nambi Pandyan, <br />    But the crown prince Mudiththalaikko perunarkilli unfortunately <br />    couldnot understand the king's righteousness because of his <br />pumped <br />    up youth and called him unfit to continue as king, <br />    So, When the king sat down for the ritual, his dear friends who <br />    could not bear the separation, and in support for their king's <br />    righteousness also sat along with him to lay down their lives <br />too. <br />    Hearing this news, Pisirandhaiyaar hurried to Uraiyur, in order <br />to <br />    join the ritual to die along with his dearest friend the King. <br />    On meeting the great poet for the first time, the king embraced <br />    Pisirandhaiyaar, with tears in his eyes, still unable to believe <br />    this extraordinary true and loyal heart-melting friend willing <br />to <br />    accompany him through the path of death to the land of golden <br />    garden - the Heaven. <br />    Then both the king and his beloved friend Pisirandhaiyaar and <br />  other <br />    poets sat on the South banks of River Ponni fasting unto death <br />and <br />    reached the high Heavens together.</p>

<p>  Kopperunchozhan was a chozhar king (c.375-345 B.C.E.) <br />  He was a modest, just, and a poet king who had great poets of his <br />  time as his loyal friends. <br />  Pisir Andhaiyaar was the greatest Tamil poet of that time.He lived <br />  at a village called "Pisir" in the Pandyan Empire, near the city <br />of <br />  Poandhai in pesent Kanyakumari district. <br />  He had been a great fan of Kopperunchozhan without even having <br />seen <br />  him ever.He had considered himself a great fiend of the Chozha <br />king <br />  owing to the latter's vast knowledge in Tamizh, being a good poet <br />  and a great patron of Tamil scholars. <br />  One day, (around 345 B.C.E.)after having a contradiction in <br />  administrative principles with his son the crown prince <br />  Mudiththalaikko perunarkilli, and after the latter having called <br />him <br />  unfit to continue as king, the Chozhar king decided to observe <br />  fasting unto death-the ritual called as "vadakkiruththal"-a way of <br />  ending one's life with esteem, after having finished all his <br />social <br />  duties and in all gratitude for the almighty God Sivaperumanaar. <br />  The problem was that the father did not agree to the prince's wish <br />  to attack the Pandyan king of that time Pandyan Arivudai Nambi, <br />just <br />  to establish the Chozhar supremacy over him.The prince had earlier <br />  been provoked by- the Pandyan Nambi's historic victory over <br />invading <br />  North Indian Emperor, a king of the Nanda dynasty at a huge battle<br />  (c. 345 B.C.E.) near south Kalinga on the banks of the Krishna <br />  River, the then northern border of Thamizhagam and Nambi declared <br />  himself "the Emperor of South India". <br />  Kopperunchozhan didnot agree for an invasion on Madurai because it <br />  was not righteous to wage an unnecessary war for no reason, to <br />kill <br />  innocent soldiers and people when both countries enjoyed peace and <br />  prosperity and were in their respective golden age of fertility <br />and <br />  flourishing wealth.And afterall, the Pandyan Emperor had just done <br />  his duty on behalf of all Tamizh people to prevent the invading <br />  Nanda Emperor from entering South India and one has to pay him <br />with <br />  gratitude for establishing Tamizh supremacy over North Indian <br />  Empire; if not showing enemity towards Nambi Pandyan, <br />  But the crown prince Mudiththalaikko perunarkilli unfortunately <br />  couldnot understand the king's righteousness because of his pumped <br />  up youth and called him unfit to continue as king, <br />  So, When the king sat down for the ritual, his dear friends who <br />  could not bear the separation, and in support for their king's <br />  righteousness also sat along with him to lay down their lives too. <br />  Hearing this news, Pisirandhaiyaar hurried to Uraiyur, in order to <br />  join the ritual to die along with his dearest friend the King. <br />  On meeting the great poet for the first time, the king embraced <br />  Pisirandhaiyaar, with tears in his eyes, still unable to believe <br />  this extraordinary true and loyal heart-melting friend willing to <br />  accompany him through the path of death to the land of golden <br />  garden - the Heaven. <br />  Then both the king and his beloved friend Pisirandhaiyaar and <br />other <br />  poets sat on the South banks of River Ponni fasting unto death and <br />  reached the high Heavens together.</p>
