</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Rahul,</p>
<p>U are absolutely right.. Thanks for bringing this up..</p>
<p>In Malayalam &amp; Telugu (not much familiar with Kannada friends), they<br />Head of the Family maintains the FAMILY NAME and each house used to<br />display this name. We find that in their Pass port / Wedding<br />invitations etc.</p>
<p>For some reasons, this practice is dispensed with .. as could be seen<br />from Sangam period names.</p>
<p>When I read KANE AND ABEL novel about a decade back, I put two things<br />in practice.</p>
<p>Presented a Diary to my daughter and son. To record every important<br />event / trips etc. To make a Year book, their birth day party, school<br />picnic photos, friends etc.</p>
<p>Other thing is : </p>
<p>Assume one has about Rs. 100000 ear-marked to put in Stock market /<br />buy Gold / siver .. kind of investment plan.</p>
<p>Record the investments like purchase - sale of shares / precious<br />metals, profit / loss for about a month and see by the end of the<br />month whether this 100000 has improved or not.</p>
<p>Now with NDTV Profit, CNN Business etc., things are much better..</p>
<p>Nevertheless, habit of recording events is very important and will be<br />very much over a period of time...</p>
<p>Nagarathars have better systems too.</p>

<blockquote><p>  hi;   looking at the lighter side of things its really quite funny that<br />the king<br />  who the time to build some of the biggest structures in the ancient<br />world,<br />  conquer far away lands dint have time to just sit down and write<br />about all<br />  this. All he had to do was spend a month or so during his final years in<br />  writing or sculpting his life. I find this very very wierd.<br />  He dint even have to do it himself he could have got somebody to do it.<br />  Looks like even RRC did not know how great he was and how the future<br />  generations would admire him.</p>
<p>  The same mistakes are being made even today. Lets compare the ancient<br />  empires to the business empires of today. Almost every European or<br />American<br />  businessman or CEO (the really famous ones and the not so famous<br />ones) take<br />  time out to write books about how they got there, thier life, etc. Jack<br />  Welch, Gates, Ricardo Semler, Sam Walton, etc. This way people learn<br />about<br />  thier exploits, mistakes, etc.</p>
<p>  Can you name one Indian businessman who has written a book of his<br />exploits?<br />  Recently Kokila Ben launched a photograph collection of Dhirubhai<br />Ambani's<br />  life but nothing else. Even the incredible Mr. Narayana Murthy has<br />written<br />  very little about his life. Maybe im not aware of a few biogrpahies on<br />  Indian businessmen but the truth is the cupboard is bare when we<br />cmpare with<br />  the Eurpeans and Americans. Thank god Dr.Kalam took time out for<br />recording<br />  this. Even in Indian cricket Sunil Gavaskar has a biography and<br />maybe a few<br />  other cricketers but absolutely nothing from some of the most incredible<br />  talents like GRV (i cant remember reading even an interview from this<br />  artist), Chandra, etc. Looks like we haven't learnt anything from<br />our past.</p>

<p>      Listing the challenges in a pesimistic way, is it not<br />      Madan's way?</p>
<p>    Hi Natajan,<br />    if you stir up your memories you will know this topic did not arise<br />    after madans answer.<br />    we spoke about this earlier. you and me.<br />    in kanchi hotel chingelpet when we had all gone on that trip last<br />    year during the lunch we had the same argument .<br />    i almost remember the words. the discussion was what do we really<br />    know about RRC.his birth? his death? and the time in between.</p>
<p>    well, what do we think are RRcs greatest achievements?<br />    i as a staunch shaivaite woul rate finding of the thirumurais in<br />    chidambaram as no 1.<br />    an architecture lover would rate building the big temple.<br />    a ponniyin selvan fan would rate his sacrifice of the throne to<br />    uthama as his greatest achievement. pinnacle of sacrifice is how the<br />    translated version of PS calls it.</p>
<p>    we all however agree that these three are the greatest achievements<br />    possible in one man's lifetime.</p>
<p>    yet they too are clouded in doubt and contreversy.<br />    BIG TEMPLE why should the upper chambers be incomplete( RRC was a<br />    perfectionist- rememeber). why was this temple and tanjore almost<br />    abandoned soon after RRC's death.<br />    THIRUMURAI- there are so many theories as to the finding of<br />    thirumurais. now historians claim the event itself is a legend or<br />    that rrc was not involved.<br />    SACRIFICE FOR UTHAMA- there are kalvettu evidences in thirukoviloor<br />    suggesting that RRC could have been a baby when his dad died. this<br />    could perhaps explain a lot of things on what he was doing during<br />    uthama's reign.he was propably a kid.</p>
<p>    its not that we dont have a history. we have a great one. but then<br />    the lacuna in explaining them hurts.<br />    you are a historical fiction writer too. how easy do you think<br />    gathering info is?<br />    regards<br />    venketesh</p>
<p>        later cholas. the gap is 500 years.<br />        its not the medium that counts, its the sponsor.<br />        whether its copper plates, or olai suvadi or<br />        kalvettu the man who<br />        sponsors the writing gets a lions share of the<br />        publicity.<br />        kamban himself compared major charecters in his<br />        ramayana to sadayappa<br />        vallal who sponsered his daily expenses.</p>
<p>        recently i attended a book release function.<br />        Vaali's poems on karunanithi. 5 poets recited their<br />        poems on the cm.<br />        pa vijay, palani barathi and vaali included. for<br />        somebody new to have<br />        beleived the 5 poets would have made them feel the<br />        tamil world is<br />        surviving only because of his endevour.<br />        I thought in this modern age this sychophancy works.<br />        how it must have<br />        been in those days.</p>

<p>        Dear Rahul,</p>
<p>        U are absolutely right.. Thanks for bringing this up..</p>
<p>        In Malayalam &amp; Telugu (not much familiar with Kannada <br />  friends), <br />      they<br />        Head of the Family maintains the FAMILY NAME and each house <br />  used to<br />        display this name. We find that in their Pass port / Wedding<br />        invitations etc.</p>
<p>        For some reasons, this practice is dispensed with .. as could <br />  be <br />      seen<br />        from Sangam period names.</p>
<p>        When I read KANE AND ABEL novel about a decade back, I put two <br />      things<br />        in practice.</p>
<p>        Presented a Diary to my daughter and son. To record every <br />  important<br />        event / trips etc. To make a Year book, their birth day party, <br />      school<br />        picnic photos, friends etc.</p>
<p>        Other thing is : </p>
<p>        Assume one has about Rs. 100000 ear-marked to put in Stock <br />  market /<br />        buy Gold / siver .. kind of investment plan.</p>
<p>        Record the investments like purchase - sale of shares / precious<br />        metals, profit / loss for about a month and see by the end of <br />  the<br />        month whether this 100000 has improved or not.</p>
<p>        Now with NDTV Profit, CNN Business etc., things are much <br />  better..</p>

<p>          hi;           looking at the lighter side of things its really quite funny <br />  that<br />        the king<br />          who the time to build some of the biggest structures in the <br />      ancient<br />        world,<br />          conquer far away lands dint have time to just sit down and <br />  write<br />        about all<br />          this. All he had to do was spend a month or so during his <br />  final <br />      years in<br />          writing or sculpting his life. I find this very very wierd.<br />          He dint even have to do it himself he could have got somebody <br />  to <br />      do it.<br />          Looks like even RRC did not know how great he was and how the <br />      future<br />          generations would admire him.</p>
<p>          The same mistakes are being made even today. Lets compare the <br />      ancient<br />          empires to the business empires of today. Almost every <br />  European or<br />        American<br />          businessman or CEO (the really famous ones and the not so <br />  famous<br />        ones) take<br />          time out to write books about how they got there, thier life, <br />      etc. Jack<br />          Welch, Gates, Ricardo Semler, Sam Walton, etc. This way <br />  people <br />      learn<br />        about<br />          thier exploits, mistakes, etc.</p>
<p>          Can you name one Indian businessman who has written a book of <br />  his<br />        exploits?<br />          Recently Kokila Ben launched a photograph collection of <br />  Dhirubhai<br />        Ambani's<br />          life but nothing else. Even the incredible Mr. Narayana <br />  Murthy has<br />        written<br />          very little about his life. Maybe im not aware of a few <br />      biogrpahies on<br />          Indian businessmen but the truth is the cupboard is bare when <br />  we<br />        cmpare with<br />          the Eurpeans and Americans. Thank god Dr.Kalam took time out <br />  for<br />        recording<br />          this. Even in Indian cricket Sunil Gavaskar has a biography <br />  and<br />        maybe a few<br />          other cricketers but absolutely nothing from some of the most <br />      incredible<br />          talents like GRV (i cant remember reading even an interview <br />  from <br />      this<br />          artist), Chandra, etc. Looks like we haven't learnt anything <br />  from<br />        our past.</p>

<p>              Listing the challenges in a pesimistic way, is it not<br />              Madan's way?</p>
<p>            Hi Natajan,<br />            if you stir up your memories you will know this topic did <br />  not <br />      arise<br />            after madans answer.<br />            we spoke about this earlier. you and me.<br />            in kanchi hotel chingelpet when we had all gone on that <br />  trip <br />      last<br />            year during the lunch we had the same argument .<br />            i almost remember the words. the discussion was what do we <br />      really<br />            know about RRC.his birth? his death? and the time in <br />  between.</p>
<p>            well, what do we think are RRcs greatest achievements?<br />            i as a staunch shaivaite woul rate finding of the <br />  thirumurais in<br />            chidambaram as no 1.<br />            an architecture lover would rate building the big temple.<br />            a ponniyin selvan fan would rate his sacrifice of the <br />  throne to<br />            uthama as his greatest achievement. pinnacle of sacrifice <br />  is <br />      how the<br />            translated version of PS calls it.</p>
<p>            we all however agree that these three are the greatest <br />      achievements<br />            possible in one man's lifetime.</p>
<p>            yet they too are clouded in doubt and contreversy.<br />            BIG TEMPLE why should the upper chambers be incomplete( RRC <br />  was <br />      a<br />            perfectionist- rememeber). why was this temple and tanjore <br />      almost<br />            abandoned soon after RRC's death.<br />            THIRUMURAI- there are so many theories as to the finding of<br />            thirumurais. now historians claim the event itself is a <br />  legend <br />      or<br />            that rrc was not involved.<br />            SACRIFICE FOR UTHAMA- there are kalvettu evidences in <br />      thirukoviloor<br />            suggesting that RRC could have been a baby when his dad <br />  died. <br />      this<br />            could perhaps explain a lot of things on what he was doing <br />      during<br />            uthama's reign.he was propably a kid.</p>
<p>            its not that we dont have a history. we have a great one. <br />  but <br />      then<br />            the lacuna in explaining them hurts.<br />            you are a historical fiction writer too. how easy do you <br />  think<br />            gathering info is?<br />            regards<br />            venketesh</p>
<p>                later cholas. the gap is 500 years.<br />                its not the medium that counts, its the sponsor.<br />                whether its copper plates, or olai suvadi or<br />                kalvettu the man who<br />                sponsors the writing gets a lions share of the<br />                publicity.<br />                kamban himself compared major charecters in his<br />                ramayana to sadayappa<br />                vallal who sponsered his daily expenses.</p>
<p>                recently i attended a book release function.<br />                Vaali's poems on karunanithi. 5 poets recited their<br />                poems on the cm.<br />                pa vijay, palani barathi and vaali included. for<br />                somebody new to have<br />                beleived the 5 poets would have made them feel the<br />                tamil world is<br />                surviving only because of his endevour.<br />                I thought in this modern age this sychophancy works.<br />                how it must have<br />                been in those days.</p>

I find this<br />  very very wierd.<br />          He dint even have to do it himself he could<br />  have got somebody <br />  to <br />      do it.<br />          Looks like even RRC did not know how great<br />  he was and how the <br />      future<br />          generations would admire him.</p>
<p>          The same mistakes are being made even today.<br />  Lets compare the <br />      ancient<br />          empires to the business empires of today.<br />  Almost every <br />  European or<br />        American<br />          businessman or CEO (the really famous ones<br />  and the not so <br />  famous<br />        ones) take<br />          time out to write books about how they got<br />  there, thier life, <br />      etc. Jack<br />          Welch, Gates, Ricardo Semler, Sam Walton,<br />  etc. This way <br />  people </p>

<p>      Dear Rahul,</p>
<p>      U are absolutely right.. Thanks for bringing this up..</p>
<p>      In Malayalam &amp; Telugu (not much familiar with Kannada <br />friends), <br />    they<br />      Head of the Family maintains the FAMILY NAME and each house <br />used to<br />      display this name. We find that in their Pass port / Wedding<br />      invitations etc.</p>
<p>      For some reasons, this practice is dispensed with .. as could <br />be <br />    seen<br />      from Sangam period names.</p>
<p>      When I read KANE AND ABEL novel about a decade back, I put two <br />    things<br />      in practice.</p>
<p>      Presented a Diary to my daughter and son. To record every <br />important<br />      event / trips etc. To make a Year book, their birth day party, <br />    school<br />      picnic photos, friends etc.</p>
<p>      Other thing is : </p>
<p>      Assume one has about Rs. 100000 ear-marked to put in Stock <br />market /<br />      buy Gold / siver .. kind of investment plan.</p>
<p>      Record the investments like purchase - sale of shares / precious<br />      metals, profit / loss for about a month and see by the end of <br />the<br />      month whether this 100000 has improved or not.</p>
<p>      Now with NDTV Profit, CNN Business etc., things are much <br />better..</p>
<p>      Nevertheless, habit of recording events is very important and <br />will <br />    be<br />      very much over a period of time...</p>
<p>      Nagarathars have better systems too.</p>

<p>        The same mistakes are being made even today. Lets compare the <br />    ancient<br />        empires to the business empires of today. Almost every <br />European or<br />      American<br />        businessman or CEO (the really famous ones and the not so <br />famous<br />      ones) take<br />        time out to write books about how they got there, thier life, <br />    etc. Jack<br />        Welch, Gates, Ricardo Semler, Sam Walton, etc. This way <br />people <br />    learn<br />      about<br />        thier exploits, mistakes, etc.</p>
<p>        Can you name one Indian businessman who has written a book of <br />his<br />      exploits?<br />        Recently Kokila Ben launched a photograph collection of <br />Dhirubhai<br />      Ambani's<br />        life but nothing else. Even the incredible Mr. Narayana <br />Murthy has<br />      written<br />        very little about his life. Maybe im not aware of a few <br />    biogrpahies on<br />        Indian businessmen but the truth is the cupboard is bare when <br />we<br />      cmpare with<br />        the Eurpeans and Americans. Thank god Dr.Kalam took time out <br />for<br />      recording<br />        this. Even in Indian cricket Sunil Gavaskar has a biography <br />and<br />      maybe a few<br />        other cricketers but absolutely nothing from some of the most <br />    incredible<br />        talents like GRV (i cant remember reading even an interview <br />from <br />    this<br />        artist), Chandra, etc. Looks like we haven't learnt anything <br />from<br />      our past.</p>

<p>            Listing the challenges in a pesimistic way, is it not<br />            Madan's way?</p>
<p>          Hi Natajan,<br />          if you stir up your memories you will know this topic did <br />not <br />    arise<br />          after madans answer.<br />          we spoke about this earlier. you and me.<br />          in kanchi hotel chingelpet when we had all gone on that <br />trip <br />    last<br />          year during the lunch we had the same argument .<br />          i almost remember the words. the discussion was what do we <br />    really<br />          know about RRC.his birth? his death? and the time in <br />between.</p>
<p>          well, what do we think are RRcs greatest achievements?<br />          i as a staunch shaivaite woul rate finding of the <br />thirumurais in<br />          chidambaram as no 1.<br />          an architecture lover would rate building the big temple.<br />          a ponniyin selvan fan would rate his sacrifice of the <br />throne to<br />          uthama as his greatest achievement. pinnacle of sacrifice <br />is <br />    how the<br />          translated version of PS calls it.</p>
<p>          we all however agree that these three are the greatest <br />    achievements<br />          possible in one man's lifetime.</p>
<p>          yet they too are clouded in doubt and contreversy.<br />          BIG TEMPLE why should the upper chambers be incomplete( RRC <br />was <br />    a<br />          perfectionist- rememeber). why was this temple and tanjore <br />    almost<br />          abandoned soon after RRC's death.<br />          THIRUMURAI- there are so many theories as to the finding of<br />          thirumurais. now historians claim the event itself is a <br />legend <br />    or<br />          that rrc was not involved.<br />          SACRIFICE FOR UTHAMA- there are kalvettu evidences in <br />    thirukoviloor<br />          suggesting that RRC could have been a baby when his dad <br />died. <br />    this<br />          could perhaps explain a lot of things on what he was doing <br />    during<br />          uthama's reign.he was propably a kid.</p>
<p>          its not that we dont have a history. we have a great one. <br />but <br />    then<br />          the lacuna in explaining them hurts.<br />          you are a historical fiction writer too. how easy do you <br />think<br />          gathering info is?<br />          regards<br />          venketesh</p>
<p>              later cholas. the gap is 500 years.<br />              its not the medium that counts, its the sponsor.<br />              whether its copper plates, or olai suvadi or<br />              kalvettu the man who<br />              sponsors the writing gets a lions share of the<br />              publicity.<br />              kamban himself compared major charecters in his<br />              ramayana to sadayappa<br />              vallal who sponsered his daily expenses.</p>
<p>              recently i attended a book release function.<br />              Vaali's poems on karunanithi. 5 poets recited their<br />              poems on the cm.<br />              pa vijay, palani barathi and vaali included. for<br />              somebody new to have<br />              beleived the 5 poets would have made them feel the<br />              tamil world is<br />              surviving only because of his endevour.<br />              I thought in this modern age this sychophancy works.<br />              how it must have<br />              been in those days.</p>

<p>  Particularly Mylapore Santhome High road was supposed to have been<br />  very famous for meet of guys of foreign origin :</p>
<p>  The French used to visit from Pondy and neary area;   The Protugese from Santhome; and <br />  The British from George Town.</p>
<p>  Tho" the Dutch, originally landed at Tranqubar @ Tharangampadi, left<br />  India prior to the arrival other Traders from the Eurpeon community,<br />  some of them remained in Tamilnadu.</p>
<p>  They also visited Santhome.</p>
<p>  Appears the place looked like any Street in Clint Eastwood movies !</p>
<p>  Anandarangam Pillai dealt in detail the relationship of Nawab of <br />Arcot<br />  with the Eurpeons, French and B ritish in particular !</p>

<p>      Other thing is : </p>
<p>      Assume one has about Rs. 100000 ear-marked to put in Stock <br />market /<br />      buy Gold / siver .. kind of investment plan.</p>
<p>      Record the investments like purchase - sale of shares / precious<br />      metals, profit / loss for about a month and see by the end of <br />the<br />      month whether this 100000 has improved or not.</p>
<p>      Now with NDTV Profit, CNN Business etc., things are much <br />better..</p>
<p>      Nevertheless, habit of recording events is very important and <br />will <br />    be<br />      very much over a period of time...</p>
<p>      Nagarathars have better systems too.</p>

<p>        hi;         looking at the lighter side of things its really quite funny <br />that<br />      the king<br />        who the time to build some of the biggest structures in the <br />    ancient<br />      world,<br />        conquer far away lands dint have time to just sit down and <br />write<br />      about all<br />        this. All he had to do was spend a month or so during his <br />final <br />    years in<br />        writing or sculpting his life. I find this very very wierd.<br />        He dint even have to do it himself he could have got somebody <br />to <br />    do it.<br />        Looks like even RRC did not know how great he was and how the <br />    future<br />        generations would admire him.</p>
<p>        The same mistakes are being made even today. Lets compare the <br />    ancient<br />        empires to the business empires of today. Almost every <br />European or<br />      American<br />        businessman or CEO (the really famous ones and the not so <br />famous<br />      ones) take<br />        time out to write books about how they got there, thier life, <br />    etc. Jack<br />        Welch, Gates, Ricardo Semler, Sam Walton, etc. This way <br />people <br />    learn<br />      about<br />        thier exploits, mistakes, etc.</p>
<p>        Can you name one Indian businessman who has written a book of <br />his<br />      exploits?<br />        Recently Kokila Ben launched a photograph collection of <br />Dhirubhai<br />      Ambani's<br />        life but nothing else. Even the incredible Mr. Narayana <br />Murthy has<br />      written<br />        very little about his life. Maybe im not aware of a few <br />    biogrpahies on<br />        Indian businessmen but the truth is the cupboard is bare when <br />we<br />      cmpare with<br />        the Eurpeans and Americans. Thank god Dr.Kalam took time out <br />for<br />      recording<br />        this. Even in Indian cricket Sunil Gavaskar has a biography <br />and<br />      maybe a few<br />        other cricketers but absolutely nothing from some of the most <br />    incredible<br />        talents like GRV (i cant remember reading even an interview <br />from <br />    this<br />        artist), Chandra, etc. Looks like we haven't learnt anything <br />from<br />      our past.</p>

<p>          Hi Natajan,<br />          if you stir up your memories you will know this topic did <br />not <br />    arise<br />          after madans answer.<br />          we spoke about this earlier. you and me.<br />          in kanchi hotel chingelpet when we had all gone on that <br />trip <br />    last<br />          year during the lunch we had the same argument .<br />          i almost remember the words. the discussion was what do we <br />    really<br />          know about RRC.his birth? his death? and the time in <br />between.</p>
<p>          well, what do we think are RRcs greatest achievements?<br />          i as a staunch shaivaite woul rate finding of the <br />thirumurais in<br />          chidambaram as no 1.<br />          an architecture lover would rate building the big temple.<br />          a ponniyin selvan fan would rate his sacrifice of the <br />throne to<br />          uthama as his greatest achievement. pinnacle of sacrifice <br />is <br />    how the<br />          translated version of PS calls it.</p>
<p>          we all however agree that these three are the greatest <br />    achievements<br />          possible in one man's lifetime.</p>
<p>          yet they too are clouded in doubt and contreversy.<br />          BIG TEMPLE why should the upper chambers be incomplete( RRC <br />was <br />    a<br />          perfectionist- rememeber). why was this temple and tanjore <br />    almost<br />          abandoned soon after RRC's death.<br />          THIRUMURAI- there are so many theories as to the finding of<br />          thirumurais. now historians claim the event itself is a <br />legend <br />    or<br />          that rrc was not involved.<br />          SACRIFICE FOR UTHAMA- there are kalvettu evidences in <br />    thirukoviloor<br />          suggesting that RRC could have been a baby when his dad <br />died. <br />    this<br />          could perhaps explain a lot of things on what he was doing <br />    during<br />          uthama's reign.he was propably a kid.</p>
<p>          its not that we dont have a history. we have a great one. <br />but <br />    then<br />          the lacuna in explaining them hurts.<br />          you are a historical fiction writer too. how easy do you <br />think<br />          gathering info is?<br />          regards<br />          venketesh</p>
<p>              later cholas. the gap is 500 years.<br />              its not the medium that counts, its the sponsor.<br />              whether its copper plates, or olai suvadi or<br />              kalvettu the man who<br />              sponsors the writing gets a lions share of the<br />              publicity.<br />              kamban himself compared major charecters in his<br />              ramayana to sadayappa<br />              vallal who sponsered his daily expenses.</p>
<p>              recently i attended a book release function.<br />              Vaali's poems on karunanithi. 5 poets recited their<br />              poems on the cm.<br />              pa vijay, palani barathi and vaali included. for<br />              somebody new to have<br />              beleived the 5 poets would have made them feel the<br />              tamil world is<br />              surviving only because of his endevour.<br />              I thought in this modern age this sychophancy works.<br />              how it must have<br />              been in those days.</p>

<p>INDIAN BANK FORMER CHAIRMAN SHRI. M.GOPALAKRISHNAN hails from the<br />family of Anandarangam pillai.</p>
<p>Remember to have read very interesting episodes. </p>
<p>Particularly Mylapore Santhome High road was supposed to have been<br />very famous for meet of guys of foreign origin :</p>
<p>The French used to visit from Pondy and neary area; The Protugese from Santhome; and <br />The British from George Town.</p>
<p>Tho" the Dutch, originally landed at Tranqubar @ Tharangampadi, left<br />India prior to the arrival other Traders from the Eurpeon community,<br />some of them remained in Tamilnadu.</p>
<p>They also visited Santhome.</p>
<p>Appears the place looked like any Street in Clint Eastwood movies !</p>
<p>Anandarangam Pillai dealt in detail the relationship of Nawab of Arcot<br />with the Eurpeons, French and B ritish in particular !</p>
<p>Very interesting... Read long time back..</p>
<p>sps<br />============</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hi<br />  co incidental.but I am reading Ananda ranga pillai's diary right now.</p>
<p>  a courtier of Dupleix he has maintained a diary for aquarter century <br />  from 1736-1760</p>
<p>  he is described as perhaps the most acuteindian observer of <br />  contemprory events.</p>
<p>  history of french in india their life styles and habits wars and <br />  defeats all can be gathered from his diaries.</p>

<p>    Dear Rahul,</p>
<p>    U are absolutely right.. Thanks for bringing this up..</p>
<p>    In Malayalam &amp; Telugu (not much familiar with Kannada friends), <br />  they<br />    Head of the Family maintains the FAMILY NAME and each house used to<br />    display this name. We find that in their Pass port / Wedding<br />    invitations etc.</p>
<p>    For some reasons, this practice is dispensed with .. as could be <br />  seen<br />    from Sangam period names.</p>
<p>    When I read KANE AND ABEL novel about a decade back, I put two <br />  things<br />    in practice.</p>
<p>    Presented a Diary to my daughter and son. To record every important<br />    event / trips etc. To make a Year book, their birth day party, <br />  school<br />    picnic photos, friends etc.</p>

<p>    Dear Rahul,</p>
<p>    U are absolutely right.. Thanks for bringing this up..</p>
<p>    In Malayalam &amp; Telugu (not much familiar with Kannada friends), <br />  they<br />    Head of the Family maintains the FAMILY NAME and each house used to<br />    display this name. We find that in their Pass port / Wedding<br />    invitations etc.</p>
<p>    For some reasons, this practice is dispensed with .. as could be <br />  seen<br />    from Sangam period names.</p>
<p>    When I read KANE AND ABEL novel about a decade back, I put two <br />  things<br />    in practice.</p>
<p>    Presented a Diary to my daughter and son. To record every important<br />    event / trips etc. To make a Year book, their birth day party, <br />  school<br />    picnic photos, friends etc.</p>
<p>    Other thing is : </p>
<p>    Assume one has about Rs. 100000 ear-marked to put in Stock market /<br />    buy Gold / siver .. kind of investment plan.</p>
<p>    Record the investments like purchase - sale of shares / precious<br />    metals, profit / loss for about a month and see by the end of the<br />    month whether this 100000 has improved or not.</p>
<p>    Now with NDTV Profit, CNN Business etc., things are much better..</p>
<p>    Nevertheless, habit of recording events is very important and will <br />  be<br />    very much over a period of time...</p>
<p>    Nagarathars have better systems too.</p>

<p>      The same mistakes are being made even today. Lets compare the <br />  ancient<br />      empires to the business empires of today. Almost every European or<br />    American<br />      businessman or CEO (the really famous ones and the not so famous<br />    ones) take<br />      time out to write books about how they got there, thier life, <br />  etc. Jack<br />      Welch, Gates, Ricardo Semler, Sam Walton, etc. This way people <br />  learn<br />    about<br />      thier exploits, mistakes, etc.</p>
<p>      Can you name one Indian businessman who has written a book of his<br />    exploits?<br />      Recently Kokila Ben launched a photograph collection of Dhirubhai<br />    Ambani's<br />      life but nothing else. Even the incredible Mr. Narayana Murthy has<br />    written<br />      very little about his life. Maybe im not aware of a few <br />  biogrpahies on<br />      Indian businessmen but the truth is the cupboard is bare when we<br />    cmpare with<br />      the Eurpeans and Americans. Thank god Dr.Kalam took time out for<br />    recording<br />      this. Even in Indian cricket Sunil Gavaskar has a biography and<br />    maybe a few<br />      other cricketers but absolutely nothing from some of the most <br />  incredible<br />      talents like GRV (i cant remember reading even an interview from <br />  this<br />      artist), Chandra, etc. Looks like we haven't learnt anything from<br />    our past.</p>
