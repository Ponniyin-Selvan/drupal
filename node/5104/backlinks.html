<p>In October 1931, Dr. H. G. Quaritch Wales, describing the Coronation <br />and Anointing Ceremonies of the seventh ruler of the present Chakri <br />Dynasty, King Prajadhipok (1925 1935), in his treatise on Siamese <br />State Ceremonies, 1 referred to the fact that the High Priest of <br />Siva, after rendering homage to the King who was seated on the <br />Bhadrapitha throne, pronounced the Tamil mantra, the Siamese name of <br />which (Poet pratu Sivalai) meant 'Opening the Portals of Sivalaya'. </p>
<p>Dr. Wales mentioned also in the same book that the Tamil mantra was <br />recited by Maharaja Gru of the Thai Court Brahmans also on the <br />occasion of another Siamese State Ceremony, namely, Triyambavay-<br />Tripavay (popularly known as Lo Jin Ja. ? 'Pulling the Swing') or <br />the Swinging Festival. Also, on the seventh day of the same festival <br />which used to be held annually in Bangkok and in the former capitals <br />of Ayudhya and Sukhodaya as well as in other chief cities of the <br />Thai realm such as Nakhorn Sri Thammarat (Ligor) in the first lunar <br />month and later in the second month, yet another mantra, called <br />Loripavay, was said to have been recited by four Brahmans.2</p>
<p>Then, in July 1955, Prof. Xavier S. Thani Nayagam, soon after a <br />successful study-tour of South-east Asian countries including Burma, <br />Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, published his paper on <br />Tamil Cultural Influences in South-east Asia in the Tamil Culture <br />(IV, 3, July 1955). It was in this paper that Prof. Thani Nayagam <br />made known for the first time the fact that the Tamil verses recited <br />at the Thai Coronation Ceremony and the Swinging Festival were those <br />from Manikkavacakar's Tiruvempavai.3</p>
<p>Subsequently in 1961, Prof. T. P. Meenakshisundaram wrote his <br />Cay?mil Tiruvempavai Tiruppavai,4 in which he gave an account in <br />Tamil of the Thai State Ceremonies including the Coronation Ceremony <br />and the Swinging Festival. Then in 1963, on his way back from a <br />visit to the University of Malaya, Prof. Meenakshisundaram visited <br />the Brahman Temple in Bangkok and ascertained that the Tamil mantra <br />mentioned by Dr. Wales in his book, consisted of Tevaram verses of <br />Tirundvukkaracar.</p>
<p>In the same year, the National Education (Indian Schools) <br />Development Council, Malaya, made provision for an Endowment Fund at <br />the University of Malaya for purposes of facilitating research in <br />the field of Tamil Cultural Contacts with Thailand and Cambodia. <br />With the assistance of the Research Funds made available for <br />carrying out research in Thailand, the writer of the present paper <br />was able to undertake a month-long field-trip to Thailand in April <br />1965. </p>
<p>In the course of this trip, thanks to the good offices of H. H. <br />Prince Dani Nivat Kromamun Bidyalabh, President of the Privy <br />Council, in Bangkok, the author of the present paper was able to <br />meet Phra Maharaja Gru, Vamadeva Muni, the present Chief Brahmanical <br />Priest of the Royal Thai Household, and Phragru Asadachariyan in the <br />Brahmin Temple 5 in Bangkok, and record recitation of the verses <br />entitled Part prata Sivalai (`Opening the portals of Sivalaya) Pit <br />pratu krailat (Closing the portals of Kailasa') and Laripavay (`Elor-<br />empavay', the refrain of the Tiruvempavai verses). He was also able <br />to obtain microfilm copies of the manuscripts containing these <br />verses written in the old South Indian Grantha script.6</p>
<p>With the help of the recorded recitation of Phra Maharaja Gru <br />Vamadeva Muni who recited the Pwt pratu Sivalai and the Pit pratu <br />Krailat, and that of Phra Gru Asadachariyan who recited the <br />Loripavay, and also with the assistance of the manuscripts <br />containing the texts of these verses, it has been possible to <br />identify (a) the poet pratu with the first eleven stanzas of the <br />first Tirumurai (beginning with 'to- tutaiya ceviyan') of the Tamil <br />Tevaram sung by Tirugnanacampantar, as well as with the first ten <br />verses of the seventh Tirumurai (beginning with `pitta pirai cuti <br />perumane') of Cuntarar; (b) the Pit pratu Krailat with the first ten <br />stanzas of the fourth Tirumurai 'Tiruvatikaivirattanam) sung by <br />Appar or Tirunavukkaracar, and (c) the Loripavay with the first <br />eleven verses of Tiruvempavai of Manikkavacakar's Tiruvacakam.</p>
<p>The immediate question arising from the identification of these <br />sacred Tamil verses of the Sivaite Tevaram is : How is it that the <br />recitation of these verses had become an integral part of the Thai <br />State Ceremonies of the Coronation and the Swinging Festival? It is <br />not easy to answer the question unless and until one is acquainted <br />with the historical background, particularly of religion, relating <br />to the peninsular region of South-east Asia in general and in the <br />territory now covered by Thailand in particular.</p>
<p>To begin with, let us briefly review the geographical features of <br />the present-day Thailand. Thailand is situated right in the middle <br />of the Indo-Chinese peninsula, hound by Burma on the west and partly <br />on the north-west, by Laos on the north, north-east and partly east, <br />and by Cambodia on the east. The southern part of the land juts deep <br />into the Malay peninsula between the Bay of Bengal and the South <br />China Sea. Topographically, the country may be divided into four <br />areas : the northern, the north-eastern, the central, and the <br />southern areas. </p>
<p>The northern area is mountainous terrain divided into four valleys <br />by the four rivers of Mae Ping, Mae Wang, Mae Yom, and the May Man <br />Nan, which finally unite their waters in the Maenam Chao Phraya <br />(`the mother-of-the-waters-in-chief') which is the principal river <br />of the Thai kingdom. (In Thailand, a river is correctly known as Mae <br />Nam ? mother of water, but this is often abbreviated to Mae or Nam.) <br />The north-eastern Thailand is a saucer-shaped plateau with the great <br />river of Mae Khong (Mekong) as its eastern boundary. The Central <br />Thailand is a large alluvial plain known as the Menam basin. Its <br />principal and well-known river is the Menam Chao Phraya. </p>
<p>On the left bank of this river, some forty kilometres from its <br />mouth, stands Bangkok (the official name in an abbreviated form is <br />Krungdep, 'the capital city of gods'), the capital of Thailand, <br />while on its right bank is located the city of Dhonburi which was <br />Thailand's capital some 190 years ago, after which Bangkok or <br />Krungdep became the Thai capital. The southern or the peninsular <br />Thailand consists of a long peninsula extending from the head of the <br />Gulf of Siam down to the northernmost Malaysian states of Perlis, <br />and Kedah.</p>
<p>Let us next review the demographical features of Thailand. In order <br />to understand the composition of the population of almost any <br />country in South and South-east Asia, it is necessary to remember <br />that the population of almost every country in the region has been <br />influenced by the great racial and tribal movements of people which <br />have been going on for millenia in the past. It is particularly <br />significant to note that the general direction of these movements <br />has been southwards and eastwards, and that even to this day there <br />are traces of this age-old tendency. The population of Thailand <br />would seem to have been no exception to the general tendency, in so <br />far as its composition has been influenced by no less than four main <br />waves of migration, namely, the Austronesian, the Mon-Khmer, the <br />Tibeto-Burman, and the Thai. (The terms used here must be regarded <br />as names of language groups, not necessarily of races.) Of these <br />four main waves of migration, the first two, i.e. the Austronesian <br />and the Mon-Khmer are surmised to have started from a western centre <br />(India?),7 while the latter two, the Tibeto-Burman and the Thai are <br />believed to have started from two different northern centres, one <br />probably from the eastern part of the Tibetan plateau, and the other <br />from southern China where several millions of Thai-speaking people <br />are said to remain to this day.</p>
<p>Of the origin and course of the Austronesian, very little is known, <br />except that the Austronesian wave probably under the pressure from <br />the next wave, the Mon-Khmer, advanced and peopled the islands and <br />the east Indian Archipelago, leaving behind remnants on the shores <br />of the mainland. (There are about 400,000 Austronesians ? Pattani <br />Malays and the sea-faring Chaonam or Chaole, also known as Orang <br />Laut in Malay, and as Seleung in Burmese, living in the territory of <br />Thailand today, most of them in the southern provinces.)</p>
<p>The Mon-Khmer group would seem to have comprised of no less than <br />fourteen sub-groups, 8 the most important of them being the Lawa, <br />Mon, Khmer, and the Annamite. It is reliably learnt that most of <br />deserted fortified towns and their tombs, especially in Muang Yuam <br />(Muang means 'town') to the west of Chiang-mai ('New City') as well <br />as from what is told in the northern chronicle, the Lawa were <br />formerly ruled by mighty kings, who headed large armies with <br />elephants to be used against the invading Mon, who after their <br />conquest of the Lawa about the seventh century A.D. began to people <br />the Menam plain and large tracts of northern Thailand prior to <br />arrival of the Thai.</p>
<p>The Khmers (or Cambodians) occupied the provinces of Buriram, Surin, <br />Khukhan, Ubon, Ratburi, and Kanchanaburi, while the Anna-mites were <br />settled in lower and the northern Thailand.</p>
<p>The Thai group, whose original home is said to have been probably in <br />south-western China, is known to have emigrated gradually into the <br />Indo-Chinese peninsula. During the period of migration, one of the <br />western off-shoots became the Shans of Burma. On the other side of <br />the peninsula, many of the Thai came into Tonking including the Laos <br />of the Lao state, and settled down in the Mekhong basin. Further <br />west of the Lao state in the northern direction were the northern <br />Thai of Chiangsen which was on the northern border of the present-<br />day Thailand. The various Thai groups of people who seem to have <br />been always on the move gradually settled themselves in the <br />peninsula in several small independent principalities.</p>
<p>Having thus reviewed briefly the diverse ethnic and language groups <br />of peoples who have in the course of time made up the population of <br />Thailand, it is important to stress that the various groups of <br />people who had come to settle down in the territory now known as <br />Thailand have intermixed not only with the natives of their adopted <br />land but also with each other and have become assimilated after a <br />few generations into a homogeneous whole. It is largely due to this <br />fact that the cultures of Thailand as expressed in her religion, <br />arts, literature, social system, habits, and customs reveal a unity <br />in a general sense with her neighbours, the Cambodians, the Mons, <br />and to a certain extent with the Burmese, and the Malays, but with <br />local or regional diversities in different proportions.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-----------</p>
<p>POLITICAL BACKGROUND</p>
<p>With regard to the political background of the country, it is <br />believed that between the 5th century A.D. and the 7th century A.D., <br />the northern and the western sectors as well as the central sector <br />of the territory were under the domination of the Indianized Mon-<br />speaking people of the Dvaravati kingdom, while the eastern sector, <br />comprising the basins of the Mun, and the Mae Khong formed largely <br />part of the ancient Hinduized Khmer empire between the 1st century <br />A.D. and the first half of the 13th century A.D., that is to say, <br />beginning from the Funan period (1st century A.D. ? C. A.D. 550) <br />through the Chenla period (A.D. 550 ? 802) and to the Kambuja or <br />Angkor period (A.D. 802-1215). </p>
<p>The southern region was under suzerainty of the Indianized Sumatran <br />empire of Sri Vijaya (A.D. 657 -- 1157). In the meantime, the Thai <br />as a race had been emigrating gradually from their home in southwest <br />China into the Indo-Chinese peninsula. Towards the 7th century A.D. <br />the Thais were in Yunnan where they had founded the powerful kingdom <br />of Nan-Chao. Subsequently they emigrated gradually into the fertile <br />plains of the peninsula watered by the Chao Phraya and Mae Khong, <br />and established themselves in several independent principalities. <br />There is no doubt that the Thai had been before that time already in <br />the land of the Mon and the Khmer empires, but they were only a <br />minority, and formed themselves into semi-independent <br />principalities.9</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-----------</p>
<p>CULTURAL BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The cultures of the pre-Thai period would seem to have been <br />influenced predominantly by Indian cultural elements particularly in <br />the field of religion : Both Buddhism and Brahmanism were the <br />religions of the Dvaravati, the Khmer and the Sri Vijaya empires <br />either alternately or sometimes even concurrently,10 but as far as <br />the Dvaravati kingdom was concerned, the predominant religion during <br />the period between the 4th and 8th century would seem to have been <br />Buddhism which gave expression to the Dvaravati art, possessing <br />characteristics of the Indian art of the Gupta period (4th century ? <br />5th century A.D.).</p>
<p>The bearers of these Indian elements to reach the Indo-Chinese <br />peninsula would seem to have been the Buddhist missionaries, <br />probably Sona-thera and Uttara-thera, and their companions who were <br />sent by King Ashoka (264 ? 227 B.c.) to Suvarnabhumi 11 around 243 <br />B.C. The form of Buddhism disseminated by the missionaries of King <br />Ashoka was the Theravada Buddhism. And it is also believed that it <br />was from places like Nakhorn Pathom that the Theravada Buddhism <br />spread further along the shores of the Gulf of Siam and even to <br />Cambodia.</p>
<p>About the end of the first century A.D., King Kanishka under whom <br />rose the Mahayana sect of Buddhism in the Punjab, sent missionaries <br />to China, Tibet, and Southern India. According to Dr. H. G. Quaritch <br />Wales it was from the latter point (Southern India), Mahayanism <br />spread to the Sumatra kingdom of Sri Vijaya.12 When this kingdom <br />extended its way over the Malay peninsula, Mahayana Buddhism reached <br />the southern sector of Siam as far as Pattani and Surathani. For <br />example, the Phra Maha Dhat of Jaiya and the Phra Maha of Nakhorn <br />Sri Tammarat (Ligor) are said to be stupas built in Sri Vijaya <br />style. The Buddha and Bodhisattva images found in Southern Thailand <br />are all made of the Mahayanist style. Mahayanism was to find its way <br />subsequently to Cambodian kingdom as well.</p>
<p>Apart from these trends of Buddhist influence, Brahmanism is also <br />known to have reached the Indo-Chinese peninsula in the early <br />centuries of A.D., first through the founder of the Kingdom of <br />Funan, Hun-T'ien (Kaundinya) and the Indian Brahmans who followed <br />him. Kaundinya (1st century A.D.) is said to have married Liu-yeh of <br />Funan, and they had a son who succeeded to the throne and thus <br />founded the First Kaundinya dynasty. Subsequently, about the <br />beginning of the fifth century, an Indian Brahman from P'an-P'an, <br />who was either named Kaundinya or assumed the name of the earlier <br />Indian immigrant ruler, became king of Funan.</p>
<p>Prof. Jean Filliozat in his paper on the Tamil influence in <br />Southeast Asia has drawn attention to the Tamil Purananuru poem of <br />the Classical period in which the poet Avur Mulankilar eulogises the <br />great valour demonstrated by one Kauniyan Vinnantayan's ancestors in <br />conquering the enemies of Siva (Purananuru, 166: 1-9). According to <br />the colophon suffixed to the verse of Purananuru, Kauniyan <br />Vinnantayan was a Parppan (literally a 'Seer', but later used to <br />refer to a brahman in the Tamil country) of Puncirrur in the Cola <br />country in South India, and Kauniyan was of the Kaundinya KOttiram <br />(gotra). Prof. Filliozat is of the opinion that though the Kaundinya <br />gotra (or sect) was of north Indian origin, the members of the sect <br />or clan had played an important role in upholding Sivaism in South <br />India. It is also significant that the Kaundinyan of the Cola <br />country and the Kaundinya of the Funan kingdom were both keenly <br />interested in safeguarding Sivaism at about the same historical <br />period, and also that they both claimed descent from the same <br />ancestry.</p>
<p>Some of the important changes which appear to have taken place <br />during this early period of brahmanization in the Indo-Chinese <br />peninsula were: (a) The systematization and extension of the worship <br />of brahmanical deities, especially the state worship of Siva-linga <br />under the vocable of Mahesvara, (b) The introduction of South India <br />alphabet,13 and (c) The introduction of the Saka era which was in <br />common use on the South-east coast of India.</p>
<p>Of these developments, the establishment of worship of Siva-linga as <br />the central cult of the state, which seems to have taken place about <br />this time in Fun an as it did in Champa as well, is particularly <br />noteworthy. Siva, originally believed to have been a Vedic god <br />(Rudra) later known as Siva the destroyer in the Brahmanic system of <br />Trimurthi (Brahma, Siva, and Vishnu) came to be worshipped in <br />Southern India, Indo-China, and Indonesia as the god of change and <br />therefore of reproduction. He was generally represented in the <br />temples by the form of the linga, the male symbol of generation, <br />which in Indo-Chinese peninsula came to be stylized as a vertical <br />cylinder with a square base, an octagonal upright column and an <br />oblong dome. The royal linga of the state, under the vocable of <br />Mahesvara (the great Isvara = Siva) was placed in a temple on the <br />hill (signifying the Ma h?meru) which formed the centre of every <br />capital of Indianized Indo-China and became identified with the <br />welfare of the state.</p>
<p>The worship of the Siva-linga seems, from the first, to have been <br />recognized as a State Cult in Funan, later on in other autochthonous <br />kingdoms of the Indo-Chinese peninsula. It did not interfere with <br />the worship of other gods. Indeed, the syncretism of the worship of <br />the Sivaite Mahesvara and the Mahayanist Lokesvara, which forms such <br />an interesting chapter in the later history of Indian religions in <br />Indo-China, seems to have been in its early stages during the pre-<br />Thai period. All through the history of the Cambodian kingdoms, <br />until the simple worship of Sinhalese Theravada Buddhism was <br />introduced, kings who were fervent Vishnuites and Mahayana Buddhists <br />are known to have carefully observed all the rites connected with <br />the state worship of Mahesvara.14 (Even to this day, the Bako in <br />Theravadist Cambodia and the Phra Maharaja Gru of Thailand who have <br />charge of certain important rites and ceremonies are Brahmans whose <br />hereditary functions in connexion with the extinct State-Cult are <br />still respected.)</p>
<p>Together with Sivaism, the cult of Vishnu would also seem to have <br />found a place in the religious life of the Khmer kingdom as <br />evidenced by the fact that statues of Vishnu, with cylindrical <br />coiffure of the Gupta period (A.D. 320 ? 600) have been found all <br />over the regions covered by the kingdom.15 In this context, mention <br />may also be made of the remains, found at Srideb in what is now <br />Central Siam, of an ancient city containing some ruins of towers, <br />several statues, chiefly images of Vishnu, believed by Dr. Wales <br />(who explored the site in 1935-1936) to date at least from the first <br />quarter of the sixth century A.D. The architecture and art are <br />admitted by Dr. Wales to be purely Indian, without any resemblance <br />to either ancient or classical Khmer art. The connexion of Srideb <br />with Mon settlements in the Mekhong-Menam delta, has not yet been <br />worked out satisfactorily. In spite of their differences in <br />religion ? Srideb was Vishnuite, while Dvaravati was Buddhist ? they <br />seem to have existed in close contact with each other.</p>
<p>In later years (Chenla period), the chief sculptures would appear to <br />have been statues of Harihara, half - Vishnu and half -Siva, whose <br />worship characterised the seventh century Chenla, particularly the <br />reign of Isanavarman I. These statues of sand-stone, varied from one <br />to two metres in height, but were generally about the natural size <br />of a man. The upper arms, when not broken, were joined to the arm of <br />support and held the trident of Siva and the discus and conch of <br />Vishnu. The lower arm on the Siva side held the jewel, while on the <br />Vishnu side it rested on the club of Vishnu, which formed part of <br />the support. The coiffure was cylindrical, the jam of Siva on the <br />right. </p>
<p>This interesting form of Harihara (also known as Sambhu-Vishnu) is <br />said to have first appeared on the rocks of Badami and Mahavellipur <br />in South India, in the Pallava country some time before A.D. 450. <br />The fact that there was such a worship of the compound deity, Vishnu-<br />Siva, indicates that there was no serious hostility between the <br />principal Sivaite cult and Vishnuism in the ancient Cambodian <br />kingdom.16</p>
<p>This kind of syncretism of Sivaism and Vishnuism is one of the most <br />interesting facts of the history of religions in South-east Asia. <br />[No less similar was the syncretism between Sivaism and Mahayana <br />Buddhism during the reign of Yasovarman I (A.D. 889 ? 900): For some <br />time the ancient University of Nalanda in Maghada, North India, had <br />been a centre of Mahayana influence, where Buddhist doctrines mixed <br />with Sivaism, Shamanism, Tantrism, magic practices etc. were <br />elaborated.17 The Sailendra Maharajas, all powerful in the <br />archipelago, were enthusiastic worshippers of this religion. The <br />influence of the religion was not wholly Mahayanist, for at that <br />time a peculiar syncretism is said to have been taken place at <br />Nalanda between Mahayanism and Sivaism, and the twofaiths were <br />working side by side in perfect harmony.]</p>
<p>Another important religious development in the pre-Thai period <br />(especially towards the end of Chenla period) was the religious <br />foundation of priestly family which came to hold the hereditary <br />position of hotar (royal chaplain) and purohita (chief priest) for <br />the Deva-raja18 (royal god). It is said that this tradition was <br />initiated during the early part of the Kambuja period by Jayavarman <br />II (A.D. 802) on his return from a trip to Java to the court of the <br />Sailendra Maharaja.19</p>
<p>According to the Sdok Kak Thom inscription, a wise guru, named <br />Sivakaivalya, was chosen as hotar, and he was ordered by the king to <br />bring all his family, with women and children. The king also gave <br />orders to grant Sivakaivalya a piece of land to establish a sruk <br />(village) called Kuti and assign it to him as residence. This <br />sacerdotal hierarchy would also seem to have been introduced hand in <br />hand with the establishment of the Devaraja cult. To begin with, <br />Jayavarman II moved his capital to the site of the royal city of <br />Hariharalaya (abode of Harihara) and established the Devaraja cult <br />on Mount Mahendra which was of suitable eminence for the location of <br />his tower-temple for the royal god (Devaraja) which idea he had <br />probably borrowed from Java, in imitation of the central mountain <br />and temple of Siva on Mount Kailasa. The inscription of Sdok Kak <br />Thom continues : </p>
<p>"Then His Majesty Paramesvara (posthumous name of Jayavarman II) <br />went as Kurung (king) on the Mahendra parvata and Sivakaivalya went <br />also to reside in this city for the service of His Majesty as it <br />already had been established Then a Brahman named Hiranyadama, <br />skilled in magic science, came from Janapada, because His Majesty <br />Paramesvara had invited him to perform a ceremony that would make it <br />impossible for this country of the Kambuja to pay any allegiance to <br />Java and that there should be, in this country, one sole sovereign, <br />who should be Chakravartin."20 </p>
<p>Hiranyadama prepared the ritual for the royal linga bestowing upon <br />the king the power of Chakravartin, of which the linga was the <br />symbol, a sort of ceremony establishing the divine right of king.</p>
<p>This ceremony is said to have taken place in A.D. 802. It was the <br />Khmer declaration of Independence. It had the effect of establishing <br />the Supreme Government by divine sanction and of rendering <br />Kambujadesa independent of Java. What was the nature of the ceremony <br />by which a Chakravartin king was seated on the throne, thus at one <br />stroke making the Khmer king sovereign over all the chieftains in <br />the Kambuja?</p>
<p>The inscription of Sdok Kak Thom says Hiarnyadama brought the memory <br />of four holy texts which he used in preparing the magic formula. <br />Then he recited them from beginning to end in order to reduce them <br />to writing and to teach Sivakaivalya to make the formula. Then he <br />directed Sivakaivalya to make the ritual concerning the Devaraja, <br />i.e. the institution of the royal linga under the vocable of the <br />first part of the king's name plus Isvara (Siva), thereby <br />identifying the king with Siva, ? a sort of apotheosis of the king <br />during his life. (The king-god was conceived to be the eternal <br />abstract essence of the king confounded with the divine essence and <br />worshipped in the form of a linga.) "This miraculous linga," says <br />Prof. Coed?s, "sort of palladium of the kingdom, is generally <br />considered as having been obtained from Siva, by the intermediary of <br />a Brahman who gives it to the king founder of the dynasty "21 The <br />sage Bhrgu is said to have performed the same service for Uroja, <br />founder of the dynasty of Indrapura in Champa in A.D. 875.22 <br />Agastya, the legendary saint of the Tamil country, seems to have <br />performed a similar service for Java in A.D 760.23</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the Devaraja cult was that Jayavarman <br />made the celebration of the cult of the Devaraja hereditary in the <br />head of the family of Sivakaivalya. This raised Sivakaivalya to the <br />position of supreme pontiff and established a sort of sacerdotal <br />hierarchy in Cambodia. The succession is said to have been <br />matrilineal (matrivamsa).</p>
<p>In this context, mention must also be made of the tradition <br />according to which the Devaraja changed residence according to the <br />capitals where the monarch conducted him to watch over the royal <br />power of the monarchs who succeeded each other. Of course, the chief <br />priest of the Devaraja accompanied the royal god to whatever capital <br />to which the monarch moved.</p>
<p>The chief priest was either Sivaite or Vishnuite according to <br />whether the monarch's general views were Sivaite or Vishnuite. For <br />instance, during the reign of Jayavarman III, a Vishnuite king (his <br />posthumous name was Vishnuloka), the Brahmin Krishnapala Amarendra, <br />called Kesavabhatta, is believed to have been the chief priest of <br />the worship of Vishnu.</p>
<p>The function of the hotar sometimes included that of a guru. Thus <br />the closest associates of the monarch were the chief purohita or <br />hotar, who was assisted by other hotars, the guru and ministers.</p>
<p>The purohitas and the gurus would seem to have been well-versed in <br />the sastras. For instance, Sivasoma, the guru and apparently the <br />chief adviser of Indravarman I (A.D. 877 ? 889) is said to have <br />learned the sastras from the Bhagavat Samkara who Prof. Coedes <br />thinks was the great Hindu philosopher Sankaracharya, who had just <br />restored orthodox Brahmanism in India.24</p>
<p>Several of the royal priests would actually seem to have been of the <br />royal line on account of the practice of the monarchs who took the <br />precaution of binding the purohita to the royal family by marriage. <br />(Survayavarman I, a Mahayanist Buddhist, came from Tambralinga and <br />became king of Cambodia in 1011; he is said to have taken the <br />cautious step before he took a member of the family of the Sivaite <br />Sivacharya and making him a Royal Chaplain and using him in the <br />construction of public works.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-----------</p>
<p>SYNCRETISM OF BRAHMANISM AND MAHAYANA BUDDHISM</p>
<p>During the reign of Jayavarman VII (A.D. 1181 ? 1215), Mahayanist <br />Buddhism seems to have been dominant. The rise of the cult of <br />Avalokitesvara (or Lokesvara) in Kambujadesa is said to have given a <br />great impulse to the syncretism of religions there, especially that <br />of Lokesvara Mahayanism and Mahesvara Sivaism. (The personage of <br />Mahayana Buddhism who figures most in the iconography and <br />inscriptions of South-east Asia is the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara or <br />Lokesvara. Lokesvara is usually represented as standing in the <br />chalice of a lotus flower. He is the god of compassion. Like Siva, <br />Lokesvara is often represented with four arms and sometimes with <br />four faces, looking towards the four cardinal points.)25</p>
<p>Sivaism had its counterpart to the doctrine of the compassionate <br />Lokesvara in the cult of Mahesvara, which was associated with linga <br />in Indo-China. These two cults are said to have become so similar <br />that they sometimes flourished side by side without friction. <br />Indeed, the syncretism is said to have even extended to the <br />personality and attributes of the two deities Lokesvara is pictured <br />at Angkor with four faces and sometimes with the trident and even <br />the frontal eye of Siva 26 Mention was already made that the <br />syncretism of Sivaism and Vishnuism probably resulted in the <br />substitution of Vishuraja for the Devaraja. During the reign of <br />Jayavarman VII, the syncretism between Sivaism and Mahayana Buddhism <br />would seem to have resulted in the substitution of Buddharaja.27</p>
<p>Thus far, an attempt was made to trace in brief outline the main <br />religious trends in the Indo-Chinese kingdoms during the pre-Thai <br />period (roughly between 1st century A.D. and the early part of the <br />13th century A.D.). It now remains for us to consider the historical <br />significance of these cultural trends in the sphere of religion of <br />the pre-Thai period to the cultural trends in the kingdom or <br />kingdoms which were the successors of the already far-flung but <br />extremely weakening empire of Kambujadesa. But before embarking upon <br />a consideration of the cultural trends, something must be said of <br />the important political developments that took place in the Indo-<br />Chinese peninsula at the turn of the 13th century AD</p>
<p>According to the master of Indo-Chinese studies, Prof. George <br />Coed?s, the 13th century in South-east Asia marks a veritable <br />turning point in the history of the region.28 Prof. Coed?s is of the <br />opinion that it was the Mongols under their great chief, Gengis <br />Khan, who caused such a disturbance to the old kingdoms of South-<br />east Asia that history in the region took another direction turning <br />on different scenes and different peoples. Gengis Khan, since the <br />time of his accession as the Chief of the Turko-Mongol tribes in <br />1206 was seeking to obtain vassal tribute from foreign sovereigns. <br />After the accomplishment of conquering an empire that extended from <br />Canton to the banks of the Black Sea and to the Persian Gulf, the <br />Mongols turned their attention to Japan and South-east Asia. Japan <br />however was for the Mongols a complete check that was to end in <br />disaster later in 1281. Their attempts were equally unsuccessful in <br />Vietnam in 1287, after fruitlessly trying to stamp out the Cham <br />resistance. But the Mongols found some kind of recompense in Burma, <br />and in 1287 after three campaigns their expedition finally took <br />Pagan. Of course this episode had no lasting political consequences <br />for the Mongol empire, but their political repercussions in South-<br />east Asian political scene were far reaching. These in effect <br />consisted in the temporary disappearance of the Burmese royalty.</p>
<p>Somewhat earlier than this time, i.e. in A.D. 1220, Jayavarman VII <br />of Cambodia died. This event, according to Prof. Coed?s, again <br />provided the Thais of the middle Menam (under the leadership of Khun <br />Sri Indradit and his able son, Khun Rama Kamhaeng) with an <br />opportunity to free themselves from Khmer suzerainty and establish <br />the kingdom of Sukhodaya in about 1257.</p>
<p>Subsequently in 1287, the fall of Pagan furnished another <br />opportunity for the Thais to divide and share the power in south, <br />notably at Martaban and others in small fiefs clustered on the rice <br />culture plain at the bend of Irawadi beyond Pagan. At the same time <br />(1287) Mang-ray, prince of Chiang Rai, and Ngan Muong, prince of <br />P'ayao, and Rama Kamkhaeng, king of Sukhodaya, gathered together, <br />and concluded a firm pact of friendship and then parted, each to <br />return to his own country. In the following year (1288), Mangray <br />began to make ready for the conquest of the old Mon-kingdom of <br />Haripunjaya (Lam-pun) which he concluded in 1292, and in 1296, he <br />founded a new capital at Chiang Mai (New City). At the same time, <br />another signatory of the 1287 pact, Rama Kamkhaeng, king of <br />Sukhodaya, achieved hegemony over a greater number of Thai groups <br />and considerably enlarged his territory.</p>
<p>The direct and most important results of the events of the 13th <br />century on the Indo-Chinese peninsula were: (1) The accession to <br />independence of the Thais. (2) The succession of the Thai chiefs to <br />a certain number of Burmese principalities in the Irawadi basin. (3) <br />The decline of the old Khmer empire owing to Thai liberation. (4) <br />The implantation of the Thais on the Malay peninsula and the <br />consequent fall of the Sumatran empire of Sri Vijaya during the time <br />of the Javanese kingdom of Majapahit.</p>
<p>Now, turning to the Thai kingdom, after a century of brilliance, <br />Sukhodaya (also known as Sukhothai) became a vassal state of the <br />kingdom of Ayudhya, founded by King Ramadhibodi I (Prince of U-<br />thong) in 1350. The history of the kingdom of Ayudhya may be divided <br />into five periods. During the first period (covering the reigns of <br />King Ramadhibodi, 1350 ? 1969, and that of his four immediate <br />successors) Ayudhya's suzerainty was established over the <br />neighbouring Thai principalities. During the second period, the <br />kingdom was further extended especially in the north. </p>
<p>The third period (1533 ? 1605) was that of the great wars with the <br />neighbours, especially the Burmese, and the opening of trade <br />relations with the Europeans. During the fifth period, Ayudhya was <br />invaded by the Burmese (in 1763), and after four years of fierce <br />battle was completely destroyed in 1767. One of the generals of the <br />last king of Ayudhya, known as Phra Chao Tak Sin succeeded in <br />driving the enemies of the country away, and became king of <br />Thailand, and established his capital in Dhonburi, a city on the <br />right bank of the river, Caho Phrya (Menam). </p>
<p>After a reign of several years (1767 ? 1781), he is said to have <br />been seized by religious delusions. One of his generals, Chao Phrya <br />Chakri, on his return from his victorious campaign against Cambodia, <br />proclaimed himself king in 1782, and established his capital on the <br />opposite bank of the Menam on the actual site of the present <br />Bangkok. King Chao Phrya Chakri, also known as Rama I (1782-1809) <br />was succeeded by Phra Buddha Loet La Naphalai or Rama II (1809-<br />1824). The other kings of the Chakri dynasty were: Phra Nang Klao, <br />Rama III (1824 ? 1851), Phra Chom Klao or Rama IV, better known as <br />King Mogkut (1851 ? 1868), Phra Chula Chom Klao or Rama V (King <br />Chulalongkorn, 1868 ? 1910), Phra Mongkut Klao or Rama VI (King <br />Vajiravudh, 1910 ? 1925), Phra Pok Klao or King Prajadhipok (1925 ? <br />1934) and King Ananda Mahidol (1934 ? 1946). The present king is <br />King Bhumiphol Adundet.</p>
<p>Turning now to the consideration of the religious trends during the <br />Thai period, it must first be noted that much of the various Indian <br />religious influence would seem to have been brought to bear on the <br />Thai way of life rather indirectly by way of the Indianized kingdoms <br />of Dvaravati, Sri Vijaya, and Cambodia during the pre-Thai period. <br />One can trace this influence of the Indianized Khmer kingdom upon <br />the Thai court ceremonials and other aspects of their culture, <br />particularly after the Thais established their own kingdom of <br />Sukhodaya, independent of the sovereignty of the Kambuja. First of <br />all, making due allowance for the rise of the Theravada Buddhism and <br />the passing of the power of the Brahmans (even in Cambodia) and the <br />modifications incidental to changing conditions generally, one has <br />reason to believe that the Thai kings soon after they declared <br />complete independence from the Cambodian empire, surrounded <br />themselves with the various appurtences of the erstwhile great Khmer <br />royalty, particularly the court Brahmans whom they at first <br />recruited from Cambodia 29 where they could be found in large <br />numbers probably because they were no longer required by the local <br />rulers to consecrate their power of which they had none.</p>
<p>There has been this vital connexion between Monarchy and Brahmanism <br />for centuries in the past: Although Buddhism soon became the <br />religion of the people as well as their rulers, Brahmanical <br />consecration of the sovereignty of the ruler through the chanting of <br />their magical formula was still essential to the monarchy. The <br />chanting of these formula or mantras were mostly observances for <br />which Buddhism had not provided, for the observances were such as <br />Buddha would have classed them among low arts'; nevertheless public <br />opinion and perhaps the higher echelons themselves had greater <br />confidence in the skill and power of the Brahmans.</p>
<p>As for the influence of the Brahmans in Thai court life, mention may <br />be made of the Thai book entitled R'oang Nang Nabamasa, or the story <br />of Lady Nabamasa which is considered a great source book of <br />Brahmanical and other traditions of the Thai royalty. The author of <br />the book is supposed to have been the daughter of a Brahman at the <br />court of the kings of Sukhodaya.</p>
<p>During the Ayudhya period also, court Brahmans are known to have <br />been recruited from time to time both from Cambodia and from the <br />peninsula, and most probably from South India as well. (The earliest <br />account of the Bangkok court Brahmans is that of Crawford,30 who <br />visited Thailand on an embassy in 1821. One of the Brahmans whom he <br />met is said to have told Crawford that he was the fifth in descent <br />from his ancestor who had first settled in Thailand, and who <br />according to the statement of the Brahman came from the island of <br />Ramesvaram in South India. Now, making an allowance of an average of <br />thirty years for each generation of this Brahman family, the Brahman <br />who came first to settle in Thailand must have lived at least 150 <br />years before 1821 (the year of Crawford's mission), i.e. 1671, which <br />year also happens to correspond to the reign of King Narayana of <br />Ayudhya (1657 ? 1658) who is said to have favoured Brahmanism. 31</p>
<p>Just as in the ancient Khmer Empire, the Brahmans at the Thai court <br />would seem to have been charged with several functions. One of them <br />was to interpret supernatural omens to the kings. The Brahmans also <br />helped in the work of calendar-making, and fixing the auspicious <br />days for the State Ceremonies. The Brahman, i.e. the chief among <br />them, was also a royal chaplain. Of all these functions, the most <br />important one was to officiate at the State Ceremonials, <br />particularly the Anointing and Crowning ceremony.</p>
<p>According to H. H. Prince Dhani Nivat,32 coronation in Thailand <br />since the time of the inauguration of the Chakri dynasty, has been <br />carried out in accordance with the reconstructed system of the <br />ceremony drawn (on the basis of the corresponding ceremonies of the <br />Ayudhya period) by a Royal Commission appointed by the founder of <br />the dynasty, King Rama I. Later King Mongkut (1851 ? 1868) probably <br />added much to the old rites in order to reconcile their Brahmanical <br />nature (in other word, syncretise) with the people's national <br />religion of Theravada Buddhism.</p>
<p>The actual ceremony of the Thai coronation, or rather the Anointing <br />and Crowning ritual, which is believed to legalise a king's <br />accession to the throne, consists of a benediction of the precincts <br />of the Maha Montien (the Great Residence of the King) in which the <br />waters of anointment are also blessed. This benediction is carried <br />out on three successive evenings by three separate chapters of <br />abbots, while the high abbot chants a proclamation inviting all to <br />give their moral support to the great national festival being held <br />by His Majesty the King for the benefit of the realm. </p>
<p>Meanwhile Brahmanical ceremonies to bless anointment and invoke the <br />gracious attitudes of Hindu deities take place in a separate <br />building within the Grand Palace. The king then goes through a <br />purificatory ritual after which he seats himself on the octagonal <br />throne, shaded by the white canopy of the State, facing east. He <br />then receives the invitation to rule from the representatives of the <br />people. The king accepts the invitation by receiving an anointment <br />poured down his hand and sprinkles it on his head and turns round <br />successively to other sectors of the octagonal throne. [This is <br />believed to represent an earlier Cambodian tradition of Indian <br />origin by which the monarch who, wherever he went, acknowledged the <br />loyalty of the people from all the (eight) quarters of his kingdom.] </p>
<p>The king then walks over to the Bhadrabitha throne where the High <br />Priest of Siva chants the verses of the 'Opening the Portals of <br />Sivalai', inviting the great god to pervade the person of His <br />Majesty. The High Priest of Siva then hands to the king the five <br />principal articles of the royal regalia, namely, the great Crown of <br />Victory, which the king himself puts on his head amidst fanfare; the <br />auspicious Sword of Victory, supposed to have been the Sword of <br />State from the time of the great Khmer emperor, Suryavarman, and <br />presented by a later Khmer monarch to King Rama I; the Golden <br />Sandals sanctified by the tradition of their grass originals having <br />been the symbol of the sovereign power of the ancient Indian hero, <br />Rama; the Fan and the Sceptre, thus making up the set of five <br />articles of the royal regalia. Other articles are handed to the king <br />afterwards : the Brahman girdle, an attribute of Siva, the discus, <br />the traditional weapon of Vishnu, the sword, the gun, (a weapon of <br />recent times) and other weapons of the regalia. </p>
<p>Then the king addresses the High Priest of Siva, extending his <br />authority over the realm, exhorting at the same time all to live in <br />peace. To this injunction, the High Priest of Siva replies on behalf <br />of the people : 'I do receive the first gracious word of command <br />given by Your Majesty.' In the afternoon, the king grants a formal <br />audience in the throne hall of Amarindra surrounded by the members <br />of his court. This is in brief the Anointing and Coronation ceremony <br />as it took place in 1950.</p>
<p>Now, to pose again the question raised at the beginning of this <br />paper: How is it that the Brahmanical recitation of Tamil Sivaite <br />verses of the Tevaram (i.e. 'Opening the Portals of Sivalai) have <br />become an important feature of the Thai coronation ceremony ? The <br />probable answer would seem to lie in the fact that the verses <br />concerned are of Sivaite character, and their recital by a Brahman <br />is meant to invite Siva down so that he might become merged in the <br />person of the king. In this context, we may recall that a similar <br />belief was largely responsible for the establishment and maintenance <br />of the hereditary Brahmanical sacerdotal family of Sivakaivalya in <br />the ancient kingdom of Cambodia. </p>
<p>In such a system of belief, the Brahman has played an important, <br />perhaps an indispensable role, as an intermediary between the King <br />and Siva. The Tamil Sivaite hymns of the Tevaram (and Tiruvempavai <br />verses) which are recited by the Thai Court Brahmans might well have <br />reached Thailand through the Brahmans of South India. It is <br />significant to note that the Sivaite tradition, believed to have <br />been introduced first by a member of the Kaundinya sect of South <br />India around the first century A.D. is kept alive to this day in <br />Thailand by the services of Phra Maharaja Gru whose ancestors are <br />also said to have come from South India. Finally, when we recall the <br />Tamil poet and author of the Purananuru poem (166), Avur <br />Mulankilar's hope and wish that Kauniyan Vinnantayan's meritorious <br />service of protecting Sivaism would continue as long as there is the <br />Himalayas, it is rather tempting to surmise that the Tamil poet <br />might as well have been addressing the first Kaundinya, the founder <br />of the kingdom of Funan in South-east Asia.</p>
