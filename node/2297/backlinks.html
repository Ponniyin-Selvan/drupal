</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear members,<br />not all of us can go on the trip to the locales mentioned in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym .<br />some of us are abroad<br />some tied up with other work<br />and some have already seen the places<br />my suggestion is<br />the group going to these locations must be a healthy mix of 75% who <br />havent seen the places and 25 % who are knowledgable about it.<br />but there can be greater participation of all members.</acronym></p>
<p>to start with we can all give suggestions of what to see.<br />they can be place names from <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym .<br />also must see places around these areas</acronym></p>
<p>we can all work to create a data base on the significance of the <br />place in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym </p>
<p>like for example in kadambur</p>
<p>we can say <br />1.the story started here when vanthiyathevan stayed overnight'<br />2.the main event ( murder of a.karikalan) took place here<br />3. finally manimekalai dies here.<br />i am enclosing a list of places in volume 1</p>
<p>1. viranam lake<br />2. viranarayanapura vinnagaram<br />3. kadambur<br />4. kollida karai<br />5. kudanthai josiyer house( near kali temple?)<br />6. arisilatrangarai ( the episode of the stuffed croc)<br />7. pagaivan palli padai ( thiru purambayam)( alvarku adiyan)<br />8. thanjavur<br />9. pazhaiyarai<br />10. vadametrali ( isaana siva battars house)</p>
<p>11. maamalla puram( aaditya karikalan)</p>
<p>we could send across the whole data base with those going on the <br />trip. should make their experience more enjoyable.</p>

<p>regards</p>
<p>Sri</p>
<p>Ponniyin Selvan Mudhal Yathirai &#150; Payanakkatturai</p>
<p>By Pavithra Srinivasan</p>
<p>Dear all...</p>
<p>Thanks to all the people who wished us luck on our way- your wishes reached us and made our trip a success. :-)</p>
<p>Here's what happened in the last three days (four, if you count Feb. 6th too):</p>
<p>Day 0 (Thursday, February 6th, Night):</p>
<p>We'd planned to start from the TTD Temple on Venkatnarayana Road, which was our meeting point. Sathya, Lavanya, Anuradha, Mr. Srinivasan Mr. Vishwaksenan Krupashankar and I were meeting there, while the rest would join us in Tambaram. After duly paying our respects at the TTD (for the success of the trip and all that:-), we waited for the tempo-traveler and it arrived in a few minutes. All of us got in and made ourselves comfortable. That was around 8.20 PM.</p>
<p>All of us had met fleetingly at the Kalki office- but that was a rather rushed affair, with discussions of the route map, travel plans and introductions. So the van-ride was our first opportunity to get to know each other, which was what we did in detail:-). We settled into the plush seats and sat talking until Tambaram, after which Kamalakkannan, Viji ma'am (his wife), Mr. Seetha Ram Sharma, Mr. VijayaKumar and his daughter Radhika got in. It became a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of a squash then, because we were one seat short. It resulted in five of us squeezed in the four-seater in the back, with the rest spread out all over the van- but we didn't mind that- everything was too new and exciting:-). Kamal had brought along his Handycam, and a good many of us had brought along cameras with bundles of rolls- so we had every expectation of covering everything in detail.</p>
<p>By 9 PM, we had really started. We lurched out towards the outskirts of Chennai, towards Mayavaram, our first destination. The route map specified Chidambaram as the first night's halt, but Mayavaram was decided upon, because one Mr. Seetharaman, a friend of Mr. Sunder Bharadwaj (the person who supplied us with all the valuable info for the current route map, friend of Mr. Balakumaran, the writer), had informed us that we could stay in Hotel Prince Towers, his own home ground. We didn't realize, at that moment, just how valuable Mr. Seetharaman would prove to be. That would come later.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, all of us <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  Trippers (what a word) had plenty to catch up on. Aside from those of us who'd met at the Kalki office, there were a few newbies, like Mr. Vijayakumar and his daughter- and then there was the speech made by Mr. Balakumaran, especially for us enthusiasts. It was a masterpiece in its own way- it really set the tone for the trip.</p>
<p>"Yogi Ram Surat Kumar Yogi Ram Surat Kumar Yogi Ram Surat Kumar JeyaguruRaya. Ponniyin Selvan rasigargalukku..."</p>
<p>It began, and then followed a detailed and (sometimes) emotional description of the places we *must* see, what we must look for, about Raja raja Chozhan, about his life, the people he worked with, the temples he built, the conditions they were in...his voice worked its own magic. Sitting there in the semi-darkness, we felt ourselves slipping away into the magical world of the Cholas a 1000 years ago, where kings and queens raised huge temples, gave away numerous lands, fought enormous battles and won huge respect and loyalty from their people. If it were this way just thinking about it, what would it be like, actually visiting them? It would be a walk inside history, no less.</p>
<p>After a couple of hours of film songs and conversation, everyone began dozing- it was after midnight. At 2.20 AM, our van lurched to a stop outside a building with vehicles standing about in a garage-like place. A few dogs ran about here and there, two or three people with shawls thrown over their faces appeared. We dragged out our suitcases and marched into the Hotel Prince Towers. Maayavaram had arrived.</p>
<p>Day 1 (Friday,February 7th):</p>
<p>Day 1 saw us starting on the trip from Maayavaram at 7.30 AM (with a wake-up call at 6 AM that got us tumbling out of beds). I'd like to express my thanks to Mr. Seetharaman, the GM of Hotel Prince Towers, Maayavaram, on behalf of all the people who participated in the trip, and those of the e-group. He was a great guide, and he provided us with excellent accommodation at a discount. Thanks Mr. SR! </p>
<p>We bundled ourselves into the van again and started out on the real journey through Chozha Naadu. The countryside was waking up as we drove through it. Soon we'd left 'civilization' behind, and were driving through shrubbery, canals with water and sand alternating, and huge stacks of hay dotting the roads. The breeze was fresh, the sky was a sparkling blue. Lavanya had brought along an apt tape- a tape of songs Kalki had written-both on-screen and off-screen. Favorites were "Maalaip pozhuthinile..." and "Kaatrinile varum geetham..." Listening to his songs, driving through the lush fields and groves was an extremely pleasant experience. Kalki would have been pleased, I think. :-)</p>
<p>SR informed us that it would take us 45 minutes to reach Kadambur- our first stop. (yes, yes, the same place where the 'Sathi thittam' takes place at midnight right at the beginning of the 1st paagam).</p>
<p>Abruptly, we left the 'tar' roads, and turned onto a muddy track that seemed to wind endlessly along the banks of a wide canal. There were deep cart-tracks etched onto the surface, that reminded one forcibly of the tracks of a huge 'ratham', driven a 1000 years ago:-)- and we promptly converted our tempo-traveler into a huge 'ther', with our driver Murugan as the 'Therotti'(He didn't seem to enjoy the designation- wrestling with the wheel took up most of his attention). After a few minutes of meandering through ruts and potholes that shook us all up terribly (Mr. Sharma kept commenting that if we'd had breakfast, it'd have been digested in double-quick time)- we came to a cross-roads -one track led over the canal, the other vanished into the shrubbery. We asked for directions, and one villager told us helpfully that we'd come on the wrong road to Kadambur, that we should have driven into another road before this cart-track, so would we reverse?</p>
<p>There were groans all around, and the therotti turned the van around (a difficult task, but nothing compared to what happened later, at the Viranam Eri:-), and we bumped our way towards an intersection we'd missed earlier. Another villager pointed out that this road was a 'nalla rodu'- and we found it a nalla rodu too- it was filled to the brim with good, fresh hay. The van plunged through bundle hay, towards Mel Kadambur- the first of the two villages into which the once-prosperous original county has now degenerated. It's about 30 kilometers from Chidambaram. We came from Maayavaram, passing through Panthanallur, Manalmedu, etc. It had taken us more than two hours totally (it was close to 10 AM when we arrived)- and according to the van, we had traveled 62 kms.</p>
<p>A blue board placed at a turning to the temple sported the words 'Ponniyin Selvanin Nigazhkalam'- that was the first thing that caught our attention. It went on to list the temple's name, where it was located etc.. When we came to a stop, the temple arose before us- a rather dilapidated structure, painted in recent years, with an agraharam of sorts lining the street- elaborate, empty and lifeless. No living being seemed to be in the general vicinity except us.</p>
<p>Kamal started with his handy cam, and all of us 'armed' our cameras:-). Mel Kadambur had a good-sized temple (nothing huge)- with pragaarams and a few sculptures- but on the whole, it was a rather simple structure. The garba griham was not open- a localite appeared and told us that poojai was over by 10 AM. He then favored us with a 'thala varalaaru' of &#145;Amirthakadeswarar' and 'Vithyu Jothi Nayaki', and about the 'Kadamba maram' -the 'thala virutcham'. We took a few snaps, and made our way back to the van, on our way to Keezh Kadambur, about a km from Mel Kadambur.</p>
<p>We stopped at an intersection that was little more than an 'othaiyadi pathai'- the van could go no further. We walked along the shrubbery (with curious villagers peeping out of their huts). The road suddenly widened out into a clearing. A gatepost stood in a corner, devoid of any gates- and there, standing forlornly in the middle of the clearing, were the ruins of what must have been a fair-sized temple- the "Rudrakodeeshwarar" temple of Keezh Kadambur. Fields and thorny fences dotted the area. Localites informed us that a few people had come there a couple of days ago and done a general cleaning up because someone was visiting there- whom, we didn&#146;t know.</p>
<p>The lingam was standing right in front of the temple- the garba griham (which was all that was left of the temple) had fallen in. Stones and pillars had fallen all around the places, and the area had a look of destruction. One got the feeling that something had &#145;gone wrong&#146; there&#133;there was a distinct aura of destruction - and yes, something like&#133;sorrow. (&#147;Mayaana boomi maathiri irukku...- Sathya) A lot of discussion went on about what part this place could have played in the Aditha Karikalan murder.</p>
<p>&#147;Raja raja Chozhan set up a commission of enquiry to clear up Aditha Karikalan&#146;s murder,&#148; explained Mr. Vishwaksenan. &#147;He did it as soon as he ascended the throne. Ravidasan and his group had done it- and everyone was pretty sure that the Sambuvaraiyars had a hand in it too. After all, the murder of a crown prince could hardly have been done without some support from the chieftains of the area. What no one had was proof of their involvement. As soon as news of their probable &#145;sathi&#146; leaked out, the people rose up in protest. They did what the government couldn&#146;t do- destroyed the temple, wrecked the countryside and generally created havoc. This is probably the remains of what happened then..."</p>
<p>We gave a last glance at the clearing and retraced our steps back to the van.</p>
<p>Our next stop was Udaiyaarkudi - another temple with a good deal of historical interest. We arrived there about 11.30 AM, after retracing our steps from Kadambur- and we were so famished that we decided on a food-break. Brunch (a combo of lunch and breakfast, which we missed) was at Hotel Selva's. By 12.15, we were finished. With the sun on our heads, we walked around the temple, which were undergoing repairs (most temples seemed to). It was quite deserted, and we spent a pleasant few minutes walking around the place, admiring the sculptures. I guess, in comparison with the Periya Koil and other renowned spots, these smaller temples looked rather faded. Worse, they had been painted over so completely and thoroughly( 'Asian' paintings, as Mr. Vijayakumar remarked:-) that one couldn't make out the original features at all. For all that, we managed to see plenty.</p>
<p>Udaiyaarkudi, for instance, is the site of the most startling inscription-one that condemns Ravidasan, his brother Parameswaran, and other conspirators, their families, those who married into them, the whole set-up, in fact, to an exile outside Chozha Nadu. The inscription says 'Throgigalaanaa...Ravidasan...' and that sparked off a whole new thread. Throgigal. If RD and the rest of the caboodle had been Pandiya naattu aabathuthavigal, wouldn't they have been named as such? Why call them betrayers at all? Could there possibly be something behind that? One particular theory is that Ravidasan and Co., weren't Pandiyan citizens at all, but were part of the Chozha regime itself. Apparently, they had been assigned by 'someone inside' to put away the crown prince...it appears, however, that Raja raja Chozhan couldn't find enough evidence to support it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the 'kalvettu' that bears this inscription is so chock-full of paint that we almost raved in desperation:-) What wouldn't we have done to read a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym , just a tiny <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of those revolutionary words? No amount of scraping over the stone, or feeling our fingers along it could define them. It seems the writer Balakumaran went through the same fit of desperation. One part of the inscription was clearer than the rest- the paint had been rubbed off. The archagar remarked that the writer had painstakingly scraped off the paint over the inscription himself. In the end, we had to content ourselves with photographing it.</p>
<p>We got an unexpected bonus here- the archagar provided us with excellent, enchanting music. We were standing in the garba griham, waiting for the deepaaraathanai, when a voice rose suddenly, singing His praises. In the dark, confined room, it sounded pure and unearthly. There was complete silence for a while after he finished. It was only after he appeared with the vibuthi did we shake ourselves out of the trance.</p>
<p>On one side there was the lake sloping downwards, on the other side the land itself dipped sharply. The van lurched forwards and backwards, all of us hanging on for dear life. We were wondering if our wish to see the lake had been granted in a peculiar fashion by the Gods- by dipping us headfirst into the lake, and affording us a 'different' view! But our therotti proved to be an expert. We wrenched away from the road, towards the temple.</p>
<p>Veera naarayanpuram Koil proved to be an interesting place-in another respect. When we entered, there was a 'Panchayathu' going on, very seriously. It was a pity we couldn't stay and listen to the meeting agenda, but from the way everybody was squatting around, we felt sure that it was something quite serious (just like the films!). We wandered around, gazing at the inside of the temple, spent some time and finally made our exit.</p>
<p>A journey of 25 Kms saw us to Gangaikonda Chozhapuram- the hallmark of Rajendra Chozha I. It was 2.45 when we went there- the temple wasn't open for the poojai yet. They say that the Thanjai Periya Koil is masculine in appearance, whereas <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  is feminine- smaller in size, and more delicate in features. (Someone even remarked that the temple was smaller than the Tanjore one because Rajendra Chola didn't want to build a temple that might outshine his father's). The grounds of <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  are beautiful- well maintained, green lawns and clear-cut stone sculptures. The Nataraja sculpture in the left part of the gopuram was particularly beautiful- the features were so precise, lifelike and pleasant. The smile alone would have won a beauty paegant. The Nandi also is a sight to see. Since the garbagriham would be open only by 4PM, we decided to spend time wandering about the lawns, which is what we did. We must have taken a dozen photos over there- especially the Singa-muga enclosure, which led to<br />the temple well. By 4.30, we were ready to start on our way to another landmark in the Ponniyin Selvan magnum opus- the Pazhuvur Temples.</acronym></p>
<p>Our next stop was at Pazhuvur, 40 kms from <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym . It was quite pleasant, rolling over the uneven roads, enjoying the countryside in the fading sunlight. We'd almost crossed Pazhuvur before we realized it. Keezh Pazhuvur possesses a temple, but what we really wanted to see was at Mel Pazhuvur, the Avani Gandharpa Easwaram (mentioned by Gokul)- built by the great Pazhuvettaraiyars at the height of their powers. The name board specified 'Mannu Perum Pazhuvur" right in front of a grayish-black, desolate structure- it was the board that drew our attention first. Everyone tumbled out with their camera paraphernalia and stood around, exclaiming.</p>
<p>"Hey, this is it!"</p>
<p>"Ithuthaanaa athu?!"</p>
<p>"Ithuvaa Pazhuvur?"</p>
<p>It turned out to be the long-lost Pazhuvur-but alas! the temple was locked. The archagar arrived on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays- that day was Friday, but he hadn't come yet. It was already 6 PM and the light was fading fast. The local Pazhuvur population gathered at the tea-stall with interest, watching this group of excited (crazy?) tourists. One small group put forth the daring idea that they would bring a ladder, we could then climb it and jump into the temple complex.</p>
<p>Fortunately, before this could be carried out, someone appeared with the keys. A yell went up, and all of us surged up to the temple. The door opened slowly with a huge 'creak'- and we entered, to find the place full of rat/bat/ and God knew what else droppings.</p>
<p>The temple itself was a beautiful place. There were two 'karkoilkal' within the complex- the entrance to the first one was so small that we had to bend double to get in. Inside, the stone walls showed signs of disintegration. The musty corridor led straight to the Garbagriham, which had a solitary lingam inside it. Two pathways led outside- the second sannithi was in similar condition. There was another sannithi, which held a deity- by this time it was so dark that nothing much could be made out. The general temple structure, though, gave us plenty of clues as to how appealing it must have been in earlier days. There was an aura of serenity about it- everything was simple and peaceful. We walked around the uneven stone paths one last time, and closed the door with regret. Later, everyone voted the temple the best they'd seen so far.("ithuthaan enakku rombap pidicha koil"- Krupashankar)</p>
<p>We passed through Keezh Pazhuvur with a peek from the outside- night had fallen, and we had to get to Thirumazhapaadi. We reached there by 7.30 PM. Mr. SR suggested we look in at the Kollidam that flowed on the opposite side of the road to the temple- and we promptly set off.</p>
<p>That hour was probably one of the best in the trip. The moon was a small sliver in the sky, and faded starlight reached down to the earth. The water was flowing at the bottom of a stretch of sand, and it all seemed unearthly and very beautiful. Some of us sat down, while others stepped down into the water (which really is sweet:-). (Kamal tried to capture the scene in his Handy cam -eventually it turned out to be a few light shapes moving in the night- suspiciously like the ghosts of Kodikarai:-). A fresh breeze sprung up, and we could hardly tear ourselves away from it. It was heavenly.</p>
<p>The Thirumazhapaadi Koil was the inspiration for the famous pathigam "Ponnaar Meniyane...". It's a large complex, fully worthy of all its praises. Night, however, made it slightly difficult to appreciate it. Still, we could admire the vast corridors, the tiers of stone corridors, the evenness of the sculptures...and then it was time to leave. 10kms travel brought us to Thiruvaiyaaru- the place Vandiyathevan enters at the end of the fifth paagam after numerous travails.</p>
<p>Thiruvaiyaaru is on the opposite shore to Thirumazhapaadi (we had seen its lights on the banks of Kollidam)- and it is an enormous complex. Aiyaarappar (Panchanatheeswarar, so named because 5 rivers join here) and Aram valartha naayaki (Dharma samvarthini) rule here- and their home is truly wonderful. We examined the Navagrahas (which all face Lord Surya in this particular temple), and talked over the precision of the typically structured architecture, the dimensions of the enormous complex, the huge, sprawling open-aired corridors (which must have been the site of God knew how many community gatherings in the past). This was where the saint Appar had his Dharisanam of Lord Shiva and his consort too. By 9, we reluctantly took our leave.</p>
<p>A further drive brought us to Thanjavoor- to the Oriental Towers (which was gleaming with chandeliers and sofas- our first instinct was that we'd come to the wrong place:-). We'd finished dinner at Hotel Aravind and we checked in by 10 PM. Then, Kamal showed us the day's travels on his Handycam and with that, Day 1 of the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  trip came to an end.</p>
<p>Day 2 (Saturday, February 8th)</p>
<p>Day 2 started in a more leisurely way than Day 1- we started at 7.30, finished breakfast, and set off on our way to the Periya Koil, the first on our agenda. The Periya Koil, as many people have talked about in many different ways, is a masterpiece. Built by the hero of our story, its size, structure, its dazzling dimensions have earned it a place in World Heritage. What more can one say? In side the temple complex, we split up. Half of us went wandering around the enormous corridors that surround the temple, some of us ambled over to the Nandi. Mr.Vishwaksenan disappeared to hunt out the Kalki agent for that area, and they appeared in a few minutes, right in the middle of a discussion about the temple. </p>
<p>Mr. Balakumaran had said in his tape that the so-called 'single stone' at the head of the vimanam wasn't a single stone at all, but was made of many stones set very close together ("...aaranju chulai maathiri... :). And with luck, the temple authorities agreed to open up the first level of the temple- a part, which is generally closed to the public and which, requires special admission if one has to see it. All of us trooped up the stone steps up to the first level. They led upto a terrace, with the gopuram rising to our left. The Kalki agent led us to the doorway and unlocked it. </p>
<p>We stepped inside a dark corridor, which ran to our left and right, and vanished into darkness. Another set of steps led to a doorway, which looked onto a chamber over the garba griham. It was barred at one end (because we mustn&#146;t stand right on top of the garba griham)- and then the spotlights were switched on. We raised our heads and looked straight up to the top of the gopuram. The hollow structure spiraled into the darkness right up to the very top. It was a magnificent architectural feat. How they ever managed to do this so many thousands of years ago is simply amazing... </p>
<p>Outside, the dark corridor was lit up, and we could see sculptures detailing the various dance poses of Lord Nataraja. The panel above the sculptures was filled with vague colors and outlines. These, we learnt, were paintings showing King Raja raja and his consorts, and other scenes. Almost nothing remained of them. The dance poses, on the other hand, were minute- each one of them was exquisitely detailed. (Dancer Padma Subramanian once visited this place, it seems, and did some serious research for a whole fortnight). Some of the dance poses weren't completed- blocks of stone, chiseled and ready for sculpting, had been left empty- they seemed to be waiting for the hands of a great sculptor to touch them, who would shake them out of their sleep and convert them into gleaming figurines... This chamber containing the dance panels, with its dark corridor running 'inside' the gopuram is quite an architectural feat in itself. Its walls, rising upwards, broaden gradually to meet the outer<br />gopuram at the top. Magnificent. After another bout of photographs, we descended to the ground (literally and imaginatively:-), and began a walking tour of the corridors that surround the temple. </p>
<p>The paintings on the walls had been disfigured (by 'English' kalvettus, as someone quipped)- but for all that, their beauty was not impaired. One could only marvel at the vision of Raja raja, not just his ambition to produce one of the greatest temples in South India, but his magnanimity in acknowledging the fact that other people (his wives, and those who had contributed wealth and effort in building the temple) had put in valuable effort in completing the temple.</p>
<p>"...Shri Raajaraajeeswaram udaiyaarkku naan kuduthanavum akkan kudduthanavum nam pendugal kuduthanavum matrum kuduthaar kuduthanavum..." </p>
<p>After all, he could just have said that he built the temple, and left it at that. Who would have dared to oppose him? (Seems he was taking a bath in the Chozha Maligai in Thanjai, when he ordered etching inscriptions into stone:-) </p>
<p>After visiting the other sannithis and lounging about the lawns for a while, we left the temple reluctantly. It was 11 AM when we started towards Saraswathi Mahal (Periya Koil had made us stay an hour more than we had intended:-). Since we wanted to make good time to Kodikarai, we stayed in Saraswathi Mahal just long enough to take a sweeping look at it- not more than half an hour. (What we looked through included the Maratha dresses, weapons, kitchen utensils and other odds and ends. I especially liked the 'thengai thuruvi':-) </p>
<p>One of the guardian angels of Thanjavur, the 'Nisumba Sudhani' (described by Balakumaran in his tape as quite a hideous entity) was on our agenda- the temple still exists, but is known as the 'Vada Badhra kaali (info- Mr. Sunder Bharadwaj) temple. Since it was nearing twelve, we decided to skip it. Lunch was finished quickly in Thanjai, and we set off at 1.30 PM - to Point Calimere. </p>
<p>We reached Kodiakarai by 5 PM ( around 100 Kms). The roads were not too bad, we made good time, really (Passing the 'Raamar Paadham' on the way, and uppalams, signaling the approach of the sea). Our first stop, naturally, was the Kuzhagar Koil. A big, graceful structure with graying walls loomed up in front of us with a high mathil suvar. Kodikarai proper was 4 kms from the Koil. (Apparently, Poonghuzhali jumped down from the mathil and sprinted all the 4kms to the beach. Quite in keeping with her character!) We took a tour of the temple, which stood majestically, with a few huts at the side. Thankfully, this was not quite so dilapidated as some others (probably due to the thiruppani that seems to have been done- in 1940s) were. </p>
<p>There were some obvious additions- the brick-paved floor, for example. The sculptures surrounding the sannithi were in good condition too. And this is where we took the photo of the combination lock (which Krupashankar has posted in his web site - the one where the archagar is holding it like an <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan" AK </acronym 47:-).</p>
<p>Kamal decided to show off his driving abilities by rushing the van at us:-)- and we took some photos here too. The approach road to the temple is well paved and the whole area is neat and tidy (in spite of scrubby bushes abounding all over the place)-obviously, it has been re-furbished since Kalki's times. Kuzhagar is no longer all that alone. </p>
<p>At 5.30 PM, we started towards the beach- and it proved to be the best evening in the trip:-) We stopped at the forest department's place first- we needed special permission to get to the beach. After suitably arranging matters, we took off. (The beach brought on talk about the trip to Sri Lanka). The road ran through the village and entered scrubland. After a while we came to a gate, after passing which, we entered the real Kodiakarai- described by Kalki. Thorny shrubs grew in clumps all over the vast, flatland, stretching away into the horizon. Deer, grazing patiently, threw startled glances at our approach, and gamboled into the shrubbery (just as Poonghuzhali saw them). Some of them suddenly jumped high in the air- we wondered if there were any 'puthai kuzhis' there. The ground seemed firm in most places, and slightly muddled in others. The mud road meandered through more shrubs, some growing so thickly that there were a few possible sites for the 'maraindha mandapam' :-),<br />twisting and turning. A few cows strayed about lazily. </p>
<p>Finally, a few minutes later, the sea appeared- little waves flowing gently to the shore, and the blue waters fading into the horizon- exactly as in 'Ponniyin Selvan'. One could easily picture Vandhiyathevan trying to wash himself in the sea, desperate to get himself clean:-). There was a lonely brick structure right on the beach- the remains of some long gone lighthouse of some bygone era, perhaps. There was a curious hole in it- probably a window embrasure, and we all took turns, sticking our heads through it :-) The setting sun threw its slanting rays through the 'window', and the seashore was converted into an idyllic spot, stretching away on all sides. It was completely empty-except for us. Our first instinct was to get into the sea, which we did. Krupashankar and Kamal emulated a Veera Saivan and Vaishnavan-both had their hands on the other's neck- and the former promptly sat down in the water (which was splendidly cool after the hot drive). We spent an hour there, splashing<br />through the water to our heart's content. Almost everyone, I think, pictured Poonghuzhali and her Kolli-vai pisaasus there:-)- and indulged in a frantic photo-session. God knew what Krupashankar was trying to do in the sea- we suddenly heard agonized yells and looked back to see him scrabbling wildly after his slippers, which had floated away on the waves:-). </p>
<p>It was a delightful hour. The waves glinted in the last rays of the sun, and the marshland glowed in an unearthly light. Shadows fell everywhere, suddenly transforming the seashore into another world- one full of strange and beautiful entities. I for one fully expected Ravidasan to emerge out of the sand dunes :-) And then, it was time to go. By 6.30 PM, a tired but exultant <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  crew marched to the van, full of sea-water, shells and loads of Kodikarai sand- only to be told sternly by our driver that he was not going to have his clean van soiled by us in all our sand and filth.</p>
<p>"enga venaa ukkarunga, Mela venumnaa ukkarunga, anaa ulle gille vanthu asingam panneenga..."</p>
<p>It was at that moment, I think, that we all went crazy :-) [Later, we were all pretty sure that Poonghuzhali's 'aavi', floating around the beaches of Kodikarai in spirit form, must have entered us all as suitable to carry out her wishes- nothing else would explain what we did :-)] One and all were hit by the same idea all at once. Kamal and Krupa darted towards the rear, followed by Sathya, me, Anuradha, Lavanya, Radhika and Viji- and before anyone knew what was happening, all of us had scrambled up the slim ladder to the top of the carrier! It was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of a squeeze on top, of course, with so many people- but that added to the general delight. All the elders kept telling us that we were bound to fall off, that we'd have a tough time making it to the vilage in one piece- and all their words fell on deaf ears. </p>
<p>We were determined on a 'crazy African Safari' (as Mr. Sharma put it), and nothing would stop us. The van driver gave up his efforts to get us down, and started his vehicle, which gave a lurch and nearly upset some of us :-) And then started a weird and wonderful ride through the marshes of Kodikarai- twilight had set in, the view from the top rolled away before our eyes in all directions for miles, the sky was streaked with the blues and pinks of sunset- in a word, it was superb. The van went slowly, but there were the unavoidable humps and bumps in the road, sending us all into yells whenever they happened. </p>
<p>Krupashankar proposed a contest to see who could stand up on the carrier, Lavanya was seized by a desire to sing 'Alai kadalum oynthirukka..." (which she did:-), and all of us were caught by the wonderful scenery. No deer were present, but we suddenly came upon a lone and solitary...wild black horse, gamboling in the flatlands! Of course, it must have been the horse ridden by the Oomai Rani:-). The original 'safari' was to have been until the gates of Kodikarai- but we voted to ride on until the village was reached. Sea birds flew overheard, darkness was closing in, the lighthouse started flashing (the only 'kolli-vai pisaasu' we could see) and the sea-wind rippled across us. All around us, bushes and shrubs waved along the road. </p>
<p>Some one from inside the van yelled to ask if we were all there on the roof, and how many of us had been bumped off. The van obligingly gave another lurch and set everyone screeching. All the animals and spirits must have heard us for miles around:-) Telephone wires began appearing, the mark of civlization- and then came the agonizing question- we had climbed up easily enough, would climbing down be that easy (especially Anuradha, -</p>
<p>"...naan nadakkum pothE thoppu thoppunnu vizhuven...":-)??? </p>
<p>But we managed it. (see Krupa's photos:-). All the elders promptly got off the van and stood around us, grinning and marking our 'progress' and commenting wildly on how we must get down, where we must place our feet and everything else. The locals gaped at this spectacular show. Finally, all our dust left on the carrier, we settled down in our wet clothes inside the van, playing 'Anthakshari' and generally fooling about. Night had fallen and Kodikarai was left behind. Kudanthai was the night halt, and when we reached it after three hours, and checked in Hotel Chela's, all of us were ready for our rest.</p>
<p>Day 3 (Sunday, February 9th):</p>
<p>On this, the last day of the trip, things were made easy by the fact that we had stopped over at Kudanthai (instead of Thanjavur, as originally planned)- so all the places in our itinerary could be reached quickly. Our first stop, Thirupurambayam (the site of the conspiracy of the Pandiya aabathuthavis) was a mere 4kms from the city proper. We'd decided to skip breakfast, so we could have more time to spend on temples.</p>
<p>By 10.30 AM, we had reached Thiruvalanchuzhi- which boasts of an elegant temple- and a ruined structure at a little distance from it, with just one sannithi (collapsing within itself) which contains inscriptions that contain the names of Panchavan Maadhevi (Raja raja's fifth wife), and Maathevadigal (his daughter). We mulled over this for some time, it put forth-new ideas. The whole place, which can be accessed through a gap in the compound wall of the main temple, is overgrown with shrubbery and trees- it looks like the site of an ancient Maya excavation. After some photos, we moved to the main temple. Krupashankar, Sathya and Lavanya went haring off towards a small room that was built in a corner of the complex. The whole path that led to the section was filled with thorns, and they ended up doing a hop, skip and jump dance on the ground (accompanied by grinning comments from those of us who stood outside:-). They had barely started staggering on their way back when someone<br />assailed us with the speed of a whirlwind and welcomed us all heartily, with a booming voice.</p>
<p>This was Mr. Sundar Bharadwaj(Mr. Balakumaran's friend), the expert who'd helped us draft our route map and is a veritable mine of information on Chozhas. He and his companian had come on an errand of their own, and had run into us (he'd hoped he would:-) (He was also the person I referred to right at the beginning, as the one who gave us the inba athirchi :-)</p>
<p>Mr. Sundar Bharadwaj's (henceforth SB) enthusiasm quickly infected all of us. In one whirlwind tour, he explained to us about the beauty of the 'kodungais' -curving stone edges that decorated the roof of the sannithis (the best are at Aavudaiyaar Koil- it seems that in those days they used to ask for kodungais sculpted like the ones in Aavudaiyaar Koil). The 'kal palagani' (the stone grill) for it is very intricately wrought and well finished and a small panel right on top of one of the doorways to the sannithi, which shows an interesting scene. SB said that it depicted Raja <br />raja and Karuvoor Thevar sitting at the feet of Lord Shiva (which again, seemed to imply that Raja raja had died by the time this panel was finished).</p>
<p>SB next showed the temple kulam a figurine was etched there, with hands folded and inscriptions dotted the stones.(He gave us a good deal of information that caused a lot of discussion). We left at 11.30 AM, for the Panchavan Maathevi Pallipadai, built by Rajendra Chozhan in memory of his father's fifth wife. Less than a couple of kilo meters from Thiruvalanchuzhi, this huge, imposing structure can be reached by a short walk through a small mud-track, As soon as you come into the clearing a ruined, half-fallen brown structure meets you, covered by vines and creepers.</p>
<p>SB has really spent enormous time and energy over the Chozhas- listening to his words, we could actually go back to the era of the Chozhas, their lives, their trials, tribulations. One could actually feel the feet of the emperors who had walked about in this half-ruined pallipadai and paid their respects to this favored queen of Raja raja. We could make out a few words among the inscriptions in the stone, particularly the name of the queen- but that was about all. By this time, time was running out, so we bid a hasty good-bye and continued on our way.</p>
<p>We stopped next at a vast field, with a banyan tree and others standing in a group at on end. This, said SB, was the site of the old Pazhaiyaarai aranmanai, once populated by the Chozha royalty. We could find a few 'ottanchillus' if we burrowed around, he said. ("...intha idathukku vantheengannaa, inga yaaro irunthirukkaa, yaaro innum irakkaannu nannaa theriyum..."- Balakumaran). After a last lingering look at the empty field, the only relic of royalty, we were on our way next- to Patteeswaram.</p>
<p>Patteeswaram, as most people know, is a place teeming with the local population. Its a well-known temple- and there, we learnt a great deal from the archagar who is a mine of information himself. The Durgaiyamman reigning as the deity was originally the guardian deity of the pazhaiyaarai palace, and the Shanmugar and Bhairava deities were there too. He explained us a good deal about the hairstyles and dress codes of the past- remarking how the fashion repeats itself:-)</p>
<p>We spent some time there, where SB gave us a HUGE garland of lemons (that he'd bought for worship) and an assortment of key chains (as mementos, he said:-). Our next stop was the Nandipura Vinnagaram. The temple's garba griham was not open (it was after 12 PM, when we went)- so we took a swift look at Lord Jagannaathar and went to the Paalkulathamman Koil.</p>
<p>This temple has quite a history in itself. The temple itself stands by the road, painted in today's garish colors. On one's first approach to the temple, the pillar to the right holds great significance. This pillar, it seems, is the only remaining witness to have seen Raja raja Chozhan at his death- it was part of the mandapam in which the great emperor's body was laid. Due to some reason, the mandapam was demolished- and eventually, Rajendra Chozhan's thalapathi underwent a viratham, uprooted the pillar which was undamaged, and established it in the Paalkulathamman Koil. It still stands, painted a pinkish shade, a silent witness to a thousand years of history.</p>
<p>By this time, it was noon, and a lunch was in order. SB escorted us to his favorite haunt, Maami's mess (Kudanthai), where we were served a delicious lunch in a homely atmosphere. After a brief rest at the hotel, we started again. Our next stop was Darasuram (here's how it came by its current name: originally called Rajarajeswaram- Rajarajapuram-Rarapuram-Darasuram).</p>
<p>Words cannot describe the beauty of Darasuram. One will have to invent a whole new language to do justice to that beautiful temple. The huge dimensions of the temple, its corridors stretching away, the chariot-shaped structure pulled by exquisitely carved horses and its intricate panels. <br />Depicting the Meenakshi Kalyaanam in one, scenes from the Ramayana in the other, the five distinctly carved stone windows, each of a different design, a scene showing Sundarar pulling a devotee's son out of a crocodile, a match-box sized Pillaiyaar, steps which produce musical notes, the list is endless. A precisely carved 'Lingothpavar' decorates the back of the vimanam, and the distinctly carved Lord Shiva with three heads and eight hands is said to be found nowhere else in India.</p>
<p>We were breathless when we left the main temple to visit the next one, the Amman Koil. This was slightly smaller, and rather less complicated, but it held its share of treasures, nevertheless. A few photos here and we were off to Nachiyaar Koil. Famous for its Kal garudan, this temple ascends in a series of steps, until one sees the deity. By this time, we were beginning to be rushed for time, so we did a quick tour, and were soon on our way to Ammankudi.</p>
<p>Ammankudi is supposedly the birthplace of Krishnan Raaman, the famed second in command of Rajendra Chozhan. The temple is nothing like the temples we'd seen earlier in the day- its been white-washed, painted, and now stands as a typically 'modern' temple- devoid of any special characteristics. We searched around for a sculpture of Raja raja- but couldn't find it.</p>
<p>Last on our agenda, at 6.30 PM, we started for Konerirajapuram (originally called Thirunallam, this is where Vanathi first meets young Arulmozhi- he valiantly rescues a nest of birds by arriving on an elephant:-). This temple is built on fairly large dimensions, and we spent a considerable amount of time admiring the exquisite bronze of Lord Nataraja. Night had fallen by <br />this time, and we made another quick tour of the temple. Chembiyan Maadevi was depicted on one of the panels, paying her respect to the deity. (These were in the dark, we couldn't have seen them if someone hadn't obliged us by handing us a light).</p>
<p>By 8 PM, Thirunallam had been seen. We climbed into the bus, and started on our journey back home. We had A late dinner at 10 PM. The whole night was spent in sharing memories of what we'd seen, what we could see next- and many, many more things. At 3.45 AM the next morning, we'd reached the outskirts of Chennai. Everyone got off at their homes- and thus ended our <br />momentous tour of Ponniyin Selvan's 'Kathaikkalam'.</p>
<p>Many things made our trip memorable. The fact that we were all bound by one excellent work, the fact that we shared the same wavelength that we could discuss <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  without being obliged to explain what we were talking about every single line. For example, if you suddenly lapsed into SenThamizh, nobody would look at you as if you'd gone crazy:-). These were subtle things- not <br />easily visible to a lay person- but so easily seen by people who share a love for Kalki and his magnum opus.</acronym></p>
