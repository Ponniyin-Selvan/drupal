</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>I had written earlier about Vandihyathevan but in the light of newer <br />knowledge acquired in the past years I thought I could revisit this <br />lovable hero of Ponniyin selvan (<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ).</p>
<p>Let us spend some time on who this vallavariyan was. It is highly <br />unlikely that the actual marriage between kundavai and vandiyathevan <br />(<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym  henceforth) was such a romantic affair as portrayed in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym . <br />Almost every single marriage in chola family was a political affair <br />and not a love affair. Even today most marriages in political <br />families are calculated arrangements - we all see that.</acronym></p>
<p>In chola days marriages were meant to strengthen the relationship <br />between feudatories and the king so that they gained more attachment <br />towards the central power of authority. This arrangement worked very <br />well in the times of cholas. And it is absolutely surprising that <br />even the chera - chola - pandiya kings - the so called sworn <br />enemies - had the habit of marrying from each other's family. <br />Aditya's marriage of a kerala princess (Chera Stanu ravi and Aditya <br />I were close friends) - Parantaka I's Devi Malliswarathu <br />nampirattiyar TENNAVAN mahadeviyar (pandiyan princess) (ref ARE 44 <br />of 1895) are all examples of this practice.</p>
<p>Being the daughter of a powerful king, kundavai was given in <br />marriage to a RASHTRAKUTA PRINCE or someone belonging to that family <br />and this fellow was vandhiyathevan !! ARE 14 of 1920 bears solid <br />testimony to this fact. It talks about a lamp stand donation of a <br />queen called Ilango Pichchi, daughter of VALLAVARAIYAR and a senior <br />queen of solap perumanadigal. In Epigraphica india Vol XXVI page <br />233, this vallavaraiyar has been identified with Rashtrakuta king <br />Krishna II.</p>
<p>Thus there was a close political nexus and the practice of marrying <br />rashtrakuta family members within the chola family. Though <br />rashtrakutas were not that powerful during rajaraja's times it <br />should have been with a purpose that kundavai married <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan" VD</acronym .</p>
<p>And what was that ?</p>

<p>              In fact Panchavanmadevi was came to picture while RR <br />in <br />    power <br />        or <br />            atmost he about to take the power, but the real support <br />was <br />        given <br />          by <br />            kundavai to RR , while he lives in his hard 15 yrs.</p>

<p>              Let us spend some time on who this vallavariyan was. <br />It <br />  is <br />        highly <br />              unlikely that the actual marriage between kundavai and <br />            vandiyathevan <br />              (VD henceforth) was such a romantic affair as <br />portrayed <br />  in <br />      PS. <br />              Almost every single marriage in chola family was a <br />    political <br />            affair <br />              and not a love affair. Even today most marriages in <br />    political <br />              families are calculated arrangements - we all see that.</p>
<p>              In chola days marriages were meant to strengthen the <br />        relationship <br />              between feudatories and the king so that they gained <br />more <br />            attachment <br />              towards the central power of authority. This <br />arrangement <br />        worked <br />            very <br />              well in the times of cholas. And it is absolutely <br />    surprising <br />        that <br />              even the chera - chola - pandiya kings - the so called <br />    sworn <br />              enemies - had the habit of marrying from each other's <br />      family. <br />              Aditya's marriage of a kerala princess (Chera Stanu <br />ravi <br />    and <br />            Aditya <br />              I were close friends) - Parantaka I's Devi <br />Malliswarathu <br />              nampirattiyar TENNAVAN mahadeviyar (pandiyan princess) <br />    (ref <br />        ARE <br />          44 <br />              of 1895) are all examples of this practice.</p>
<p>              Being the daughter of a powerful king, kundavai was <br />given <br />    in <br />              marriage to a RASHTRAKUTA PRINCE or someone belonging <br />to <br />    that <br />            family <br />              and this fellow was vandhiyathevan !! ARE 14 of 1920 <br />  bears <br />        solid <br />              testimony to this fact. It talks about a lamp stand <br />    donation <br />        of a <br />              queen called Ilango Pichchi, daughter of VALLAVARAIYAR <br />  and <br />    a <br />            senior <br />              queen of solap perumanadigal. In Epigraphica india Vol <br />    XXVI <br />        page <br />              233, this vallavaraiyar has been identified with <br />    Rashtrakuta <br />        king <br />              Krishna II.</p>
<p>              Thus there was a close political nexus and the <br />practice <br />  of <br />            marrying <br />              rashtrakuta family members within the chola family. <br />  Though <br />              rashtrakutas were not that powerful during rajaraja's <br />    times <br />      it <br />              should have been with a purpose that kundavai married <br />VD.</p>
<p>              And what was that ?</p>

<p>            Nice 2 read good subject , i was thinking , if "Panchavan <br />      Madevi <br />          has been honoured by Pallipadi means why not Kundavi, <br />  Kundavi's <br />          working towards cholas is sure much more better than what <br />          panchavanamadevi has did.</p>
<p>            In fact Panchavanmadevi was came to picture while RR in <br />  power <br />      or <br />          atmost he about to take the power, but the real support was <br />      given <br />        by <br />          kundavai to RR , while he lives in his hard 15 yrs.</p>

<p>            Let us spend some time on who this vallavariyan was. It <br />is <br />      highly <br />            unlikely that the actual marriage between kundavai and <br />          vandiyathevan <br />            (VD henceforth) was such a romantic affair as portrayed <br />in <br />    PS. <br />            Almost every single marriage in chola family was a <br />  political <br />          affair <br />            and not a love affair. Even today most marriages in <br />  political <br />            families are calculated arrangements - we all see that.</p>
<p>            In chola days marriages were meant to strengthen the <br />      relationship <br />            between feudatories and the king so that they gained more <br />          attachment <br />            towards the central power of authority. This arrangement <br />      worked <br />          very <br />            well in the times of cholas. And it is absolutely <br />  surprising <br />      that <br />            even the chera - chola - pandiya kings - the so called <br />  sworn <br />            enemies - had the habit of marrying from each other's <br />    family. <br />            Aditya's marriage of a kerala princess (Chera Stanu ravi <br />  and <br />          Aditya <br />            I were close friends) - Parantaka I's Devi Malliswarathu <br />            nampirattiyar TENNAVAN mahadeviyar (pandiyan princess) <br />  (ref <br />      ARE <br />        44 <br />            of 1895) are all examples of this practice.</p>
<p>            Being the daughter of a powerful king, kundavai was given <br />  in <br />            marriage to a RASHTRAKUTA PRINCE or someone belonging to <br />  that <br />          family <br />            and this fellow was vandhiyathevan !! ARE 14 of 1920 <br />bears <br />      solid <br />            testimony to this fact. It talks about a lamp stand <br />  donation <br />      of a <br />            queen called Ilango Pichchi, daughter of VALLAVARAIYAR <br />and <br />  a <br />          senior <br />            queen of solap perumanadigal. In Epigraphica india Vol <br />  XXVI <br />      page <br />            233, this vallavaraiyar has been identified with <br />  Rashtrakuta <br />      king <br />            Krishna II.</p>
<p>            Thus there was a close political nexus and the practice <br />of <br />          marrying <br />            rashtrakuta family members within the chola family. <br />Though <br />            rashtrakutas were not that powerful during rajaraja's <br />  times <br />    it <br />            should have been with a purpose that kundavai married VD.</p>
<p>            And what was that ?</p>

<p>    Pandyas, have marital relationship with Pandavas. Chitrangadhai <br />is <br />    belived to be Daugther of Malayadhwija Panyan. This Pandian also <br />    participated in Kuruksjetra war and was killed by Karna, after a <br />    Valiant battle. Where Karna mentions, this Pandya is capable of <br />    destroying entire Kauravas, and hence he should be killed first.</p>
<p>    Ganapereyil Kadantha Ukkiraperuvazhuthi, is belived not to have <br />    ruled out of Madurai, when he waged a victorious war against <br />Vengai <br />    MArban of Ganapereyil (Kaalayaarkoil).</p>

<p>        Let us spend some time on who this vallavariyan was. It is <br />  highly <br />        unlikely that the actual marriage between kundavai and <br />      vandiyathevan <br />        (VD henceforth) was such a romantic affair as portrayed in <br />PS. <br />        Almost every single marriage in chola family was a political <br />      affair <br />        and not a love affair. Even today most marriages in political <br />        families are calculated arrangements - we all see that.</p>
<p>        In chola days marriages were meant to strengthen the <br />  relationship <br />        between feudatories and the king so that they gained more <br />      attachment <br />        towards the central power of authority. This arrangement <br />  worked <br />      very <br />        well in the times of cholas. And it is absolutely surprising <br />  that <br />        even the chera - chola - pandiya kings - the so called sworn <br />        enemies - had the habit of marrying from each other's <br />family. <br />        Aditya's marriage of a kerala princess (Chera Stanu ravi and <br />      Aditya <br />        I were close friends) - Parantaka I's Devi Malliswarathu <br />        nampirattiyar TENNAVAN mahadeviyar (pandiyan princess) (ref <br />  ARE <br />    44 <br />        of 1895) are all examples of this practice.</p>
<p>        Being the daughter of a powerful king, kundavai was given in <br />        marriage to a RASHTRAKUTA PRINCE or someone belonging to that <br />      family <br />        and this fellow was vandhiyathevan !! ARE 14 of 1920 bears <br />  solid <br />        testimony to this fact. It talks about a lamp stand donation <br />  of a <br />        queen called Ilango Pichchi, daughter of VALLAVARAIYAR and a <br />      senior <br />        queen of solap perumanadigal. In Epigraphica india Vol XXVI <br />  page <br />        233, this vallavaraiyar has been identified with Rashtrakuta <br />  king <br />        Krishna II.</p>
<p>        Thus there was a close political nexus and the practice of <br />      marrying <br />        rashtrakuta family members within the chola family. Though <br />        rashtrakutas were not that powerful during rajaraja's times <br />it <br />        should have been with a purpose that kundavai married VD.</p>
<p>        And what was that ?</p>

And it is absolutely surprising that <br />    even the chera - chola - pandiya kings - the so called sworn <br />    enemies - had the habit of marrying from each other's family. <br />    Aditya's marriage of a kerala princess (Chera Stanu ravi and <br />  Aditya <br />    I were close friends) - Parantaka I's Devi Malliswarathu <br />    nampirattiyar TENNAVAN mahadeviyar (pandiyan princess) (ref ARE <br />44 <br />    of 1895) are all examples of this practice.</p>
<p>    Being the daughter of a powerful king, kundavai was given in <br />    marriage to a RASHTRAKUTA PRINCE or someone belonging to that <br />  family <br />    and this fellow was vandhiyathevan !! ARE 14 of 1920 bears solid <br />    testimony to this fact. It talks about a lamp stand donation of a <br />    queen called Ilango Pichchi, daughter of VALLAVARAIYAR and a <br />  senior <br />    queen of solap perumanadigal. In Epigraphica india Vol XXVI page <br />    233, this vallavaraiyar has been identified with Rashtrakuta king <br />    Krishna II.</p>
<p>    Thus there was a close political nexus and the practice of <br />  marrying <br />    rashtrakuta family members within the chola family. Though <br />    rashtrakutas were not that powerful during rajaraja's times it <br />    should have been with a purpose that kundavai married VD.</p>
<p>    And what was that ?</p>

<p>  Let us spend some time on who this vallavariyan was.
