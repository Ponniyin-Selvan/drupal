<p>The history of the Gangas is a landmark in the<br />history of Orissa. The dynasty reached the<br />height of glory for its political achievements,<br />temple building activities, economic prosperity<br />and religious movements. The advent of the<br />imperial Ganga marked a great revival of the<br />Vaishnava cult in Orissa. Under the royal<br />patronage of the Ganga rulers the fame of<br />Purushottama Jagannatha reached the pinnacle<br />of glory. The cult of Vaishnavism took an<br />important form with the construction of a<br />temple for Lord Purushottama at the sea-shore<br />of Puri.<br />Anantavarman Chodagangadeva the<br />founder of the Ganga dynasty occupied Utkala<br />and shifted his capital from Kalinganagara to<br />Kataka. Anantavarman like his predecessor,<br />was a great devotee of Siva and assumed the<br />title Parama Mahesvara. But in the Korni<br />copper plate grant1 dated 1112 A.D. he changed<br />his attitude and appeared to demonstrate<br />religious universality by applying to himself<br />titles such as Parama-Mahesvara, Parama-<br />Vaishnava and Parama-Brahmanya. In the<br />Narasimha and Markanda temple inscriptions<br />of Chodaganga the name of Purushottama2 is<br />found to have been mentioned.</p>
<p>Many scholars have spoken of a<br />conversion of Chodagangadeva from Saivism<br />to Vaishnavism and thinks that due to the<br />influence of Ramanuja this conversion took<br />place. It was during his reign Ramanuja visited<br />his kingdom and stayed at Puri. The effect of<br />his visit was the change of the religious faith<br />of Chodaganga who became a Parama<br />Vaishnava.</p></sps10142004@...></p>

<p>Dear venketesh</p>
<p>I did some searches and found this interesting lecture delivered by<br />Sri. M.B. Srinivasa Iyengar, on 5th may 1908...( came out as a book <br />in 1910)</p>
<p>i am reproducing some relevant texts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Such a noble example of philanthrophy and unselfish devotion to duty </p></blockquote>
<p>is to be seen in the lyife of Ramanujacharya, whose birthday<br />festivities are being celebrated today all .over .India and<br />Burma, and wherever Vaishnava followers of Ramanuja,<br />bearing on their foreheads the three distinguishing perpendicular<br />marks of the community, are found. </p>
<p>In referring to a few principal features of his noble career of<br />usefulness, extending over a period of more than a.century,<br />(for he lived over and above the full period of the patriarchal<br />age of our ancestors., viz., one hundred and twenty<br />years) it may pertinently be asked what was there anything<br />special in this noble personage that calls forth that<br />pious and faithful devotion ofhis followers and the unstinted<br />admiration of the world, even after the lapse of nearly a<br />thousand years.</p>
<p>His Biography may be advantageously studied<br />with a view to elicit information regarding the following<br />principal points :<br />(i) His Special Mission to the. world.<br />(2) The History of the development of the powerful<br />Vaishnava -organisation that he consolidated for continuing<br />the moral and spiritual work after him down to. posterity<br />on altruistic lines<br />(3) His great message of peace and goodwill to mankind.<br />(4) His universal love of mankind, irrespective of<br />caste, creed or colour.<br />(5) His scientific exposition of the Vedantic doctrine<br />and plan of salvation in conformity with the traditional<br />teachings handed over from the time of sage Bodhayana,<br />and his successful reconciliation of apparently conflicting<br />Vedic texts of equal authority.<br />(6) His special reform in the temples on orthodox<br />lines.<br />(7) His unbounded sympathy with the masses specially<br />the Panchamas.<br />(8) His successful attempt at bringing to prominence<br />the EMOTIONAL ASPECT of the Vaishnava Faith, and thus<br />reviving the popular religion of the venerable Alvars(who<br />preceded him) by scientifically propogating the doctrine<br />of Love and absolute renunciation)according to the needs and frame <br />of mind of the devotee,</p>

<p>Value af Biographical Study : One of the most<br />interesting studies of literature in any language is the<br />Biography of great men. Those that are written with<br />scrupulous care for accuracy and truth will be still more<br />instructive and interesting. Such Biographies are found<br />in modern Literature ; those of former days have to be<br />studied with great caution, and with an eye for historical<br />research and accuracy, and with due respect for Truth and<br />Probabilities ; for, in these Biographical writings, mythology,<br />and sometimes, supernatural agency, do come into<br />play, giving rise to legendary tales introduced by later<br />writers, with a view to enhance the importance of the incidents<br />connected with the career of such saints or sages.<br />Very often the so-called "<br />pious frauds "^have also to be<br />therein detected ; hence these writings have to be gone<br />through with extreme care and with a great deal of unbiassed<br />critical acumen. Bearing the above remarks in<br />mind, the following works may be consulted with advantage,<br />with a view to find out the most important incidents<br />in the life of Ramanujacharya.</p>
<p>i. Sri Guru parampara Prabhavam (Glorious Lives of<br />the Ancient Acharyas) in Tamil prose, stayed<br />MANIPRAVALAM. Unfortunately, there are now two versions<br />of this, belonging to the "Tenkalai" and " Vadakalai<br />" sections of the Srivaishnavas (Southern and Northern<br />sections)<br />2. Praparnnamritam, in Sanskrit.<br />3. Vishistadvaita Catechism (by Pandit Bhashyachar<br />of the Theosophical Society, Adyar) in English.<br />4. Palanadai Vilakkan In Tamil<br />-prose.<br />5. Life of Ramanujacharya (by A. Govindacharlu,<br />Mysore) in English. _<br />6. Life of Ramanuja (by the late S. Rangacharlu,<br />Delta Superintendent, Rajamundry) in English*<br />life, which are borne out by facts, and regarding<br />which most of us are agreed, are noted below :<br />*<br />Subsequent to the delivery of this address, I had occasion to peruse<br />the following, which may also be read by the readers with much <br />advantage :<br />(1) Life and teachings of Ramanujncharya by C. R. Srinivasiangar<br />B.A, (R. Venkateswar &amp; Co, Madras.}<br />(2) A paper on Bamanuja, contributed to the "<br />Wednesday Review *<br />by Mr, S. Krishnasanai Jyengar M.A. Central College, Bangalore.</p>

<blockquote><p>As regards the date of the birth of Ramanujacharya,</p></blockquote>
<p>there has been no difference of opinion, unlike that<br />of Sri Sankaracharya, which is wrapped up in obscurity<br />even to this day. This is easily accounted for, since from<br />the earliest days of his earthly career, Ramanuja's contemporaries<br />and admirers began to associate the periods of the<br />incidents of his life with specific noble thoughts of some<br />significance. Hence the traditional date of Salivahana<br />Saka 939 (corresponding to 939 -j- 78= 1017 A.D.) has been<br />taken advantage of by his Biographers, and has accordingly<br />been made synonymous with the noble thought as if this year<br />was particularly designed by Providence for the spread of<br />REAL, KNOWLEDGE on earth through Ramanujacharya.<br />So also is the saka year<br />"<br />1059" corresponding to A. D,<br />1137, designated as the dharmo Nastah=<br />Law of the Lord lost to the world), when the earthly<br />career of Sri Ramanujacharyar closed. Hence these two<br />important dates became fixed in the ancient chronicles of<br />the land, and could not be changed.</p>

<p>  More research has to be done in this line to ascertain the number <br />of <br />  years when Ramanuja was in exile and hence who is Kirumi Kanda <br />  Chozhan.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>SPS Sir, </p>
<p>Some of the dates are not clearly mentioned in the History of <br />Ramanuja. So my reply may not be concluding. However I give all the <br />perspectives that I know on these.</p>
<blockquote><p>  1. Most revered Sage Ramnujar's birth year / Venue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Year 1017 AD, Chithirai Month, Thiruvadhirai Nakshathram. Location: <br />Sriperumbudur</p>
<blockquote><p>  2. Adoption to Vaishnavism</p></blockquote>
<p>No clear cut date is ascribed to this. It is only written that he <br />was so obsessed with Azhwars works, which actually lead him to <br />Vaishnavism in the present form. This could have happened when he <br />was 10 or 14 years old (hearsay). The date when he underwent the <br />SamAsrayaNam or dhIkshai, was after the demise of Alavandar and this <br />must have happened around 20 years of age. I will verify this and <br />get back.</p>
<blockquote><p>  3. Melkottai duration</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Not clear. The accounts vary from a "short" period to approximately <br />12 years. But does not say anything about the dates. However, the <br />accounts to say that he went to Melkote during the reign of Kirumi <br />Kanda Chozhan. If we identify this chozhan to be AdhiRajendran then <br />we know the times. But is it "short" or 12 years is an unsolved <br />dispute.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>  4. Srirangam Establishment period .. till attainment of <br />Paramapadham</p></blockquote>
<p>This started and was an on-going process after he took the Acharya <br />peetam in Srirangam. This could have been after 30 years of age. <br />Again I need to verify this. Will get back to you soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>  We have discussed almost Emperor Era - Chozhas &amp; Pandyas - wise <br />  inscriptions in Srirangam.</p>
<p>  Let us look at them also.</p>
<p>  Atleast in Pandyas inscriptions there could have been mentions.</p>
<p>  best regards / </p>
<p>  sps</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

        <p>SPS Sir,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delayed reply. 12th to 14th Century is again inferred <br />from the fact that, the Authors of these lived just after Ramanuja <br />to, before Manavala Mamunigal. Ramanuja's dates are 1017 to 1137 AD. <br />While Manavalamamunigal's dates are 1371 to.... I am not sure about <br />his final date. This, effectively puts these works between the 12th <br />and 14th Century. That is what I conveyed.</p>

          Non-random-Thoughts : Dasavatharam â Kamalâs 12th Avathar!        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Smt Deepa,</p>
<p>You are right here. But just remember that Desikar from Kanchi and <br />the main seat of the Acharyas was in Srirangam. And also, Desikar <br />takes his cue only from Ramanuja who was seated in Srirangam. So the <br />place from where they originated was just a coincidental example to <br />the origins of Thenkalai and Vadakalai.</p>
<p>And one more important point to remember is, of the 12 Azhwars, <br />atleast 4 were born in the Thondai Mandalam. </p>
<p>1. Poigai Azhwar in Kanchipuram (incidentally)<br />2. Boothathazhwar in Mahabalipuram <br />3. Peyazhwar in Mylapore<br />4. Thirumazhisai Azhwar in Thirumazhisai on the outskirts of Chennai.</p>
<p>All these Azhwars wandered from one place to another, so could not <br />be classified as belonging to a particular region, inspite of the <br />fact that they were born in North Tamizh Nadu.</p>
<p>That is why, Thenkalai Vadakalai, could not have come into force <br />just because of a locale, but because of a larger cultural <br />difference in which the "Then" in Thenkalai refers to entire Tamizh <br />speaking community and the "Vada" in Vadakalai referst to the <br />community which still had its affiliations to Sanskrit, which was <br />the main language in the northern part of India.</p>
<p>All these for Azhwars, while the doyen of the Vaishnavites, Ramanuja <br />himself was born in Sriperumbudur and studied in Kanchipuram, before <br />adorning the seat of Acharyas, which was always in Srirangam. One <br />cannot classify the sect based on the location. </p>
<p>Though it is commonly "believed" that Desikar propounded the <br />Vadakalai thought, this is not true. Those kind of thoughts were <br />prevalent even during the times of Ramanuja and his predecessors. <br />There was always a groups which resisted Tamizh to be practiced in <br />the Temples. </p>
<p>Nathamuni, who was the first in line of Vaishnavite Acharyas (He is <br />also referred in our <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  by Kalki during the VeeraNarayanapuram <br />episode in the first part)struggled very hard against a stiff <br />opposition, to infuse Tamizh into the Temple rituals. He even went <br />to the extent of seeking Royal Patronage, to get this accomplished. <br />But the unfortunate thing is that, no one accepts this among the <br />Vaishnavite community. They are just happy saying that due <br />to "Divine Intervention" he was able to put it into the Temple <br />Worship. True that everything is due to "Divine Intervention", but <br />the method of happening was conviniently suppressed to ascribe a <br />Mysticism to the Azhwars and Acharyas. </acronym></p>
<p>It is believed widely that the king whom Nathamuni approached for <br />getting his intervention to use Thamizh in Vishnu Temples was either <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  or <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym . This can be inferred from the time lines of both <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and <br /><acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym . I forgot the date of Nathamuni. I will confirm it soon. We all <br />know the dates of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym . I, repeat I, presume that during the <br />fag end days of Nathamuni, <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  would have succeeded <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym . This, <br />however can be verified on getting the dates of Nathamuni.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Some of the above may be trivia considering the thread of <br />discussion. But I wrote the above, to just convey that there was a <br />distinct cultural difference between the North and South. And, <br />originally, the Southern Culture or the Tamizh Marabu did not have <br />the Karma Theory et al, as a part of their philosophy. But can we <br />see one Thamizh today, who will not believe in Karma theory, with <br />the exception of "TRUE" atheists? One can see clearly from the works <br />of Azhwars that, though they mention about the Karmas et al, they <br />down play the importance of it, as finally Emperuman (The Supreme <br />Being) will take care of His subjects and hence not to worry about <br />any fruits of the Karma. The group which subscribed to this thought <br />was called Thenkalai while the other which placed the Karma on a <br />very high platform was called Vadakalai. </p>
<p>But remember, the visible differences that we see today, started <br />only, approximately 300 years ago.</p>
<p>That is why I said that there was a cultural mixing, which, however, <br />happened very harmoniously and both adopted some of the others <br />practices. </p>

<blockquote><p>  Venkatesh<br />  You are probably right about the tradition starting from Alwars. </p>
<p>  But from what I know, thengalai/vadakalai is not about <br />Tamil/Sankrit, <br />  but about the origin locations of the two schools - Kanchi and <br />  Srirangam. </p>
<p>  Desikar was based in Kanchi and propounded the "vada galai" <br />thought <br />  and since Kanchi was a big university those days, probably <br />influence <br />  of Sanskrit was higher. Whereas, the theory developed in Srirangam <br />  stayed true to Alwars without too much Sanskrit influence. </p>
<p>  That is all I know.. so I will stop!<br />  Deepa</p>

<p>    Smt Deepa,</p>
<p>    Yes, you said it right. My views are the Thenkalais' position. <br />And <br />    what you said about the Vadagalais' position is very right. </p>
<p>    However, please note that the Thenkalais do not take the <br />guidance <br />    starting only from Manavala Mamunigal. He is the last Acharya in <br />  the <br />    Guruparamparai for the Thenkalais. But the Thenkalais largely <br />take <br />    refuge under the Azhwars. The name Thenkalai is because, they <br />rely <br />    too much on the Azhwars works which are in Tamizh and hence <br />    Thenkalais. </p>
<p>    On the other hand, the Vadakalais rely too much on the Sanskrit <br />    works and hence the name Vadakalais. Remember that Sanskrit is <br />    termed as Vada-mozhi by both Azhwars and Nayanmars.</p>
<p>    And it should be noted that when one talks about Sanskrit, it <br />talks <br />    a lot about the karma theory and hence an "insistence" to do a <br />    particular act to attain something. Where as in Tamizh marabu as <br />    followed by the Azhwars, this insistence is gotten rid off. If <br />one <br />    reads the Azhwars' works of entire 4000, one would see a <br />continuing <br />    thread in which, no where an Azhwar would say that an Act <br />    is "definitely required" on the part of the jeevAthma to attain <br />    mOksha. </p>
<p>    Well this is my favourite subject too. I can write more and more <br />on <br />    this, God Willing. However the problem is, this will lead to <br />more <br />    quarrels (as all might have seen about the quarrels between <br />    Vadakalais and Thenkalais) than being an enlightening one. Hence <br />I <br />    stop here.</p>
<p>    Summary: Thenkalais and Only Thenkalais do follow Manavala <br />    Mamunigal. But their philosophy did not commence from Manavala <br />    Mamunigal. Instead it starts from the Azhwars.</p>

<p>      Venkatesh<br />      Your quote below summarizes the belief of Thengalai <br />Vaishnavites.</p>
<p>        So if one were to believe Azhwars clearly, then "no effort" <br />is <br />        required on the part of the jeevathma to attain mOksha. </p>
<p>      Essentially, the Thengalais (under the guidance of Manavala <br />    Maamunigal)<br />      believe that God will take us to "salvation"/Vaikuntam on His <br />own <br />    and <br />      there is no need for "self-exertion" from us. (Truly <br />developing <br />    this <br />      attitude through self-realization is the only thing needed)</p>
<p>      (Vadagalais, on the other hand, believe that we have to exert <br />and <br />      do "saranagati" in order to achieve moksha)</p>
<p>      I am no expert on Vaishanism, but this is what I have learnt. <br />    Correct?<br />      Deepa</p>

          Non-random-Thoughts : Dasavatharam â Kamalâs 12th Avathar!        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Venkatesh<br />You are probably right about the tradition starting from Alwars. </p>
<p>But from what I know, thengalai/vadakalai is not about Tamil/Sankrit, <br />but about the origin locations of the two schools - Kanchi and <br />Srirangam. </p>
<p>Desikar was based in Kanchi and propounded the "vada galai" thought <br />and since Kanchi was a big university those days, probably influence <br />of Sanskrit was higher. Whereas, the theory developed in Srirangam <br />stayed true to Alwars without too much Sanskrit influence. </p>
<p>That is all I know.. so I will stop!<br />Deepa</p>

<p>  However, please note that the Thenkalais do not take the guidance <br />  starting only from Manavala Mamunigal. He is the last Acharya in <br />the <br />  Guruparamparai for the Thenkalais. But the Thenkalais largely take <br />  refuge under the Azhwars. The name Thenkalai is because, they rely <br />  too much on the Azhwars works which are in Tamizh and hence <br />  Thenkalais. </p>
<p>  On the other hand, the Vadakalais rely too much on the Sanskrit <br />  works and hence the name Vadakalais. Remember that Sanskrit is <br />  termed as Vada-mozhi by both Azhwars and Nayanmars.</p>
<p>  And it should be noted that when one talks about Sanskrit, it talks <br />  a lot about the karma theory and hence an "insistence" to do a <br />  particular act to attain something. Where as in Tamizh marabu as <br />  followed by the Azhwars, this insistence is gotten rid off. If one <br />  reads the Azhwars' works of entire 4000, one would see a continuing <br />  thread in which, no where an Azhwar would say that an Act <br />  is "definitely required" on the part of the jeevAthma to attain <br />  mOksha. </p>
<p>  Well this is my favourite subject too. I can write more and more on <br />  this, God Willing. However the problem is, this will lead to more <br />  quarrels (as all might have seen about the quarrels between <br />  Vadakalais and Thenkalais) than being an enlightening one. Hence I <br />  stop here.</p>
<p>  Summary: Thenkalais and Only Thenkalais do follow Manavala <br />  Mamunigal. But their philosophy did not commence from Manavala <br />  Mamunigal. Instead it starts from the Azhwars.</p>

        <p>V Venkatesh,</p>
<p>I agree with you and really respect for your stand when you say that<br />the pointers are strong but does not conclude anything. I think this<br />is a healthy approach because its very difficult to conclude anything<br />from the past and we can only infer. Whereas we are so tuned to jump<br />to conclusion without even seeing the other side of the coin. </p>

        <p>Dear Sathish,</p>
<p>I dont find anything out of context in your question. In fact your <br />question is opening another perspective which is very good for a <br />healthy debate.</p>
<p>Please note that whatever I wrote regarding the "thirumangalyam" <br />practice is an "inference" based on the words of Andal and <br />Thirumangai Azhwar. None of know the reality. We have to only infer <br />and we have to rely heavily on various historical writings, <br />sculptures are inscriptions (both stone and copper plate) for infer <br />on certain things that happened in our past.</p>
<p>Now you have actually made my day when you said:</p>
<p>===============Quote=================<br />On tangential thinking - I hope you will accept that in brahmin</p>
<blockquote><p>  marriages, kanyadhanam and sapthapathi are the main part of the<br />  marriage and sapthapathi marks the official marriage and mangalya<br />  dharanam is just a ritual in the process. I think this is common<br />  through the brahmin .<br />============Unquote==================</p></blockquote>
<p>The very fact that "thirumangalya dharanam" is "just" a ritual in <br />the process and has lesser significance indicates that this could <br />have been adopted from another culture or so. Otherwise, when <br />everything is so important as per the sAstras then why this is just <br />a ritual and carries lesser significance. </p>
<p>And I am not sure of the date when this came into practice. But <br />remember that I wrote, this was a Tamizh Marabu and hence it could <br />have been there even during the times of Andal. But as Andal was <br />listing only the Brahministic wedding process and as she mentions <br />every step of the wedding in her "vAraNamAyiram" pAsurams, the non-<br />mention of this means that this practice might not have been <br />prevalent with the Brahmin community during her time.</p>
<p>Remember that I am not saying that the entire process creeped in <br />only during 6th or 7th century. Only that, it was not a part of <br />Brahmin Marriage, and was adopted at a later stage.</p>
<p>I could still be wrong as these are my inferences based on the <br />pAsurams of Andal and Thirumangai Azhwar. However the pointers are <br />strong, repeat strong (does not conclude though) that this could be <br />the case.</p>
<p>Hope I have clarified.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>

<p>  Again with a disclaimer - I am no expert on customs and traditions <br />(or<br />  an other subject :) ). </p>
<p>  If Andal or nammazhwar has not mentioned the 'thali' marabu in the<br />  marriage ceremony - did it come into practice only after 6th or 7th<br />  (?) century? </p>
<p>  On tangential thinking - I hope you will accept that in brahmin<br />  marriages, kanyadhanam and sapthapathi are the main part of the<br />  marriage and sapthapathi marks the official marriage and mangalya<br />  dharanam is just a ritual in the process. I think this is common<br />  through the brahmin . </p>
<p>  So is there any possibility andal or nammazhwar left the 'thali'<br />  unmentioned in the paasurams?</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Jayashree<br />This quote below from your blog is puzzling..</p>
<blockquote><p>  People must know that un-touchability as it was practiced against <br />  dalits was not practiced by Brahmins. </p></blockquote>
<p>Really? Of course, people practising austerities do not touch <br />anybody, even their families. But we cant deny that Dalits were on a <br />entirely different level of discrimination.. I dont need to go into <br />all the sordid details...we all know that.</p>
<p>Just for the record, I happen to belong to a Brahmin family, brought <br />up in an agraharam in my early years. Much as I admire the lives of <br />many staunch Brahmins I know for their scholarship, intelligence, and <br />the austere lives they led, I cannot help feeling ashamed of these <br />practices.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Tamil nadu seems to progress faster in this area than <br />many Northern states. </p>
<p>&lt;!--[if !supportLists]-- (2) &lt;!--[endif]-- The sudden and unwarranted <br />intrusion of caste in Asin's father's dialogue <br />when Krishnaveni was weeping over the body of Bhoo varahan.<br />People must know that un-touchability as it was practiced against <br />dalits<br />was not practiced by Brahmins. <br />The one engaged in austerities, vratha, prayer etc will not touch <br />anything, anyone.<br />He will not touch his own family members, <br />even his child till his pooja or vratham was over.<br />Krishnaveni in traditional widowhood attire is a stanch follower of <br />such austerities.<br />It is for that reason she does not touch others.<br />Kamal's dialogue here is against truth.<br />He gives a wrong impression to the viewer about Brahmins.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>V Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Again with a disclaimer - I am no expert on customs and traditions (or<br />an other subject :) ). </p>
<p>If Andal or nammazhwar has not mentioned the 'thali' marabu in the<br />marriage ceremony - did it come into practice only after 6th or 7th<br />(?) century? </p>
<p>On tangential thinking - I hope you will accept that in brahmin<br />marriages, kanyadhanam and sapthapathi are the main part of the<br />marriage and sapthapathi marks the official marriage and mangalya<br />dharanam is just a ritual in the process. I think this is common<br />through the brahmin . </p>
<p>So is there any possibility andal or nammazhwar left the 'thali'<br />unmentioned in the paasurams?</p>
<p>Just thinking aloud. THis is not inline with what we discuss...so if<br />you feel this is out of context, please ignore...</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Satish</p>

        <p>Venkatesh<br />Your quote below summarizes the belief of Thengalai Vaishnavites.</p>
<blockquote><p>  So if one were to believe Azhwars clearly, then "no effort" is <br />  required on the part of the jeevathma to attain mOksha. </p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, the Thengalais (under the guidance of Manavala Maamunigal)<br />believe that God will take us to "salvation"/Vaikuntam on His own and <br />there is no need for "self-exertion" from us. (Truly developing this <br />attitude through self-realization is the only thing needed)</p>
<p>(Vadagalais, on the other hand, believe that we have to exert and <br />do "saranagati" in order to achieve moksha)</p>
<p>I am no expert on Vaishanism, but this is what I have learnt. Correct?<br />Deepa</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>I am no expert, but I am a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  puzzled. If the thali concept is from<br />north brahmins, today's north indians do not have the same sentiments<br />to the 'thali' as south indians. For North Indians, as far as I know,<br />mangal sutra, is a 'karugu mani' black in colour and is just a<br />identification of marriage. I know that north indians remove the thali<br />before going to bed and wear it only in the morning. I can be wrong<br />but this is what I have seen/heard. (ofcourse this has become a more<br />matter of convenience these days than tradition).</acronym></p>
<p>To digress - when I watched the movie for a second time (online), i<br />was bowled by a detail in the climax. I am not sure whether I got it<br />right, but when the patti kamal is crying with poovaraghavn in her<br />lap, Asin's father talks about caste. I noticed that he is wearing his<br />poonal as a malai rather than the conventional cross over - from left<br />shoulder to under right arm.</p>
<p>As per sastras, poonal should be worn only as a malai, whenever nithya<br />karma's are not performed. While doing homama and other good karmas,<br />its worn from left shoulder to under right arm, while doing pitru<br />karyam, its from right shoulder to under left arm and while doing no<br />karma, its just a malai. Also, its said that while wearing it as<br />malai, there is no 'theetu'.</p>
<p>But this is not followed much these days and we find people wearing it<br />from left shoulder (except for few orthodox brahmins). </p>
<p>Coming back to the movie, if the scene was intentional, then its a<br />master stroke of Kamal (he is the actual director,right :) ). But when<br />this was taken care, why other masala like throwing the 'thali' etc is<br />my question.</p>

        <p>I forgot this one. I do not agree with the words of Smt Jayasree <br />where she says</p>
<blockquote><p>  The difficult anushtaanam (code of ethics) to aspire for Vaikuntam </p></blockquote>
<p>If this is true, then this goes very well against the verses of <br />Nammazhwar, where (as quoted by Smt Jayasree herself) he <br />says "Vaikuntam puguvadhum maNNavar vidhiyE". Yes, it is true that <br />as per the Azhwars' words, it is destined for everyone in this world <br />to reach Vaikuntam. So when it is already destined for the jeevathma <br />to go to Vaikuntam, why does this jeevathma need to do any difficult <br />anushtAnam? </p>
<p>So if one were to believe Azhwars clearly, then "no effort" is <br />required on the part of the jeevathma to attain mOksha. </p>
<p>This may not be relevant to the historical discussions as it is more <br />philosophical. But I just wanted to express this disagreement.</p>

<p>    The one characteristic of Ramanuja's followers was "vairagya" ? <br />    steadfastness.<br />    Koorathazhwar did not wait for Cholan's men to pierce his eyes.<br />    He himself pierced his eyes.<br />    His companion, Mudaliyandan swami, who was 100 years then <br />    too pierced his eyes!<br />    The vairagyam was the hallmark of unwavering disciples of <br />Ramanuja.<br />    The difficult anushtaanam (code of ethics) to aspire for <br />Vaikuntam <br />    also required them to be strong in their mind.</p>

        <p>Vijay,</p>
<p>I have said this before in our own discussions. Of course, I dont <br />claim to be an authority on this. But nevertheless it is recorded <br />in "kOil ozhugu" and other Vaishnavite works that Koorthazhwan <br />plucked his eyes himself saying that "ippadi oru arasanaikk kANda <br />kaNgaL, inimElum ennaku vENdAm". </p>
<p>However his companion is not Mudaliandan as indicated by Smt <br />Jayasree. That was Periya Nambi, the Guru or Acharya of both <br />Ramanuja and Koorathazhwan. We did discuss this earlier. </p>

          Non-random-Thoughts : Dasavatharam â Kamalâs 12th Avathar!        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Smt Jayasree,</p>
<p>A great write up. As Satish said, surely Kamal "might" not have <br />thought about these things in such finer details. The best one was <br />your reference to "kAyEnavAchA.." and "sarva dharmAn parityajya..". <br />Yes those would have been very apt.</p>
<p>One small correction to your write up is, the companion of <br />KoorathAzhwar was not Mudhaliandan but Periya Nambi.</p>
<p>Regarding the "thAli" issue, the observation is very valid. However, <br />it looks like the concept of "thAli" has crept in between the times <br />of Andal and Thirumangai Azhwar. If one would observe clearly, Andal <br />elaborates on a Brahministic Wedding in her Varanamayiram pAsurams. <br />That goes to prove that "Thirumangalyam" or "thAli" was not a part <br />of Brahmin Rituals in her days. But essentially it was a part of <br />the "paNdaith thamizhar" marabu. </p>
<p>This may raise a lot of eyebrows and may even lead to something like <br />a discussion on Aryan-Dravidian divide. My intention is not on that. <br />I am sure we would all agree that there was a difference in the <br />marabu followed by the Tamizhs and the ones followed by the Indians <br />from the North. Let me stop saying that there was a migration, <br />repeat migration and not invasion, from North to South and both the <br />cultures mixed up very well harmoniously. In that process the <br />Brahmins, who were more Sanskrit oriented adopted, the thAli <br />practice.</p>
<p>Now coming to Thirumangai Azhwar's pAsuram on Thiruvallikkeni, he <br />says that "... sandhamal kuzhalAL alakkaN nURRuvar tham peNdirum <br />eidhi, nool izhappa..."</p>
<p>"sandhamal kuzhalAL" refers to Draupadhi,with Dark Hair, "alakkaN"- <br />the difficulties faced by her, "nURRuvar tham peNdir" refers to the <br />wives of the 100 Kauravas and comes the main word "nool izhappa". <br />This refers to the fact that all the 100 Kauravas were killed in the <br />battle and hence all their wives lost their "nool" or what is <br />otherwise called as "thAli".</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Thirumangai Azhwar was referring to <br />some Indians in the north, but attributed his understanding of the <br />marriage to them. Hence used the word "nool" referring to "thAli". <br />However if one would want to say that as Thirumangai Azhwar was <br />referring to North Indians wives as having "thAli" then it is <br />evident that the Brahmins also practised it, then it will not go <br />well with Andal's Varanamayiram pAsuram, in which she talks about <br />all the rituals of wedding except the "thirumangalya thAraNam", <br />which if prevalent at those times, she would have definitely <br />referred to.</p>
<p>Request members to add their views and opinions to the above.</p>

        <p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>Very nicely described.</p>
<p>thanks. anbudan / sps</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Vijay Kumar .S" <br /><vj.episteme@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  hi satish</p>
<p>  people do have great imaginations - especially when they want to <br />see <br />  some parallels ( we have found so many that anything that we see <br />now <br />  is a scene from PS) anyway, got this as a forward and it was too <br />  good to pass</p>
<p>  For Kamal fans </p>
<p>  One thing we had noticed is why people didn't get the real subtext <br />  and reason for the various roles and hence the title.<br />  If you knew the real dasavatharams of Lord Vishnu and their <br />  characters you can appreciate the script more. <br />  Let me explain, starting with the best adapted role:</p>
<p>  1. Krishna avatar - Vincent Poovaraghavan<br />  Lord krishna is actually a dalit, he is dark-skinned [shyamalam]. <br />He <br />  saved draupadi when she was being violated and he was the actual <br />  diplomat in mahabharatham. Lord krishna dies of an arrow striking <br />  his lower leg. Now look at how vincent was introduced.. he appears <br />  when asin is about to be molested and he saves her like draupadi. <br />  Vincent is the dalit diplomat, fights for land issue [soil issue <br />to <br />  be exact] and dies from the metal rod striking his leg. Oh even <br />five <br />  of vincent's men are drugged at P. Vasu's.. sounds familiar???</p>
<p>  2. Balarama avatar - Balarama naidu<br />  This is an easy given. as the name suggests and the role <br />personifies <br />  you can easily get it.</p>
<p>  3. Mathsya avatar - Ranagaraja nambi<br />  nambi is thrown into water in an act of trying to save lord from <br />  being thrown into sea, though vainly. what more clue do you want?</p>
<p>  4. Varaha avatar - Krishnaveni paatti<br />  During the mukunda song, krishnaveni paatti does varaha avatar in <br />  the shadow puppetry. The frame freezes on it for a second. there <br />is <br />  the clue. Moreover, in varaha avatar lord actually hides earth so <br />as <br />  to protect life forms. Here too krishnaveni hides the germs - life <br />  form inside the statue so as to protect.</p>
<p>  5. Vamana avatar - Kalifulla khan<br />  remember in vamana avatar, lord vishnu takes the vishvaroopa, that <br />  is the giant form! Hence the giant kalifulla here symbolises <br />vamana <br />  avatar. <br />  6. Parasurama avatar - Christian Fletcher<br />  Parasurama is actually on an angry killing spree and killed 21 <br />  generations of the particular kshatriya vamsa. Hence the real <br />  KILLER... Guess what thats what our Fletcher is! He comes around <br />  with the gun [modern upgrade for axe] and kills everyone around. I <br />  have to check if he kills 21 people though. :-D</p>
<p>  7. Narasimha avatar - Shingen Narahashi<br />  first of all the name itself is a play on the words singam [means <br />  lion in tamil] and narasimha [the avatar being symbolised]. Lord <br />  Narasimha manifests himelf to kill the bad guy and he also teaches <br />  prahaladha. In the movie, he shows up to kill the killer fletcher! <br />  and is also a teacher.. Lord Narasimha had to kill the asura with <br />  bare hands and hence the martial arts exponent here.. get it?</p>
<p>  8. Rama avatar - Avatar Singh<br />  Lord Rama stands for the one man one woman maxim, kind of <br />  symbolising true love.. Here Avatar portrays that spirit by saying <br />  that he loves his woman more than anything and wants to live for <br />her.</p>
<p>  9. Kalki avatar - Govindaraj Ramasamy<br />  As you know, the hero in kaliyug can be none other than the Kalki <br />  avatar!!!</p>
<p>  10. Koorma avatar - Bush<br />  This is the most loose adaptation I couldn't clearly comprehend. <br />But <br />  if you look at the real koorma avatar, the lord is the <br />  turtle/tortoise that helps in stirring the ksheera sagara and <br />  bringing out the amruth. This essentially creates war among the <br />  devas and asuras. Similarly today Bush facilitates war between you <br />  know whom... May be Kamal also indicates that this avatar is a bit <br />  dumb like the tortoise...</p>

<p></p></blockquote>
<p>hi satish</p>
<p>people do have great imaginations - especially when they want to see <br />some parallels ( we have found so many that anything that we see now <br />is a scene from <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ) anyway, got this as a forward and it was too <br />good to pass</acronym></p>
<p>For Kamal fans </p>
<p>One thing we had noticed is why people didn't get the real subtext <br />and reason for the various roles and hence the title.<br />If you knew the real dasavatharams of Lord Vishnu and their <br />characters you can appreciate the script more. <br />Let me explain, starting with the best adapted role:</p>
<p>1. Krishna avatar - Vincent Poovaraghavan<br />Lord krishna is actually a dalit, he is dark-skinned [shyamalam]. He <br />saved draupadi when she was being violated and he was the actual <br />diplomat in mahabharatham. Lord krishna dies of an arrow striking <br />his lower leg. Now look at how vincent was introduced.. he appears <br />when asin is about to be molested and he saves her like draupadi. <br />Vincent is the dalit diplomat, fights for land issue [soil issue to <br />be exact] and dies from the metal rod striking his leg. Oh even five <br />of vincent's men are drugged at P. Vasu's.. sounds familiar???</p>
<p>2. Balarama avatar - Balarama naidu<br />This is an easy given. as the name suggests and the role personifies <br />you can easily get it.</p>
<p>3. Mathsya avatar - Ranagaraja nambi<br />nambi is thrown into water in an act of trying to save lord from <br />being thrown into sea, though vainly. what more clue do you want?</p>
<p>4. Varaha avatar - Krishnaveni paatti<br />During the mukunda song, krishnaveni paatti does varaha avatar in <br />the shadow puppetry. The frame freezes on it for a second. there is <br />the clue. Moreover, in varaha avatar lord actually hides earth so as <br />to protect life forms. Here too krishnaveni hides the germs - life <br />form inside the statue so as to protect.</p>
<p>5. Vamana avatar - Kalifulla khan<br />remember in vamana avatar, lord vishnu takes the vishvaroopa, that <br />is the giant form! Hence the giant kalifulla here symbolises vamana <br />avatar. <br />6. Parasurama avatar - Christian Fletcher<br />Parasurama is actually on an angry killing spree and killed 21 <br />generations of the particular kshatriya vamsa. Hence the real <br />KILLER... Guess what thats what our Fletcher is! He comes around <br />with the gun [modern upgrade for axe] and kills everyone around. I <br />have to check if he kills 21 people though. :-D</p>
<p>7. Narasimha avatar - Shingen Narahashi<br />first of all the name itself is a play on the words singam [means <br />lion in tamil] and narasimha [the avatar being symbolised]. Lord <br />Narasimha manifests himelf to kill the bad guy and he also teaches <br />prahaladha. In the movie, he shows up to kill the killer fletcher! <br />and is also a teacher.. Lord Narasimha had to kill the asura with <br />bare hands and hence the martial arts exponent here.. get it?</p>
<p>8. Rama avatar - Avatar Singh<br />Lord Rama stands for the one man one woman maxim, kind of <br />symbolising true love.. Here Avatar portrays that spirit by saying <br />that he loves his woman more than anything and wants to live for her.</p>
<p>9. Kalki avatar - Govindaraj Ramasamy<br />As you know, the hero in kaliyug can be none other than the Kalki <br />avatar!!!</p>
<p>10. Koorma avatar - Bush<br />This is the most loose adaptation I couldn't clearly comprehend. But <br />if you look at the real koorma avatar, the lord is the <br />turtle/tortoise that helps in stirring the ksheera sagara and <br />bringing out the amruth. This essentially creates war among the <br />devas and asuras. Similarly today Bush facilitates war between you <br />know whom... May be Kamal also indicates that this avatar is a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  <br />dumb like the tortoise... </acronym></p>
