<blockquote><p>   Dear Manivannan,</p>
<p>   In history, we find a very curious<br />phenomenon. The winning<br />   country goes bank-rupt after a few years.<br />   Spain is a very fine example. The Mexican<br />silver and the<br />   Incan and Aztec gold, apart from the other rich<br />products should<br />   have made Spain into a very rich country. It<br />reached its pinnacle<br />   of power and success during the rule of Charles V.<br />But it was<br />   during his time that Spain went bankrupt.<br />   The other example is Thuglaq's Delhi.</p></blockquote>
<p>=========================================================</p>
<p>Manivannan writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>  The Spanish case is a special, or not so<br />special,<br /> case of economic history. The looted gold was NOT<br />invested<br /> in productive, i.e., value-adding, real assets. The net<br /> result was that the excessive inflow of gold caused<br /> excessive inflation and ruined people. Thuglaq's<br />case is<br /> very similar. Contrast with babar and Akbar and<br />Shajahan,<br /> who use the wawealth they obtained and/or inherited in<br /> productive, employment cresating activities, an old<br />form of<br /> Keynisian economics.</p></blockquote>
<p>==============================================================</p>
<p>JayBee follows up:<br />True.<br />Tamilnadu was immensely rich for a long time.<br />Marco Polo<br />says that it was the richest kingdom in the world<br />(around 1270).<br />Frequent wars and conquest resulted in abundant booty<br />which<br />suddenly filled the treasury and the all the<br />soldier's purses,<br />thus pouring out into the general public.<br />Malik Kafur claims to have taken 96000 maunds<br />(????; 1 ???? = 14 ????) of gold, precious stones, etc., from<br />Tamilnadu, laden on the backs of 360 elephants, as<br />war booty.<br />This is according to his own historians.<br />The fact is, all these riches belonged to<br />Tamilnadu.<br />And more. Because the Malik did not go into the<br />ChOlzha and<br />ChEra territory proper.<br />We can surmise that these riches were<br />accumulated by<br />trade, productivity, taxes, and mining. But a major<br />part of<br />it would have been war-booty. And we must keep in<br />mind that<br />their frequently victorious armies were causing<br />greater and<br />greater influx of riches.<br />Now, how did Tamilnadu absorb this richness?<br />Did they suffer from inflation?<br />How did they buffer against inflation?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>==============================================</p>
<p>The Richness of Tamilnadu</p>
<p>Strabo wries that every year, about the time of the summer solstice,<br />120 ships sail from Hormos, an Egyptian port on the Red Sea. They<br />traversed the sea by making use of the monsoon. They reached the ports<br />of Tamilakam in forty days.<br />The ships returned with a rich cargo which was off-loaded at and<br />river to Alexandria. The cargo then reached the capital(Rome).<br />The author of 'Periplus of Mare Erythream' says:<br />'The produce of the soil like pepper, great quantities of best pearl<br />are likewise purchased here; ivory, silk in the web, spikenard from<br />the Ganges, betel from the countries further to the east, transparent<br />stones of all kinds, diamonds, rubies and tortoise shell from the<br />Golden Chersonese(Malaya) or from the island off the coast of<br />Limurike(Sumatra). This is all from the port of Muzizris on the west<br />coast.<br />He goes on to say:<br />There is great resort of shipping to this port for pepper and betel; the merchants bring out a large quantity of spice, and their other<br />imports are topazes, stibium, coral, fling, glass, brass, and lead, a<br />small quantity of wine as profittable as at Barugaza(modern<br />Broach-Gujerat), cinnabar, fine cloth, arsenic and wheat, not for sale<br />but for the use of the crew.</p>
<p>This is supported by the Sanggam description of Musiri - Musiri to<br />which the well-rigged ships of the Yavanas come, bringing gold and<br />taking away spices-pepper(kaRi) in exchange.</p>
<p>Fine muslins and jewels, especially beryls and pearls were exported<br />from Tamilakam, for personal adornment. Drugs, spices and condiments<br />as well as costus lycium and other cosmetics fetched high prices.</p>
<p>Even greater was the demand for pepper which sold in the days of<br />Pliny at the price of 15 denarii(gold pieces) a pound. Sapphire and a<br />variety of ruby were also exported from the Pandyan kingdom. Cotton<br />stuff is compared to the 'sloughs of serpents' and 'vapour from milk'<br />and are spoken off as 'fine textures, the thread of which could not be<br />followed even by the eye.' There were thirty vairieties of silk.</p>
<p>One of the fashionable extravagances of the Romans at the time was<br />the consumption of huge quantities of spice at funerals. Even as early<br />as the days of Sulla (13-78 BC), we hear of two hundred and ten<br />talents(1520 lbs-c.680 kg) weight of spices being used at his<br />obsequies. The climax was reached in the days of Nero.<br />Petronius complains that fashionable ladies of Rome exposed their<br />charms much too immodestly,, by clothing themselves in 'the webs of<br />woven wind', as he called the muslins imported from South India.<br />Pliny says that India drained the Roman Empire annually to the extent<br />of 55,000,000 sesterces, equal to 500,000 pound sterling(1911), (This<br />will be about $60 million US dollars, now.) sending in return goods<br />which sold at a hundred times their value in India.<br />He also remarks:<br />'This is the price that we pay for our luxuries and for our women.'</p>
<p>I am giving excerpts from 'History of Pandya Country' written by<br />Prof.S.A.Q.Hussaini. Thsi book is well-researched.<br />It should be noted that this book was written before 1962. He has<br />based his facts from the treasre troves found more than 40 years<br />before his time - since the 19th century.<br />Since then, there have beeen other discoveries.</p>
<p>Roman Coins in Tamilnadu:<br />'The largst number of coins of the early emperors(Augustus to Nero)<br />has been found in the vicinity of the South Indian beryl mines which<br />produced the best and purest quality in the world. Most of the items<br />mentioned by the Roman writers have come from Tamilakam. It is for<br />this reason that so many Roman coins have been found in and near<br />Coimbatore district and at Madura, the capital of the Pandya kingdom.<br />Actually in one notable finding, were 612 gold coins and 1187 silver<br />coins. Besides these, other hoards are described as:1.'of gold coins,<br />a quantity amounting to five cooly-loads, 2. and of silver coins 'a<br />great many in a pot', 3.'about 500 in an earthern pot, 4.'a find of<br />163', 5.'some thousands enough to fill five or six Madras measures',<br />6.'pot full of coins.<br />These coins were a small part of the products of 55 separate<br />discoveries mostly of the Coimbatore and Madura districts.<br />An analysis of all these coins available, gives us coins of all the<br />emperors from Augustus to Alexander Severus(27 BC to 235 AD), a period<br />of nearly three centuries.<br />Then there is a gap of over a hundred years which suggests a<br />temporary stoppage of trade between Rome and Tamilakam. This was due<br />to internal revolts and external attacks by the various tribes of the<br />Barbarian people - Huns, Vandals, Visigoths, Ostragoths, Gauls, etc.<br />When order and good government were restored in Rome, trade with<br />Pandya country was resumed. Zeno's coins take us to the end of the<br />Roman empire.<br />With the help of these shining little bits, we can follow the<br />commercial relationship between Rome and Madura, from the time of<br />Augustus, a little before the Christian era, to the end of the fifth<br />century AD..</p>
<p>The presence in different places of Madura, of so many Roman coins,<br />found lying on the ground and in the sandy beds of the River vaigai,<br />which flows across the town, implies that these coins were in daily<br />circulation and were carelessly dropped or otherwise lost by the<br />inhabitants of the city.<br />Obviously most of the currency used by the people was Roman in<br />origin.Tamil inscriptions clearly state that the Roman 'dinarus' and<br />'drachma' had been in use among the Tamils. Colonel Tuffnel, in his<br />'Hints to Coin Collectors in Southern India', and Robert Sewell are of<br />the opinion that there might have ben a Roman settlement at or near<br />Madura. The little copper coins with the Roman Emperor's head on them<br />might have been minted locally or might represent a special issue for<br />use in a country like Tamilakam where things were cheap.</p>
<p>The Imperial Cholzhas ruled the whole of Tamilzhagam for almost three<br />centuries. But at the beginning of the 13th century, the Pandyas<br />struck back. Maravarman Sundara Pandya ravaged the Cholzha kingdom.<br />But still the Cholzhas held back.<br />Several decades later, Jatavarman Sundara Pandya invaded, ravaged,<br />destroyed, and plundered the Cholzha land.<br />He conquerd an immense amount of booty which had been hoarded up by<br />the Imperial Cholzhas for a span of two and a half centuries.<br />But Sundara Pandya did not take all the booty back to Pandya nadu.<br />Instead he made very huge donations to the temples of Cholzha nadu and<br />repaired, beautified, and made additions to a lot of Cholzhian temples.<br />Perhaps he wanted to win over the hearts of the Cholzhiya people and<br />put them at ease. The greatest benefaction was received by the<br />SriRangam temple. The next big benefactor was the Chidhambaram temple.<br />Perhaps again, Sundara Pandya may have wanted the SriVaishnavaites to<br />feel at ease and give him, a foreigner and a stauch Saivite who had no<br />love lost for the Cholzhiyans, full support.<br />The nature of these gifts was the 'Thulabara Dhanam'.<br />In the case of the SriRangam temple, the donation was done on the<br />banks of the river.<br />Let me quote from the works of Dr.Krishnaswamy Aiyengar:</p>
<p>'But what is of interest here is that these and various other things<br />such as cars, gold and jewel fittings for the cars, jewels of various<br />kinds for the God and Goddess, all these amounted to eighteen lakhs(1<br />million 8 hundred thousand) of pieces of gold of the current coin in<br />circulation.<br />This vast amount was set apart for these various purposes by a<br />peculiar kind of Thulabara(weighment against gold).<br />He got two boats constructed of the same size and weight, and had<br />them afloat in the bathing ghat that goes by the name 'Makha'(the<br />asterism in the full moon of February-March of each year under which a<br />festival takes place).<br />On one of the boats, he placed the Royal elephant of seven cubits of<br />the carpenter's yard, high; and himself mounted on it in full panoply<br />of war with all his war-like accoutrement. And on the other boat, he<br />put an equal weight of gold and pearls, and gems of all sorts so mixed<br />as to make the boat sink to the same depth as the other.<br />Then he made it over to the temple for these miscellaneous items of<br />expenditure.<br />He also received the honorific titles of 'Pon VEyndha PerumaL' and<br />HEmaachadhana Raja', 'The Great One Who Covered the Roof with Gold'.</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>Marco Polo on the richness of Pandya country:</p>
<p>When you leave the island of Seilan(Ceylon), and sail<br />westward about 60 milaes, you come to the great province of Maabar<br />which is styled 'India the Greater', it is best of all the indies and<br />is on the main land. You must know that in this province are five<br />kings, who are own brothers. I will tell you about each of them in<br />turn. The provnce is the finest and noblst in th<br />At this end of the province reigns one of<br />those five Royal Brothers, who is crowned king, and his name is SONDER<br />BANDI DAVAR  In his kingdom they find very fine and great pearls.</p>
<p>It is a fact that this king goes as bare as the<br />rest, only around his loins he has a piece of fine cloth, and round<br />his neck he has a necklace entirely of precious stones - rubies,<br />sapphires, emeralds, and the like, insomuch that this collar is of<br />great value. He wears also hanging in front of his chest, from the<br />ncek downwards, a fine silk thread strung with 104 large pearls and<br />rubies of gre</p>
<p>The King aforesaid also wears on his arms,<br />three golden bracelets, thickly set with pearls of great value, and<br />anklets also of the kind that he wears on his legs, and rings on his<br />toes likewis<br />So let me tell you what this King wears between<br />gold, gems, and pearls, is worth more than a city's ranso</p>
<p>And 'tis no wonder; for he hath great store of<br />such gear. And besides they are found in his kingdom. Moreover nobody<br />is permitted to take out of the kingdom, a pearl weighing more than<br />half a saggio, unless he manages to do it secretly. This order is<br />given because the king desires to reserve all such to</p>
<p>And so in fact, the quantity he has is something<br />almost incredible.</p>
<p>Cail is a noble city and belongs to Ashar, the<br />eldest of the five brother Kings. It is at this city that all the<br />ships touch that come from the west, as from Hormos and from Kis and<br />from Aden and all Arabia, laden with horses and with other things for<br />sale. And this brings a great concourse of people from the country<br />round about, and so there is great business done in this cit</p>
<p>The king possesses vast treasures, and weras<br />upon his person great store of rich jewels. He maintains great state<br />and and administers his kingdom with great equity, and extends great<br />favour to merchants and foreigners, so that they are glad to visit his</p>
<p>When the king dies, none of his childeren dares<br />to touch his treasure. For they say, As our father did gather together<br />all this treasure, so we ought to accumulate as much in our turn. And<br />in this way, it comes to pass that there is an immensity of treasure<br />accumulated in this king.</p>
<p>Wassaf says:</p>
<p>Ma'bar extends in length from Kulam(Quilon) to Nilawar(Nellore),<br />nearly three hundred parasangs along the sea coast. And in that<br />country the king is called Dewar, which signifies the Lord of Empire.</p>
<p>The curiosities of Chin and machin, and the beautiful products of Hind<br />and Sind, laden on large ships(which they call junks) sailing like<br />mountains with wings of the winds on the surface of the water, always<br />arriving</p>
<p>The wealth of the isles of the Persian Gulf in<br />particular, and in part the beauty and adornment of other countries,<br />from 'Irak and Khurasan as far as Rum and Europe, are derived from<br />Ma'bar, which is so situated as to be the key of Hin</p>
<p>In the months of the year 692 H, the above<br />mentioned Dewar, the ruler of Ma'bar, died, and left behind him much<br />wealth and treasure. It is related by Malik-ul-Islam Jamul-ud din,<br />that out of that treasure 7000 oxen, laden with precious stones, and<br />pure gold and silver, fell to the share of the brother who succeeded.</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>Pandya's Horse Trade with the Arabs:Marco Polo-</p>
<p>Here are no horses bred. And thus a great part of the wealth of the<br />country is is wasted in purchasing horses.<br />I will tell you how. You must know the merchants of KIS and HORMEZ,<br />DOFAR and SODEN and ADEN collect great number os destriers and other<br />horses, and these they bring to the territories of this king and his<br />four brothers, who are kings likewise as I told you. For a horse will<br />fetch among them 500 saggi of gold worth more than 100 marks of<br />silver. And vast numbers are sold every year.<br />Indeed this king wants to buy more than 2000 horses every year, and so<br />do his four brothers who are kings likewise. The reason why they want<br />so many horses every year is that by the end of the year there shall<br />not be 100 of them remaining, for they all die off. And this arises<br />from mismanagement, for those people do not know in the least how to<br />treat a horse; and besides they have no farriers. The horse merchants<br />not only never bring farriers with them, but they also prevent any<br />farrier from going thither, lest they should in any degree baulk the<br />sale of the horese, which brings them in ever year vast gains. They<br />bring these horses by sea aboard ships.</p>

<p>It was a matter of agreement that Maliku-l Islam Jamalu-d din and the<br />merchants sholud embark every year from the island of Kais, and land<br />at Ma'bar, 1400 horses of his own breed, and of such generous origin<br />that, in comparison with them the most celebrated horses of antiquity,<br />such as the Rukhs of Rustam, etc., should be worthless as the horses<br />of the chess-board.<br />It was also agreed that he should embark as many as he could procure<br />from all the isles of Persia, such as Katif, Lahsa, Bahrein, Hurmuz,<br />and Kulhatu.<br />The price of each horse was fixed from as of old at 220 dinars of red<br />gold, on this condition, that if any horses should sustain any injury<br />during the voyage, or should happen to die, the value of them should<br />be paid from the royal treasury.<br />It is related by authentic writers that in the reign of Atabak Abu<br />Bakr, 10000 horses were annually exported from these places to Ma'bar,<br />Kambayat, and other other ports in their neighbourhood, and the sum<br />total of their value amounted to 2,200,000 dinars, which was paid out<br />of the overflowing revenues of the estates and endowments belonging to<br />the Hindu temples and no charge was incurred.</p>
<p>Marco Polo says:</p>
<p>And another strange thing to be told is that<br />there is no possibility of breeding horses in this country. For even<br />when a great blood-mare here has been covered by a great blood horse,<br />the produce is nothing but a wretched wry-legged weed, not fit to ride.</p>
<p>Wassaf says:</p>
<p>In a short time, the most strong, swift, fresh, and<br />active horses become weak, slow, useless, and stupid. In short they<br />all become wretched and good for nothing. In this climate, these<br />powerful horses which fly swiftly without a whip(for whips are<br />required for horses, especially if they are to go to any distances),<br />should they happen to cover, become exceedingly weak and altogether<br />worn out and unfit for riding. There is therefore, a constant<br />necessity of getting new horses annually, and, consequently, the<br />merchants of Muhammadan countries bring them to Ma'bar.</p>

<p>I think its more suitable to deal with your queries in<br />the chronological sequence.</p>
<p>Which takes us back to the times of the Imperial<br />Pandyas. The Cholzhas were finished off by the late 13th century; the<br />Pandyas took control of Tamilnadu. In the north, was the large<br />sultanate of Delhi. South of the Vindyas, there were four small<br />empires. The Yadavas Devagiri ruling over Maratha territory; Kaakaththiiyas of Telengaana/Northern Andra; HoysaaLa of Karnataka; and The Pandyas of Tamilnadu.</p>
<p>The last of the Grand Pandyas, Maravarman Kulasekara was ruling. As<br />was the prevalent custom at that time, the Pandyan territory was ruled<br />by five Pandyas who happened to be brothers or uncles The main Pandya<br />ruled at Madurai.</p>
<p>The northern capital was at Jayangonda Cholapuram , 6<br />miles from Gangaikonda Cholapuram, somewhere near Kumbakonam. At the<br />time when Kulasekara was ruling, Marco Polo who visited the Pandya<br />country, described it as the richest country in the world.</p>
<p>Wasaf, the Arab historian, says the the Emperor had accumulated 1000<br />crores of gold in the capital city of Madurai. This was in addition to<br />the great storage of pearls, and other jems. We have to digress a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym ,<br />to see the Muslim connection. For a very very long time, Tamilnadu had<br />colonies of Romans, Jews, Arabs, etc.</acronym></p>
<p>Large settlements of Arabs were found in coastal towns. They had<br />intermarried with Tamils who had converted, but pure Arabs were always<br />there in large numbers. The Arabs were very very rich and very<br />influential. The most important Arab colony was known as Vajranaadu.<br />This was the land around Ramanathapuram. The main metropolis was<br />Kiilzhakkarai which was called Pauththiramaanikka Pattinam; it was<br />known as Ma'abar and Fatan also. The local Arabs named it as<br />Vahudhaapuri-named after Baghdad.</p>
<p>A royal prince from Medina and a few islands of the Gulf was the<br />chief of that area. He was Takiyuddin Abdur Rahman. He had a very<br />large commercial network.</p>
<p>Among many of his business ventures, one noteworthy programme was a<br />contract made with the Pandyan Emperor. Takiyuddin undertook to bring<br />10000 horses every year to the Pandya country; the cost was 220 gold<br />pieces per horse. The import was at the risk of the Emperor.</p>
<p>That contract alone brought Takiyuddin 2.2 million gold coins every<br />year. As chief of the Arabs, he was known as the Maliki Azam<br />Marzabanil Hindii. "Hind" was the name that the Arabs called India.</p>
<p>In addition, he was one of the ministers of the Empire. There is a<br />local ballad which says that Takiyuddin married a Pandyan princess and<br />became the sixth Pandyan in addition to the other five. Kulasekara in<br />one of his wars, sent an invasion to Ceylon. His commander, Arya<br />Chakravarthi looted Ceylon and captured the Holy Tooth Relic of<br />Buddha. The Singhalese king had to come bare-footed to Madurai and<br />fall at the feet of Kulasekara with tribute and got back the Tooth<br />relic. This was the highest peak of the glory the Pandyas. After that,<br />the Pandyas declined in power.</p>

<p>JayBee, very interesting. I also read recently in the<br />prototype of the the heirloom quality edition of Tamil Heritage<br />handbook-cum-Thirukkural by the International tamil language<br />foundation a quote of Marco Polo that said, "1200 crores of gold coins<br />and vast quanitities of gems and pearls".</p>
<p>If one calculates to compare the current budget of TN, the gold<br />deposit alone amounts to almost 1200 years' worth budget assuming 1<br />gold coin = 1 pavun (8 gm) as was the case since the Gupta period even<br />though some Chola coins were 1/2 pavun and and 4000 Rs/pavun the<br />annual TN budget is about Rs. 4000 crores;( I know it was about<br />Rs.1000 crores 15 years ago).</p>
<p>Unbelievable wealth! No doubt invaders lined up to plunder India!</p>
<p>Also no wonder that Tamil emperors like karikAl vaLavan gave 16 lakh<br />gold coins to great pulavars such as katiyalUr uruththirangkaNNanaR as<br />reward for their poetry! I wonder how much KarikAl vaLavan must have<br />had...he had 11 mantapams one of which was made of pearls awarded by a<br />king from an island nation. Of course, one chEran gave 40 lakhs gold<br />coins to a pulavar whose poem is in the pathiRRUppaththu!</p>
<p>As for the horse trade, the Pandiyans never learnt from earlier<br />debacles: mANikkavAcakar etc. Of course with 1200 crores gold coins,<br />he would never be bankrupted...but 2.2 million gold coins per year is<br />2.2/12000 = 1/5450 of the wealth not bad for defence budget...I think<br />advannced countries spend a few percent per year of GDP but *not*<br />total wealth on defence...India spends much more on defence.<br />Interesting to compare with the present day to get a better perspective.</p>

<p>Yes Chandra.<br />The riches were accumulated wealth for a period of<br />more than 2000 years, i.e., 1000B.C-1300A.D.</p>
<p>The Romans and others were having immense trade with Tamilzhakam.<br />Apart from the wine, weaponary, and women, and mercenaries, the Tamils<br />got from the Romans, the Roman Aureus, the Roman gold. 12 million<br />sesterces of gold was paid annually to India.</p>
<p>One of the articles that the Romans wanted was pepper. Gold was<br />cheap in Rome. They stole it elsewhere. Sometimes pepper was paid its<br />weight in gold.</p>
<p>The drainage of Roman gold worried the Romans so much t hat Pliny<br />lamented about it and the Roman Senate moved an embargo on trade with<br />the Tamils. The drainage was so bad that in later times the Roman gold<br />coins became debased with copper. But on the other hand, there was so<br />much Roman gold coins in Tamilnaadu that, we were using the Drachma<br />and Dinar well until the 13th century. The Drachma was known as<br />"thiraamam" and the Dinar as "thinaaram".</p>
<p>We were also getting gold from north.</p>
<p>There was also goldfrom Siberia. It found its way into India through<br />the "Silk Route". It reached south via the "Dakshina paadha"-the<br />Southern Grand Trunk Road". Due to rupture caused by the Huns, Yueh<br />Chi,and others, this gold trickled down.<br />So the Tamils tured East. We developed South East Asia and ther was<br />plenty of gold there.</p>
<p>So Malaya earned the name Suvarna Diipa, and Sumatra became the<br />Suvarna Bumi.</p>
<p>All along the 2500 years, the Tamils were never conquered and so<br />nobody looted. But we looted others, on and off, now and then. Then<br />there was also the locally mined gold. That was how so much gold was<br />acumulated.</p>
<p>How did the Tamils prevent inflation, when there is so much influx of<br />gold? I'll come to that later.</p>

<p>As I had commented before in the vvv thread, if there<br />was that much wealth, it becomes believable that women would throw<br />their golden ear rings and pearl necklaces in their tiffs with their<br />husband... I would also say that the current budget for TN would have<br />to be smaller if there were no corruption. In those days, with no<br />corruption, there must have been enormous amount of wealth distributed<br />among the people just as it is with the western countries these days.</p>

<p>One of the interesting things about Cilapathikaram is<br />that kOvalan and kaNNaki set out to start their new life in Madurai<br />with nothing but a pair of cilampukaL. Even with mANikka paralkaL, I<br />wondered how much were they really worth. It turns out that in Pandian<br />Capital, the only jeweller considered rich enough to afford kaNNaki's<br />anklets is the jeweler to the King! Moreover, even he considers it to<br />be of such high quality that he steals it and replaces it for the<br />Queen's anklets! One wonders how wealthy the kOvalan-kaNNaki family<br />must have been to afford such an expensive jewel. And then in the<br />court room scene, kaNNaki proudly declares her to be the<br />daughter-in-law of mAcAthuvAn, the great merchant of the city of<br />pUmpukAr. It appears that the merchants were wealthy enough to rival<br />the royals, some times acting as the bankers to the royalty - much<br />like the European merchants of the colonial era.</p>
<p>However, I doubt if the wealth distribution was fair.</p>

<p>But as you suggested, the Tamilian prosperity etc.,<br />can be<br />dealt with in the culture thread or we can open new threads. You can<br />study the changes that have taken place in Tamilian personality.<br />People tend to think that the Tamils were very superstitious and too<br />orientated towards rituals and astrology in the ancient times. But<br />history shows a different picture. They were more action orientated<br />than us. Even after the sack of Tamilakam, you see it being very<br />prosperous in less than two hundred years time to rank as one of<br />world's most prosperous regions of those times.</p>

<p>To return to the Turkish invasion and the postmath:</p>
<p>The beginning of the downfall:<br />Kulasekhara Pandya had two sons. One of them, Sundara<br />Pandya, was by<br />the chief queen; the other, Vira Pandya, was by his favourite wife. He<br />was younger.<br />Kulasekara chose his favourite younger son, Vira<br />Pandya as the crown prince. The elder son, Sundara Pandya in a fit of<br />rage, murdered his father. He crowned himself as the Emperor at<br />Madurai. Vira Pandya was centred in Chola territory. The nobles of<br />Pandya country were angry at the murder and a big civil war started.<br />Sundara lost. So he went to Delhi. At that time, The Delhi Sulatanate<br />was ruled by the crook, Allauddin Khilji. His c-in-c, Malik Kafur was<br />already on an invasion of South India. He had subdued the Yadavas,<br />Kaakatiiyas and the KoysaLas. While he was receiving the surrender of<br />HoysaLa, Sundara's request for help came. Khilji ordered Kafur to<br />capture the Pandya country and make Sundara as Delhi's vassal. Kafur<br />came, saw, and destroyed. His main targets were the temples. Vira<br />Pandya ran away. Kafur went up to Rameswaram to stop the Singhalese<br />king from coming to help Vira Pandya. He asked the Arab-Tamils of<br />Vajranaadu to join him in fighting against Vira Pandya in the name of<br />religion. But they told Kafur that the Koran does not preach treachery<br />and betrayal of one's king.</p>
<p>After a while, Kafur returned back to Delhi. He took back with him<br />96000 maunds of gold and jewels loaded on 612 elephants.</p>
<p>A maund is equal to about 11.4 kilos.</p>
<p>20000 horses of the once powerful Pandyan cavalry also were taken away.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Tamilnadu was invaded and raided by<br />Khusrau Khan and Muhamed Bin Thuglaq. Both of them ravaged and looted<br />Tamilnadu, almost bone.</p>
<p>But a few decades later, Tamilnadu came under the reign of the<br />VijayaNagar Empire. In one of century, Tamilnadu became the main<br />source of income, man-power and power-base for the VijayaNagar Empire.<br />Vijayanagar came to be called as the richest country in the world,<br />by the Poruguese and other people who came here.<br />The Nayak kingdoms which followed the break-up of VijayaNagar were<br />also rich.<br />However hard Tamilnadu might have fallen economically, it always<br />bounced up with renewed vigour withinn a short space of time.<br />Thus was the riches-generating cabacities of the Tamisl?<br />So.....<br />Who made Tamilnadu poor?</p>
