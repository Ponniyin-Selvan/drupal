</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear Mr SPS</p>
<p>After I read your posting, I was curious to know about Narathamali / Vijayalaya choleeswaram and did a google search to find out this. </p>
<p>Beautiful set of pictures posted in this website about the 12 vishnus, the caves and the Vijayalaya Chooleeswaram temple.</p>
<p>for those who need a quick view of VC temple, you may see this link :<br /><a href="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html" title="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html">http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html</a> </p>
<p>There are about 35Pictures given in the website, for detail view:<br /><a href="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html" title="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html">http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html</a></p>
<p>The following info was also given over there : </p>
<p>Narthamalai is the modern corrupt form of its earlier more famous name "Nagarattar Malai" in the early mediaeval era when the hills were frequented byJaina ascetics and the habitat was a flourishing traders' settlemnt of international repute in contrast to the sleepy village of today. The area was ruled by Muttaraiyars, vassals of the Pallava monrachs of Kanchipuram.</p>
<p>Today, Narthamalai is approachable by road or rail. It is 36 km south of Trichi and 17 km north of Pudukottai on the Trichi-Karaikkudi rail link. The town proper is 4 km from the railway station. It is surrounded by seven or eight hills with ancient caves containing Jaina Architectural remnants. TheWeshtern hill is the most important among these. The gravelled approach road to the hill is about 1.5 km from the highway. The temple proper can be apprached only by ascending the gently sloping hill for a distance of 0.5 km.</p>
<p>There are two cave temples facing east and a later structural temple complex, Vijayalaya Choleeswaram, facing the caves. The larger and earlier Jaina cave on the north side has been converted later as a Vaishnava shrine and its ardhamandapa has about 12 standing friezes of Vishnu.</p>
<p>Outside the Vishnu graham (the older cave temple) is a large mukhamandapa (adhistana only) wherein the Sapta Matrukkal (seven divine mothers) are located in two congregations. A granite block of three depicting Kaumari, Brahmi and Maheswari is stationed on the south side of the entrance to the shrine, while a group of four Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda occupy thenorthern side of the entrance. In addition, a dvarapala and a Vinadhara Dakshinamurty can be seen on the south side of the entrance and another dvarapala on the right side. An unidentified large sculpture (Durga?) occupies the extreme southern slot.</p>
<p>On the south side of the original Jain cave, another cave shrine has been carved out in the rock. This temple is called "Paliyili Isvaram". On the kumudha of the mukhamandapa (foundation) of this temple is recorded a Pallava inscription of 862 A.D. in the seventh regnal year of Nrpatunga Varman. It proclaims that Sattan Paliyili, son of Videl Vidugu Muttaraiyar (the subordinate chieftain of the Pallava ruling over Narthamalai) constructed (altered the Jaina one?) the cave temple for Siva and his wife Paliyili Siriya Nangai constructed the mukhamandapa (adhistana only), Rishabha, Balipeeta etc. </p>
<p>On the east of the above two cave temples, in a vast expanse of gently rolling rock is located the "Vijayalaya Choleeswaram", the early structural temple of the period of Vijayalaya, the founder of the Chola dynasty. A Pandyan inscription of (1228 A.D.) Ko Maravarman Sundara Pandya Deva near the Jaina Cave on the rock details the privsions made for festivals, processions, Thiru Veethi Kuttu etc. for the Vijayalay Choleesvaram Udaiya Nayanar, the deity of the temple. There is also another fragmentary inscription of 1015 A.D. in the reign of Rajendra Deva I.</p>
<p>The Temple</p>
<p>The temple faces west and has the unusual arrangement of a circular cella (the omkara garbhagriha) within a square prakara. Above the cella and the prakara rises the vimana in four diminishing storeys (talas) of which the three lower ones are square and the uppermost circular, the whole surmounted by a dome shaped sikhara with a round kalasa on top. There is an enclosed mantapa in front with Pallava style pillars. Two dvarapalas, five feet tall, guard the entrance.</p>
<p>An epigraph obtained below the dvarapala on the north states that the temple was renovated by Muttaraiyan Mallan Vituman over the earlier weather-withered structure built by Muttaraiyan Ilangovadi. Thus it becomes clear that the original shrine (brick?) was a Pallava foundation of eighth century during the rule of Nandivarman and the rebuilt stone structure (Kal tali) belonged to the period of Vijayalaya Chola in the latter half of 9th century.</p>
<p>Round the main temple in the open yard are seven small sub-shrines built ofstone and all facing inwards in a typical early Chola style. Beautiful sculptures of Uma Sahithar and Vina Dhara Dakshinamurty belonging to the deva koshta on the griva of the main temple are now the Pudukkottai Museum.</p>
<p>The entire complex is now an archaeological monument.</p>
<p>Kamarasavalli Chaturvedimangalam</p>
<p>Again the same site has posted details about Karkotakesvaram (@ Kamarasavalli Chaturvedimangalam ), a temple built by Aditya Cholan I. The temple, nowmostly in ruins, contains some some <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  inscriptions too :</p>
<p>Locating the temple was not an easy task, as the old names and references are not in vogue any more</p>

<p>  Was speaking to my wife's grandpa - Sanskrit Scholar.</p>
<p>  Re Narathamalai 12 images (Vishnu) - he observed they should have been DWADASA ADITYA !</p>
<p>  Here is the link ::</p>
<p>  <a href="http://varahamihira.blogspot.com/2004/07/33-devas-pt-sanjay-rath.html" title="http://varahamihira.blogspot.com/2004/07/33-devas-pt-sanjay-rath.html">http://varahamihira.blogspot.com/2004/07/33-devas-pt-sanjay-rath.html</a></p>
<p>  Dwadasa Aditya </p>
<p>  Sathapatha Brahmana 14.16: <br />  Katame Aditya iti. Dwadasamasah samvatsarasya <br />  Aeta Adityah aete hidam sarvamadadaanayanti taddwididam sarvamadadaana yanti tasmaditya iti. </p>
<p>  Dwadasa means twelve and Masa means the month ? thus the Dwadasa (twelve) Aditya are the twelve months represented by the twelve signs in the zodiac. The month is variously defined in Jyotish and this specific reference indicates the motion of the during the period between two consecutive conjunctions with the Moon. This is the synodic month and is about 29.5 days, which for convenience is taken as 30 days. Since the average geo-centric motion of the Sun during 30 days is 30 degrees, this defines the Saura Masa (solar month) which is the third principle of Jyotish. Twelve such '30 degree motions' result in the Sun returning to its original position and this defines the Samvatsara or `solar year'. Thus, the third principle of Jyotish is that of time &amp; space which is defined by the Dwadasa Aditya (twelve signs of the zodiac with the Sun as their overlord). The solar month and solar year are the foundation of Vedic astrology and that further sub-divisions of time are to be determined based on solar motion. The word Samvatsara means `year' and specifically `solar year' as this is based on the Dwadasa Aditya.This knowledge is of vital importance in determining the period of influence of the planets called `dasa'. Often astrologers are bogged down with misconceptions about using the solar or lunar year or even other variously defined time periods. This indicates the lack of appreciation of this principle of time &amp; space relationship as defined by the Dwadasa Aditya. </p>
<p>  They are called Aditya as they are the distributors of food and all materials required for creation and sustenance (Dana) as well as inspiration, exhilaration, intoxication, sexual vitality and vigor (Mada). The Aditya arethe givers and everything comes from them. Thus, the twelve signs represent all the material forms of creation. <br />  ==========</p>

<p>    In the Naarthamalai complex there are two wonderful Kudaivarais near <br />    vijayalaya choleeswaram (which is structural temple).</p>
<p>    One is for shiva other for vishnu</p>
<p>    The main deity in the sacntum sanctorum of vishnu temple is missing <br />    (meaning it was not sculpted as a part and parcel of the kudaivarai)</p>
<p>    But in arthamantapa, there are 12 "vishnus" - all in similar poses ! <br />    all having shanka chakra abhaya and katiyavalambitha postures. (To <br />    those who are confused with this terminology it is same as <br />    thirupathi god with 4 hands and no garlands !)</p>
<p>    Obviously these are not "vishnus" because Vishnu is portrayed as a <br />    superior god singular entity.</p>
<p>    These are also not the 12 manifestations of vishnu - Madhava, <br />    trivikrama, madhusoodhana etc. Because each of these forms have <br />    different hand / weapon postures (all 12 can be seen in Belur <br />    chennakesava temple).</p>
<p>    I am not able to understand the significance. The kudaivarai is <br />    attributed to padhinen bhoomi nagarathar a merchantile community <br />    just like thisai ayirarathu munnutruvar who were famous in <br />    pudukkotai regions during vijayalaya muttaraiya times</p>
<p>    Thoughts welcome</p>

<p>    Dear Mr SPS</p>
<p>    After I read your posting, I was curious to know about  <br />    Narathamali / Vijayalaya choleeswaram and did a google search to  <br />    find out this.</p>
<p>    Beautiful set of pictures posted in this website about the 12  <br />    vishnus, the caves and the Vijayalaya Chooleeswaram temple.</p>
<p>    for those who need a quick view of VC temple, you may see this link :<br />    <a href="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html" title="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html">http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html</a></p>
<p>    There are about 35Pictures given in the website, for detail view:<br />    <a href="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html" title="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html">http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html</a></p>
<p>    The following info was also given over there :</p>
<p>    Narthamalai is the modern corrupt form of its earlier more famous  <br />    name "Nagarattar Malai" in the early mediaeval era when the hills  <br />    were frequented by Jaina ascetics and the habitat was a flourishing  <br />    traders' settlemnt of international repute in contrast to the  <br />    sleepy village of today. The area was ruled by Muttaraiyars,  <br />    vassals of the Pallava monrachs of Kanchipuram.</p>
<p>    Today, Narthamalai is approachable by road or rail. It is 36 km  <br />    south of Trichi and 17 km north of Pudukottai on the Trichi- <br />    Karaikkudi rail link. The town proper is 4 km from the railway  <br />    station. It is surrounded by seven or eight hills with ancient  <br />    caves containing Jaina Architectural remnants. The Weshtern hill is  <br />    the most important among these. The gravelled approach road to the  <br />    hill is about 1.5 km from the highway. The temple proper can be  <br />    apprached only by ascending the gently sloping hill for a distance  <br />    of 0.5 km.</p>
<p>    There are two cave temples facing east and a later structural  <br />    temple complex, Vijayalaya Choleeswaram, facing the caves. The  <br />    larger and earlier Jaina cave on the north side has been converted  <br />    later as a Vaishnava shrine and its ardhamandapa has about 12  <br />    standing friezes of Vishnu.</p>
<p>    Outside the Vishnu graham (the older cave temple) is a large  <br />    mukhamandapa (adhistana only) wherein the Sapta Matrukkal (seven  <br />    divine mothers) are located in two congregations. A granite block  <br />    of three depicting Kaumari, Brahmi and Maheswari is stationed on  <br />    the south side of the entrance to the shrine, while a group of four  <br />    Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda occupy the northern side of  <br />    the entrance. In addition, a dvarapala and a Vinadhara  <br />    Dakshinamurty can be seen on the south side of the entrance and  <br />    another dvarapala on the right side. An unidentified large  <br />    sculpture (Durga?) occupies the extreme southern slot.</p>
<p>    On the south side of the original Jain cave, another cave shrine  <br />    has been carved out in the rock. This temple is called "Paliyili  <br />    Isvaram". On the kumudha of the mukhamandapa (foundation) of this  <br />    temple is recorded a Pallava inscription of 862 A.D. in the seventh  <br />    regnal year of Nrpatunga Varman. It proclaims that Sattan Paliyili,  <br />    son of Videl Vidugu Muttaraiyar (the subordinate chieftain of the  <br />    Pallava ruling over Narthamalai) constructed (altered the Jaina  <br />    one?) the cave temple for Siva and his wife Paliyili Siriya Nangai  <br />    constructed the mukhamandapa (adhistana only), Rishabha, Balipeeta  <br />    etc.</p>
<p>    On the east of the above two cave temples, in a vast expanse of  <br />    gently rolling rock is located the "Vijayalaya Choleeswaram", the  <br />    early structural temple of the period of Vijayalaya, the founder of  <br />    the Chola dynasty. A Pandyan inscription of (1228 A.D.) Ko  <br />    Maravarman Sundara Pandya Deva near the Jaina Cave on the rock  <br />    details the privsions made for festivals, processions, Thiru Veethi  <br />    Kuttu etc. for the Vijayalay Choleesvaram Udaiya Nayanar, the deity  <br />    of the temple. There is also another fragmentary inscription of  <br />    1015 A.D. in the reign of Rajendra Deva I.</p>
<p>    The Temple</p>
<p>    The temple faces west and has the unusual arrangement of a circular  <br />    cella (the omkara garbhagriha) within a square prakara. Above the  <br />    cella and the prakara rises the vimana in four diminishing storeys  <br />    (talas) of which the three lower ones are square and the uppermost  <br />    circular, the whole surmounted by a dome shaped sikhara with a  <br />    round kalasa on top. There is an enclosed mantapa in front with  <br />    Pallava style pillars. Two dvarapalas, five feet tall, guard the  <br />    entrance.</p>
<p>    An epigraph obtained below the dvarapala on the north states that  <br />    the temple was renovated by Muttaraiyan Mallan Vituman over the  <br />    earlier weather-withered structure built by Muttaraiyan Ilangovadi.  <br />    Thus it becomes clear that the original shrine (brick?) was a  <br />    Pallava foundation of eighth century during the rule of Nandivarman  <br />    and the rebuilt stone structure (Kal tali) belonged to the period  <br />    of Vijayalaya Chola in the latter half of 9th century.</p>
<p>    Round the main temple in the open yard are seven small sub-shrines  <br />    built of stone and all facing inwards in a typical early Chola  <br />    style. Beautiful sculptures of Uma Sahithar and Vina Dhara  <br />    Dakshinamurty belonging to the deva koshta on the griva of the main  <br />    temple are now the Pudukkottai Museum.</p>
<p>    The entire complex is now an archaeological monument.</p>
<p>    Kamarasavalli Chaturvedimangalam</p>
<p>    Again the same site has posted details about Karkotakesvaram (@  <br />    Kamarasavalli Chaturvedimangalam ), a temple built by Aditya Cholan  <br />    I. The temple, now mostly in ruins, contains some some RRC  <br />    inscriptions too :</p>
<p>    Locating the temple was not an easy task, as the old names and  <br />    references are not in vogue any more</p>

<p>      Dear Gokul,</p>
<p>      Was speaking to my wife's grandpa - Sanskrit Scholar.</p>
<p>      Re Narathamalai 12 images (Vishnu) - he observed they should have  <br />    been DWADASA ADITYA !</p>
<p>      Here is the link ::</p>
<p>      <a href="http://varahamihira.blogspot.com/2004/07/33-devas-pt-sanjay-" title="http://varahamihira.blogspot.com/2004/07/33-devas-pt-sanjay-">http://varahamihira.blogspot.com/2004/07/33-devas-pt-sanjay-</a> <br />    rath.html</p>
<p>      Dwadasa Aditya</p>
<p>      Sathapatha Brahmana 14.16:<br />      Katame Aditya iti. Dwadasamasah samvatsarasya<br />      Aeta Adityah aete hidam sarvamadadaanayanti taddwididam  <br />    sarvamadadaana yanti tasmaditya iti.</p>
<p>      Dwadasa means twelve and Masa means the month ? thus the Dwadasa  <br />    (twelve) Aditya are the twelve months represented by the twelve  <br />    signs in the zodiac. The month is variously defined in Jyotish and  <br />    this specific reference indicates the motion of the during the  <br />    period between two consecutive conjunctions with the Moon. This is  <br />    the synodic month and is about 29.5 days, which for convenience is  <br />    taken as 30 days. Since the average geo-centric motion of the Sun  <br />    during 30 days is 30 degrees, this defines the Saura Masa (solar  <br />    month) which is the third principle of Jyotish. Twelve such '30  <br />    degree motions' result in the Sun returning to its original  <br />    position and this defines the Samvatsara or `solar year'. Thus, the  <br />    third principle of Jyotish is that of time &amp; space which is defined  <br />    by the Dwadasa Aditya (twelve signs of the zodiac with the Sun as  <br />    their overlord). The solar month and solar year are the foundation  <br />    of Vedic astrology and that further sub-divisions of time are to be  <br />    determined based on solar motion. The word Samvatsara means `year'  <br />    and specifically `solar year' as this is based on the Dwadasa  <br />    Aditya. This knowledge is of vital importance in determining the  <br />    period of influence of the planets called `dasa'. Often astrologers  <br />    are bogged down with misconceptions about using the solar or lunar  <br />    year or even other variously defined time periods. This indicates  <br />    the lack of appreciation of this principle of time &amp; space  <br />    relationship as defined by the Dwadasa Aditya.</p>
<p>      They are called Aditya as they are the distributors of food and  <br />    all materials required for creation and sustenance (Dana) as well  <br />    as inspiration, exhilaration, intoxication, sexual vitality and  <br />    vigor (Mada). The Aditya are the givers and everything comes from  <br />    them. Thus, the twelve signs represent all the material forms of  <br />    creation.<br />      ==========</p>

<p>        In the Naarthamalai complex there are two wonderful Kudaivarais  <br />    near<br />        vijayalaya choleeswaram (which is structural temple).</p>
<p>        One is for shiva other for vishnu</p>
<p>        The main deity in the sacntum sanctorum of vishnu temple is  <br />    missing<br />        (meaning it was not sculpted as a part and parcel of the  <br />    kudaivarai)</p>
<p>        But in arthamantapa, there are 12 "vishnus" - all in similar  <br />    poses !<br />        all having shanka chakra abhaya and katiyavalambitha postures. (To<br />        those who are confused with this terminology it is same as<br />        thirupathi god with 4 hands and no garlands !)</p>
<p>        Obviously these are not "vishnus" because Vishnu is portrayed as a<br />        superior god singular entity.</p>
<p>        These are also not the 12 manifestations of vishnu - Madhava,<br />        trivikrama, madhusoodhana etc. Because each of these forms have<br />        different hand / weapon postures (all 12 can be seen in Belur<br />        chennakesava temple).</p>
<p>        I am not able to understand the significance. The kudaivarai is<br />        attributed to padhinen bhoomi nagarathar a merchantile community<br />        just like thisai ayirarathu munnutruvar who were famous in<br />        pudukkotai regions during vijayalaya muttaraiya times</p>
<p>        Thoughts welcome</p>

<p>  Dear Mr SPS</p>
<p>  After I read your posting, I was curious to know about=20=20<br />  Narathamali / Vijayalaya choleeswaram and did a google search to=20=20<br />  find out this.</p>
<p>  Beautiful set of pictures posted in this website about the 12=20=20<br />  vishnus, the caves and the Vijayalaya Chooleeswaram temple.</p>
<p>  for those who need a quick view of VC temple, you may see this link :<br />  <a href="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html" title="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html">http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html</a></p>
<p>  There are about 35Pictures given in the website, for detail view:<br />  <a href="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html" title="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html">http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html</a></p>
<p>  The following info was also given over there :</p>
<p>  Narthamalai is the modern corrupt form of its earlier more famous=20=20<br />  name "Nagarattar Malai" in the early mediaeval era when the hills=20=20<br />  were frequented by Jaina ascetics and the habitat was a flourishing=20=20<br />  traders' settlemnt of international repute in contrast to the=20=20<br />  sleepy village of today. The area was ruled by Muttaraiyars,=20=20<br />  vassals of the Pallava monrachs of Kanchipuram.</p>
<p>  Today, Narthamalai is approachable by road or rail. It is 36 km=20=20<br />  south of Trichi and 17 km north of Pudukottai on the Trichi-=20<br />  Karaikkudi rail link. The town proper is 4 km from the railway=20=20<br />  station. It is surrounded by seven or eight hills with ancient=20=20<br />  caves containing Jaina Architectural remnants. The Weshtern hill is=20=20<br />  the most important among these. The gravelled approach road to the=20=20<br />  hill is about 1.5 km from the highway. The temple proper can be=20=20<br />  apprached only by ascending the gently sloping hill for a distance=20=20<br />  of 0.5 km.</p>
<p>  There are two cave temples facing east and a later structural=20=20<br />  temple complex, Vijayalaya Choleeswaram, facing the caves. The=20=20<br />  larger and earlier Jaina cave on the north side has been converted=20=20<br />  later as a Vaishnava shrine and its ardhamandapa has about 12=20=20<br />  standing friezes of Vishnu.</p>
<p>  Outside the Vishnu graham (the older cave temple) is a large=20=20<br />  mukhamandapa (adhistana only) wherein the Sapta Matrukkal (seven=20=20<br />  divine mothers) are located in two congregations. A granite block=20=20<br />  of three depicting Kaumari, Brahmi and Maheswari is stationed on=20=20<br />  the south side of the entrance to the shrine, while a group of four=20=20<br />  Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda occupy the northern side of=20=20<br />  the entrance. In addition, a dvarapala and a Vinadhara=20=20<br />  Dakshinamurty can be seen on the south side of the entrance and=20=20<br />  another dvarapala on the right side. An unidentified large=20=20<br />  sculpture (Durga?) occupies the extreme southern slot.</p>
<p>  On the south side of the original Jain cave, another cave shrine=20=20<br />  has been carved out in the rock. This temple is called "Paliyili=20=20<br />  Isvaram". On the kumudha of the mukhamandapa (foundation) of this=20=20<br />  temple is recorded a Pallava inscription of 862 A.D. in the seventh=20=20<br />  regnal year of Nrpatunga Varman. It proclaims that Sattan Paliyili,=20=20<br />  son of Videl Vidugu Muttaraiyar (the subordinate chieftain of the=20=20<br />  Pallava ruling over Narthamalai) constructed (altered the Jaina=20=20<br />  one?) the cave temple for Siva and his wife Paliyili Siriya Nangai=20=20<br />  constructed the mukhamandapa (adhistana only), Rishabha, Balipeeta=20=20<br />  etc.</p>
<p>  On the east of the above two cave temples, in a vast expanse of=20=20<br />  gently rolling rock is located the "Vijayalaya Choleeswaram", the=20=20<br />  early structural temple of the period of Vijayalaya, the founder of=20=20<br />  the Chola dynasty. A Pandyan inscription of (1228 A.D.) Ko=20=20<br />  Maravarman Sundara Pandya Deva near the Jaina Cave on the rock=20=20<br />  details the privsions made for festivals, processions, Thiru Veethi=20=20<br />  Kuttu etc. for the Vijayalay Choleesvaram Udaiya Nayanar, the deity=20=20<br />  of the temple. There is also another fragmentary inscription of=20=20<br />  1015 A.D. in the reign of Rajendra Deva I.</p>
<p>  The Temple</p>
<p>  The temple faces west and has the unusual arrangement of a circular=20=20<br />  cella (the omkara garbhagriha) within a square prakara. Above the=20=20<br />  cella and the prakara rises the vimana in four diminishing storeys=20=20<br />  (talas) of which the three lower ones are square and the uppermost=20=20<br />  circular, the whole surmounted by a dome shaped sikhara with a=20=20<br />  round kalasa on top. There is an enclosed mantapa in front with=20=20<br />  Pallava style pillars. Two dvarapalas, five feet tall, guard the=20=20<br />  entrance.</p>
<p>  An epigraph obtained below the dvarapala on the north states that=20=20<br />  the temple was renovated by Muttaraiyan Mallan Vituman over the=20=20<br />  earlier weather-withered structure built by Muttaraiyan Ilangovadi.=20=20<br />  Thus it becomes clear that the original shrine (brick?) was a=20=20<br />  Pallava foundation of eighth century during the rule of Nandivarman=20=20<br />  and the rebuilt stone structure (Kal tali) belonged to the period=20=20<br />  of Vijayalaya Chola in the latter half of 9th century.</p>
<p>  Round the main temple in the open yard are seven small sub-shrines=20=20<br />  built of stone and all facing inwards in a typical early Chola=20=20<br />  style. Beautiful sculptures of Uma Sahithar and Vina Dhara=20=20<br />  Dakshinamurty belonging to the deva koshta on the griva of the main=20=20<br />  temple are now the Pudukkottai Museum.</p>
<p>  The entire complex is now an archaeological monument.</p>
<p>  Kamarasavalli Chaturvedimangalam</p>
<p>  Again the same site has posted details about Karkotakesvaram (@=20=20<br />  Kamarasavalli Chaturvedimangalam ), a temple built by Aditya Cholan=20=20<br />  I. The temple, now mostly in ruins, contains some some RRC=20=20<br />  inscriptions too :</p>
<p>  Locating the temple was not an easy task, as the old names and=20=20<br />  references are not in vogue any more</p>

<p>    Dear Gokul,</p>
<p>    Was speaking to my wife's grandpa - Sanskrit Scholar.</p>
<p>    Re Narathamalai 12 images (Vishnu) - he observed they should have=20=20<br />  been DWADASA ADITYA !</p>
<p>    Here is the link ::</p>
<p>    <a href="http://varahamihira.blogspot.com/2004/07/33-devas-pt-sanjay-=20" title="http://varahamihira.blogspot.com/2004/07/33-devas-pt-sanjay-=20">http://varahamihira.blogspot.com/2004/07/33-devas-pt-sanjay-=20</a><br />  rath.html</p>
<p>    Dwadasa Aditya</p>
<p>    Sathapatha Brahmana 14.16:<br />    Katame Aditya iti. Dwadasamasah samvatsarasya<br />    Aeta Adityah aete hidam sarvamadadaanayanti taddwididam=20=20<br />  sarvamadadaana yanti tasmaditya iti.</p>
<p>    Dwadasa means twelve and Masa means the month =96 thus the Dwadasa=20=20<br />  (twelve) Aditya are the twelve months represented by the twelve=20=20<br />  signs in the zodiac. The month is variously defined in Jyotish and=20=20<br />  this specific reference indicates the motion of the during the=20=20<br />  period between two consecutive conjunctions with the Moon. This is=20=20<br />  the synodic month and is about 29.5 days, which for convenience is=20=20<br />  taken as 30 days. Since the average geo-centric motion of the Sun=20=20<br />  during 30 days is 30 degrees, this defines the Saura Masa (solar=20=20<br />  month) which is the third principle of Jyotish. Twelve such '30=20=20<br />  degree motions' result in the Sun returning to its original=20=20<br />  position and this defines the Samvatsara or `solar year'. Thus, the=20=20<br />  third principle of Jyotish is that of time &amp; space which is defined=20=20<br />  by the Dwadasa Aditya (twelve signs of the zodiac with the Sun as=20=20<br />  their overlord). The solar month and solar year are the foundation=20=20<br />  of Vedic astrology and that further sub-divisions of time are to be=20=20<br />  determined based on solar motion. The word Samvatsara means `year'=20=20<br />  and specifically `solar year' as this is based on the Dwadasa=20=20<br />  Aditya. This knowledge is of vital importance in determining the=20=20<br />  period of influence of the planets called `dasa'. Often astrologers=20=20<br />  are bogged down with misconceptions about using the solar or lunar=20=20<br />  year or even other variously defined time periods. This indicates=20=20<br />  the lack of appreciation of this principle of time &amp; space=20=20<br />  relationship as defined by the Dwadasa Aditya.</p>
<p>    They are called Aditya as they are the distributors of food and=20=20<br />  all materials required for creation and sustenance (Dana) as well=20=20<br />  as inspiration, exhilaration, intoxication, sexual vitality and=20=20<br />  vigor (Mada). The Aditya are the givers and everything comes from=20=20<br />  them. Thus, the twelve signs represent all the material forms of=20=20<br />  creation.<br />    =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D</p>

<p>      In the Naarthamalai complex there are two wonderful Kudaivarais=20=20<br />  near<br />      vijayalaya choleeswaram (which is structural temple).</p>
<p>      One is for shiva other for vishnu</p>
<p>      The main deity in the sacntum sanctorum of vishnu temple is=20=20<br />  missing<br />      (meaning it was not sculpted as a part and parcel of the=20=20<br />  kudaivarai)</p>
<p>      But in arthamantapa, there are 12 "vishnus" - all in similar=20=20<br />  poses !<br />      all having shanka chakra abhaya and katiyavalambitha postures. (To<br />      those who are confused with this terminology it is same as<br />      thirupathi god with 4 hands and no garlands !)</p>
<p>      Obviously these are not "vishnus" because Vishnu is portrayed as a<br />      superior god singular entity.</p>
<p>      These are also not the 12 manifestations of vishnu - Madhava,<br />      trivikrama, madhusoodhana etc. Because each of these forms have<br />      different hand / weapon postures (all 12 can be seen in Belur<br />      chennakesava temple).</p>
<p>      I am not able to understand the significance. The kudaivarai is<br />      attributed to padhinen bhoomi nagarathar a merchantile community<br />      just like thisai ayirarathu munnutruvar who were famous in<br />      pudukkotai regions during vijayalaya muttaraiya times</p>
<p>      Thoughts welcome</p>

<p>      Dear Mr SPS</p>
<p>      After I read your posting, I was curious to know about Narathamali / Vijayalaya choleeswaram and did a google search to find out this. </p>
<p>      Beautiful set of pictures posted in this website about the 12 vishnus, the caves and the Vijayalaya Chooleeswaram temple.</p>
<p>      for those who need a quick view of VC temple, you may see this link :<br />      <a href="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html" title="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html">http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html</a> </p>
<p>      There are about 35Pictures given in the website, for detail view:<br />      <a href="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html" title="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html">http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html</a></p>
<p>      The following info was also given over there : </p>
<p>      Narthamalai is the modern corrupt form of its earlier more famous name "Nagarattar Malai" in the early mediaeval era when the hills were frequented by Jaina ascetics and the habitat was a flourishing traders' settlemnt of international repute in contrast to the sleepy village of today. The area was ruled by Muttaraiyars, vassals of the Pallava monrachs of Kanchipuram.</p>
<p>      Today, Narthamalai is approachable by road or rail. It is 36 km southof Trichi and 17 km north of Pudukottai on the Trichi-Karaikkudi rail link. The town proper is 4 km from the railway station. It is surrounded by seven or eight hills with ancient caves containing Jaina Architectural remnants. The Weshtern hill is the most important among these. The gravelled approach road to the hill is about 1.5 km from the highway. The temple proper can be apprached only by ascending the gently sloping hill for a distance of 0.5 km.</p>
<p>      There are two cave temples facing east and a later structural temple complex, Vijayalaya Choleeswaram, facing the caves. The larger and earlier Jaina cave on the north side has been converted later as a Vaishnava shrineand its ardhamandapa has about 12 standing friezes of Vishnu.</p>
<p>      Outside the Vishnu graham (the older cave temple) is a large mukhamandapa (adhistana only) wherein the Sapta Matrukkal (seven divine mothers) are located in two congregations. A granite block of three depicting Kaumari,Brahmi and Maheswari is stationed on the south side of the entrance to theshrine, while a group of four Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda occupy the northern side of the entrance. In addition, a dvarapala and a Vinadhara Dakshinamurty can be seen on the south side of the entrance and anotherdvarapala on the right side. An unidentified large sculpture (Durga?) occupies the extreme southern slot.</p>
<p>      On the south side of the original Jain cave, another cave shrine has been carved out in the rock. This temple is called "Paliyili Isvaram". On the kumudha of the mukhamandapa (foundation) of this temple is recorded a Pallava inscription of 862 A.D. in the seventh regnal year of Nrpatunga Varman. It proclaims that Sattan Paliyili, son of Videl Vidugu Muttaraiyar (the subordinate chieftain of the Pallava ruling over Narthamalai) constructed (altered the Jaina one?) the cave temple for Siva and his wife Paliyili Siriya Nangai constructed the mukhamandapa (adhistana only), Rishabha, Balipeeta etc. </p>
<p>      On the east of the above two cave temples, in a vast expanse of gently rolling rock is located the "Vijayalaya Choleeswaram", the early structural temple of the period of Vijayalaya, the founder of the Chola dynasty. A Pandyan inscription of (1228 A.D.) Ko Maravarman Sundara Pandya Deva near the Jaina Cave on the rock details the privsions made for festivals, processions, Thiru Veethi Kuttu etc. for the Vijayalay Choleesvaram Udaiya Nayanar, the deity of the temple. There is also another fragmentary inscription of1015 A.D. in the reign of Rajendra Deva I.</p>
<p>      The Temple</p>
<p>      The temple faces west and has the unusual arrangement of a circular cella (the omkara garbhagriha) within a square prakara. Above the cella and the prakara rises the vimana in four diminishing storeys (talas) of which the three lower ones are square and the uppermost circular, the whole surmounted by a dome shaped sikhara with a round kalasa on top. There is an enclosed mantapa in front with Pallava style pillars. Two dvarapalas, five feet tall, guard the entrance.</p>
<p>      An epigraph obtained below the dvarapala on the north states that thetemple was renovated by Muttaraiyan Mallan Vituman over the earlier weather-withered structure built by Muttaraiyan Ilangovadi. Thus it becomes clearthat the original shrine (brick?) was a Pallava foundation of eighth century during the rule of Nandivarman and the rebuilt stone structure (Kal tali) belonged to the period of Vijayalaya Chola in the latter half of 9th century.</p>
<p>      Round the main temple in the open yard are seven small sub-shrines built of stone and all facing inwards in a typical early Chola style. Beautiful sculptures of Uma Sahithar and Vina Dhara Dakshinamurty belonging to thedeva koshta on the griva of the main temple are now the Pudukkottai Museum.</p>
<p>      The entire complex is now an archaeological monument.</p>

<p>      Again the same site has posted details about Karkotakesvaram (@ Kamarasavalli Chaturvedimangalam ), a temple built by Aditya Cholan I. The temple, now mostly in ruins, contains some some RRC inscriptions too :</p>
<p>      Locating the temple was not an easy task, as the old names and references are not in vogue any more</p>

<p>        Re Narathamalai 12 images (Vishnu) - he observed they should have been DWADASA ADITYA !</p>

<p>        Dwadasa Aditya </p>
<p>        Sathapatha Brahmana 14.16: <br />        Katame Aditya iti. Dwadasamasah samvatsarasya <br />        Aeta Adityah aete hidam sarvamadadaanayanti taddwididam sarvamadadaana yanti tasmaditya iti. </p>
<p>        Dwadasa means twelve and Masa means the month ? thus the Dwadasa (twelve) Aditya are the twelve months represented by the twelve signs in the zodiac. The month is variously defined in Jyotish and this specific reference indicates the motion of the during the period between two consecutive conjunctions with the Moon. This is the synodic month and is about 29.5 days,which for convenience is taken as 30 days. Since the average geo-centric motion of the Sun during 30 days is 30 degrees, this defines the Saura Masa (solar month) which is the third principle of Jyotish. Twelve such '30 degree motions' result in the Sun returning to its original position and this defines the Samvatsara or `solar year'. Thus, the third principle of Jyotishis that of time &amp; space which is defined by the Dwadasa Aditya (twelve signs of the zodiac with the Sun as their overlord). The solar month and solaryear are the foundation of Vedic astrology and that further sub-divisions of time are to be determined based on solar motion. The word Samvatsara means `year' and specifically `solar year' as this is based on the Dwadasa Aditya. This knowledge is of vital importance in determining the period of influence of the planets called `dasa'. Often astrologers are bogged down withmisconceptions about using the solar or lunar year or even other variouslydefined time periods. This indicates the lack of appreciation of this principle of time &amp; space relationship as defined by the Dwadasa Aditya. </p>
<p>        They are called Aditya as they are the distributors of food and all materials required for creation and sustenance (Dana) as well as inspiration, exhilaration, intoxication, sexual vitality and vigor (Mada). The Aditya are the givers and everything comes from them. Thus, the twelve signs represent all the material forms of creation. <br />        ==========</p>

<p>          In the Naarthamalai complex there are two wonderful Kudaivarais near <br />          vijayalaya choleeswaram (which is structural temple).</p>
<p>          One is for shiva other for vishnu</p>
<p>          The main deity in the sacntum sanctorum of vishnu temple is missing <br />          (meaning it was not sculpted as a part and parcel of the kudaivarai)</p>
<p>          But in arthamantapa, there are 12 "vishnus" - all in similar poses ! <br />          all having shanka chakra abhaya and katiyavalambitha postures. (To <br />          those who are confused with this terminology it is same as <br />          thirupathi god with 4 hands and no garlands !)</p>
<p>          Obviously these are not "vishnus" because Vishnu is portrayed as a <br />          superior god singular entity.</p>
<p>          These are also not the 12 manifestations of vishnu - Madhava, <br />          trivikrama, madhusoodhana etc. Because each of these forms have <br />          different hand / weapon postures (all 12 can be seen in Belur <br />          chennakesava temple).</p>
<p>          I am not able to understand the significance. The kudaivarai is <br />          attributed to padhinen bhoomi nagarathar a merchantile community <br />          just like thisai ayirarathu munnutruvar who were famous in <br />          pudukkotai regions during vijayalaya muttaraiya times</p>
<p>          Thoughts welcome</p>

Thus, the third principle of Jyotish is that of time &amp; space which is defined by the Dwadasa Aditya (twelve signsof the zodiac with the Sun as their overlord). The solar month and solar year are the foundation of Vedic astrology and that further sub-divisions oftime are to be determined based on solar motion. The word Samvatsara means`year' and specifically `solar year' as this is based on the Dwadasa Aditya. This knowledge is of vital importance in determining the period of influence of the planets called `dasa'. Often astrologers are bogged down with misconceptions about using the solar or lunar year or even other variously defined time periods. This indicates the lack of appreciation of this principle of time &amp; space relationship as defined by the Dwadasa Aditya. </p>
<p>      They are called Aditya as they are the distributors of food and all materials required for creation and sustenance (Dana) as well as inspiration, exhilaration, intoxication, sexual vitality and vigor (Mada). The Adityaare the givers and everything comes from them. Thus, the twelve signs represent all the material forms of creation. <br />      ==========</p>

<p>    Dear Mr SPS</p>
<p>    After I read your posting, I was curious to know about Narathamali / Vijayalaya choleeswaram and did a google search to find out this. </p>
<p>    Beautiful set of pictures posted in this website about the 12 vishnus, the caves and the Vijayalaya Chooleeswaram temple.</p>
<p>    for those who need a quick view of VC temple, you may see this link :<br />    <a href="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html" title="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html">http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html</a> </p>
<p>    There are about 35Pictures given in the website, for detail view:<br />    <a href="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html" title="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html">http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html</a></p>
<p>    The following info was also given over there : </p>
<p>    Narthamalai is the modern corrupt form of its earlier more famous name "Nagarattar Malai" in the early mediaeval era when the hills were frequented by Jaina ascetics and the habitat was a flourishing traders' settlemnt ofinternational repute in contrast to the sleepy village of today. The area was ruled by Muttaraiyars, vassals of the Pallava monrachs of Kanchipuram.</p>
<p>    Today, Narthamalai is approachable by road or rail. It is 36 km south of Trichi and 17 km north of Pudukottai on the Trichi-Karaikkudi rail link. The town proper is 4 km from the railway station. It is surrounded by sevenor eight hills with ancient caves containing Jaina Architectural remnants.The Weshtern hill is the most important among these. The gravelled approach road to the hill is about 1.5 km from the highway. The temple proper can be apprached only by ascending the gently sloping hill for a distance of 0.5 km.</p>
<p>    There are two cave temples facing east and a later structural temple complex, Vijayalaya Choleeswaram, facing the caves. The larger and earlier Jaina cave on the north side has been converted later as a Vaishnava shrine and its ardhamandapa has about 12 standing friezes of Vishnu.</p>
<p>    Outside the Vishnu graham (the older cave temple) is a large mukhamandapa (adhistana only) wherein the Sapta Matrukkal (seven divine mothers) are located in two congregations. A granite block of three depicting Kaumari, Brahmi and Maheswari is stationed on the south side of the entrance to the shrine, while a group of four Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda occupythe northern side of the entrance. In addition, a dvarapala and a Vinadhara Dakshinamurty can be seen on the south side of the entrance and another dvarapala on the right side. An unidentified large sculpture (Durga?) occupies the extreme southern slot.</p>
<p>    On the south side of the original Jain cave, another cave shrine has been carved out in the rock. This temple is called "Paliyili Isvaram". On thekumudha of the mukhamandapa (foundation) of this temple is recorded a Pallava inscription of 862 A.D. in the seventh regnal year of Nrpatunga Varman.It proclaims that Sattan Paliyili, son of Videl Vidugu Muttaraiyar (the subordinate chieftain of the Pallava ruling over Narthamalai) constructed (altered the Jaina one?) the cave temple for Siva and his wife Paliyili SiriyaNangai constructed the mukhamandapa (adhistana only), Rishabha, Balipeeta etc. </p>
<p>    On the east of the above two cave temples, in a vast expanse of gently rolling rock is located the "Vijayalaya Choleeswaram", the early structuraltemple of the period of Vijayalaya, the founder of the Chola dynasty. A Pandyan inscription of (1228 A.D.) Ko Maravarman Sundara Pandya Deva near theJaina Cave on the rock details the privsions made for festivals, processions, Thiru Veethi Kuttu etc. for the Vijayalay Choleesvaram Udaiya Nayanar, the deity of the temple. There is also another fragmentary inscription of 1015 A.D. in the reign of Rajendra Deva I.</p>
<p>    The Temple</p>
<p>    The temple faces west and has the unusual arrangement of a circular cella (the omkara garbhagriha) within a square prakara. Above the cella and the prakara rises the vimana in four diminishing storeys (talas) of which thethree lower ones are square and the uppermost circular, the whole surmounted by a dome shaped sikhara with a round kalasa on top. There is an enclosed mantapa in front with Pallava style pillars. Two dvarapalas, five feet tall, guard the entrance.</p>
<p>    An epigraph obtained below the dvarapala on the north states that the temple was renovated by Muttaraiyan Mallan Vituman over the earlier weather-withered structure built by Muttaraiyan Ilangovadi. Thus it becomes clear that the original shrine (brick?) was a Pallava foundation of eighth centuryduring the rule of Nandivarman and the rebuilt stone structure (Kal tali) belonged to the period of Vijayalaya Chola in the latter half of 9th century.</p>
<p>    Round the main temple in the open yard are seven small sub-shrines built of stone and all facing inwards in a typical early Chola style. Beautifulsculptures of Uma Sahithar and Vina Dhara Dakshinamurty belonging to the deva koshta on the griva of the main temple are now the Pudukkottai Museum.</p>
<p>    The entire complex is now an archaeological monument.</p>
<p>    Kamarasavalli Chaturvedimangalam</p>
<p>    Again the same site has posted details about Karkotakesvaram (@ Kamarasavalli Chaturvedimangalam ), a temple built by Aditya Cholan I. The temple,now mostly in ruins, contains some some RRC inscriptions too :</p>
<p>    Locating the temple was not an easy task, as the old names and references are not in vogue any more</p>

<p>      Dwadasa means twelve and Masa means the month ? thus the Dwadasa (twelve) Aditya are the twelve months represented by the twelve signs in the zodiac. The month is variously defined in Jyotish and this specific referenceindicates the motion of the during the period between two consecutive conjunctions with the Moon. This is the synodic month and is about 29.5 days, which for convenience is taken as 30 days. Since the average geo-centric motion of the Sun during 30 days is 30 degrees, this defines the Saura Masa (solar month) which is the third principle of Jyotish. Twelve such '30 degreemotions' result in the Sun returning to its original position and this defines the Samvatsara or `solar year'.

<blockquote><p>  Dear Mr SPS</p>
<p>  After I read your posting, I was curious to know about Narathamali / Vijayalaya choleeswaram and did a google search to find out this. </p>
<p>  Beautiful set of pictures posted in this website about the 12 vishnus, the caves and the Vijayalaya Chooleeswaram temple.</p>
<p>  for those who need a quick view of VC temple, you may see this link :<br />  <a href="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html" title="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html">http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/source/17.html</a> </p>
<p>  There are about 35Pictures given in the website, for detail view:<br />  <a href="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html" title="http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html">http://www.ola.in/galleries/Narthamalai/index.html</a></p>
<p>  The following info was also given over there : </p>
<p>  Narthamalai is the modern corrupt form of its earlier more famous name "Nagarattar Malai" in the early mediaeval era when the hills were frequented by Jaina ascetics and the habitat was a flourishing traders' settlemnt of international repute in contrast to the sleepy village of today. The area was ruled by Muttaraiyars, vassals of the Pallava monrachs of Kanchipuram.</p>
<p>  Today, Narthamalai is approachable by road or rail. It is 36 km south of Trichi and 17 km north of Pudukottai on the Trichi-Karaikkudi rail link. The town proper is 4 km from the railway station. It is surrounded by seven or eight hills with ancient caves containing Jaina Architectural remnants. The Weshtern hill is the most important among these. The gravelled approach road to the hill is about 1.5 km from the highway. The temple proper can beapprached only by ascending the gently sloping hill for a distance of 0.5 km.</p>
<p>  There are two cave temples facing east and a later structural temple complex, Vijayalaya Choleeswaram, facing the caves. The larger and earlier Jaina cave on the north side has been converted later as a Vaishnava shrine andits ardhamandapa has about 12 standing friezes of Vishnu.</p>
<p>  Outside the Vishnu graham (the older cave temple) is a large mukhamandapa(adhistana only) wherein the Sapta Matrukkal (seven divine mothers) are located in two congregations. A granite block of three depicting Kaumari, Brahmi and Maheswari is stationed on the south side of the entrance to the shrine, while a group of four Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda occupy the northern side of the entrance. In addition, a dvarapala and a Vinadhara Dakshinamurty can be seen on the south side of the entrance and another dvarapala on the right side. An unidentified large sculpture (Durga?) occupiesthe extreme southern slot.</p>
<p>  On the south side of the original Jain cave, another cave shrine has beencarved out in the rock. This temple is called "Paliyili Isvaram". On the kumudha of the mukhamandapa (foundation) of this temple is recorded a Pallava inscription of 862 A.D. in the seventh regnal year of Nrpatunga Varman. It proclaims that Sattan Paliyili, son of Videl Vidugu Muttaraiyar (the subordinate chieftain of the Pallava ruling over Narthamalai) constructed (altered the Jaina one?) the cave temple for Siva and his wife Paliyili Siriya Nangai constructed the mukhamandapa (adhistana only), Rishabha, Balipeeta etc. </p>
<p>  On the east of the above two cave temples, in a vast expanse of gently rolling rock is located the "Vijayalaya Choleeswaram", the early structural temple of the period of Vijayalaya, the founder of the Chola dynasty. A Pandyan inscription of (1228 A.D.) Ko Maravarman Sundara Pandya Deva near the Jaina Cave on the rock details the privsions made for festivals, processions, Thiru Veethi Kuttu etc. for the Vijayalay Choleesvaram Udaiya Nayanar, the deity of the temple. There is also another fragmentary inscription of 1015 A.D. in the reign of Rajendra Deva I.</p>
<p>  The Temple</p>
<p>  The temple faces west and has the unusual arrangement of a circular cella(the omkara garbhagriha) within a square prakara. Above the cella and the prakara rises the vimana in four diminishing storeys (talas) of which the three lower ones are square and the uppermost circular, the whole surmountedby a dome shaped sikhara with a round kalasa on top. There is an enclosed mantapa in front with Pallava style pillars. Two dvarapalas, five feet tall, guard the entrance.</p>
<p>  An epigraph obtained below the dvarapala on the north states that the temple was renovated by Muttaraiyan Mallan Vituman over the earlier weather-withered structure built by Muttaraiyan Ilangovadi. Thus it becomes clear that the original shrine (brick?) was a Pallava foundation of eighth century during the rule of Nandivarman and the rebuilt stone structure (Kal tali) belonged to the period of Vijayalaya Chola in the latter half of 9th century.</p>
<p>  Round the main temple in the open yard are seven small sub-shrines built of stone and all facing inwards in a typical early Chola style. Beautiful sculptures of Uma Sahithar and Vina Dhara Dakshinamurty belonging to the deva koshta on the griva of the main temple are now the Pudukkottai Museum.</p>
<p>  The entire complex is now an archaeological monument.</p>
<p>  Kamarasavalli Chaturvedimangalam</p>
<p>  Again the same site has posted details about Karkotakesvaram (@ Kamarasavalli Chaturvedimangalam ), a temple built by Aditya Cholan I. The temple, now mostly in ruins, contains some some RRC inscriptions too :</p>
<p>  Locating the temple was not an easy task, as the old names and referencesare not in vogue any more</p>

<p>    Dear Gokul,</p>
<p>    Was speaking to my wife's grandpa - Sanskrit Scholar.</p>
<p>    Re Narathamalai 12 images (Vishnu) - he observed they should have been DWADASA ADITYA !</p>
<p>    Here is the link ::</p>
<p>    <a href="http://varahamihira.blogspot.com/2004/07/33-devas-pt-sanjay-rath.html" title="http://varahamihira.blogspot.com/2004/07/33-devas-pt-sanjay-rath.html">http://varahamihira.blogspot.com/2004/07/33-devas-pt-sanjay-rath.html</a></p>
<p>    Dwadasa Aditya </p>
<p>    Sathapatha Brahmana 14.16: <br />    Katame Aditya iti. Dwadasamasah samvatsarasya <br />    Aeta Adityah aete hidam sarvamadadaanayanti taddwididam sarvamadadaana yanti tasmaditya iti. </p>
<p>    Dwadasa means twelve and Masa means the month ? thus the Dwadasa (twelve) Aditya are the twelve months represented by the twelve signs in the zodiac. The month is variously defined in Jyotish and this specific reference indicates the motion of the during the period between two consecutive conjunctions with the Moon. This is the synodic month and is about 29.5 days, which for convenience is taken as 30 days. Since the average geo-centric motion of the Sun during 30 days is 30 degrees, this defines the Saura Masa (solar month) which is the third principle of Jyotish. Twelve such '30 degree motions' result in the Sun returning to its original position and this defines the Samvatsara or `solar year'. Thus, the third principle of Jyotish is that of time &amp; space which is defined by the Dwadasa Aditya (twelve signs of the zodiac with the Sun as their overlord). The solar month and solar year are the foundation of Vedic astrology and that further sub-divisions of time are to be determined based on solar motion. The word Samvatsara means `year' and specifically `solar year' as this is based on the Dwadasa Aditya.This knowledge is of vital importance in determining the period of influence of the planets called `dasa'. Often astrologers are bogged down with misconceptions about using the solar or lunar year or even other variously defined time periods. This indicates the lack of appreciation of this principle of time &amp; space relationship as defined by the Dwadasa Aditya. </p>
<p>    They are called Aditya as they are the distributors of food and all materials required for creation and sustenance (Dana) as well as inspiration,exhilaration, intoxication, sexual vitality and vigor (Mada). The Aditya are the givers and everything comes from them. Thus, the twelve signs represent all the material forms of creation. <br />    ==========</p>

<p>    --- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "S.Gokul" <seshadrigokul@  wrotein 2006 :</p>
<p>      In the Naarthamalai complex there are two wonderful Kudaivarais near <br />      vijayalaya choleeswaram (which is structural temple).</p>
<p>      One is for shiva other for vishnu</p>
<p>      The main deity in the sacntum sanctorum of vishnu temple is missing <br />      (meaning it was not sculpted as a part and parcel of the kudaivarai)</p>
<p>      But in arthamantapa, there are 12 "vishnus" - all in similar poses ! <br />      all having shanka chakra abhaya and katiyavalambitha postures. (To <br />      those who are confused with this terminology it is same as <br />      thirupathi god with 4 hands and no garlands !)</p>
<p>      Obviously these are not "vishnus" because Vishnu is portrayed as a <br />      superior god singular entity.</p>
<p>      These are also not the 12 manifestations of vishnu - Madhava, <br />      trivikrama, madhusoodhana etc. Because each of these forms have <br />      different hand / weapon postures (all 12 can be seen in Belur <br />      chennakesava temple).</p>
<p>      I am not able to understand the significance. The kudaivarai is <br />      attributed to padhinen bhoomi nagarathar a merchantile community <br />      just like thisai ayirarathu munnutruvar who were famous in <br />      pudukkotai regions during vijayalaya muttaraiya times</p>
<p>      Thoughts welcome</p>
