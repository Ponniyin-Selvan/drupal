</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>1941 was a eventful year in kalki's life.<br />almost like fiction</p>
<p>1940- 31st december he received a letter from mahatma gandhi granting <br />him permission to do the 'thani nabar sathyagraham"</p>
<p>on the same day he was fired from ananda vikadan where he had worked <br />for 9 years.<br />jan 1st 1941 sent in his resignation letter.</p>
<p>soon he met with sadasivam in thiruvaiyaru( when does the thyaga <br />bramhotsam happen?)</p>
<p>jan 21 was arrested in mayavaram. the funny thing is there ws so much <br />demand for thani nabar sathyagraham for which the mahatma himself had <br />to give permission. kalki chose a place - sina kadai veethi in <br />mayavaram. but then the place and date had alredy been allotted to <br />another person. that man "sacrificed" his location for kalki.<br />kalki spent 3 months in jail coming out in april<br />in august he had started the kalki magazine in egmore office with <br />secondhand reconditioned machinery.<br />by december the kalki magazine hadbecome a household name.</p>

<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Vijay Kumar<br />.S" <vj_episteme@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hi guys,</p>
<p>  Let keep the discussions as far as possible closer to PS. I had the <br />  good fortune of attending a talk organised by the singapore library <br />  last evening - the topic was </p>
<p>  The Imperial Cholas: An 11th Century Example of Regional Power Play <br />  in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>  the paper was presented by a Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow, Mr <br />  Prasanna Weerawardane. ( will circulate once i get a copy).</p>
<p>  While the paper was interesting, there were a few grey areas, <br />thanks <br />  to the little knowledge i gained by being a part of this group and <br />  reading the archives i took this up and it was well appareciated. <br />  listing below:</p>
<p>  The paper projected the cholas as a warring clan - eager to invade, <br />  raid countries for furthering their interests:</p>
<p>  - examples were cited from the chornicle ( culavamsa) - of RRc <br />  taking back untold treasures, pillage the anuradhapura vihara etc.<br />  - unlike other campaigns - the cholas wanted to annexe lanka for <br />its <br />  resources.<br />  - the cholas ill treated the royal women and took away king mahinda <br />  IV and his wife to madura where he died.</p>
<p>  - the first attack on srivijaya by rjc was because they went on a <br />  specific disinformation on the chola power - leading to the first <br />  envoy from chola land being treated as an insignificant kingdom by <br />  the sung dynasty.<br />  - the profits from these raids were used to shower gifts on the big <br />  temple<br />  - the second raid on srivijaya by kullottunga was caused by the <br />  srilankan king seeking his aid to fight the cholas - the help was <br />by <br />  providing products from the peninsula to aid the srilankan army/pay <br />  for their expenses. the attack was against this aid.<br />  - the buddhist viharam in nagapatinam was set up bascially to <br />attact <br />  trade.</p>
<p>  while it was heartening to note the amount of interest the cholas <br />  still hold among the intellectual faternity here, my arguments were <br />  as below:</p>
<p>  1. The lankan angle has been going on since pallava period and the <br />  incursions were not unilateral. the lankan crown did interfere in <br />  the affairs of the chola state due to their close relations with <br />the <br />  pandya crown.</p>
<p>  2. the pillage might have been in search of the pandya diadems - <br />  which the chola wanted back to ensure peace reigned in his state. <br />so <br />  the cholas were acting in self defense to ensure stability by <br />  closing out the pandya for good.</p>
<p>  3. mahinda IV and his queen were taken back to madurai to stay in a <br />  palace and he lived a further 12 years there before eventually <br />  dying. what was the reason for this? the chola/pandya style of <br />  disposing an enemy is evident from their titles - chop the head off <br />-<br />  yet they let the lankan king live for 12 years </p>
<p>  4. right from pallava period buddha is shown as a sub incar of <br />  krishna and worshipped. even though south indian kings were <br />  frequently at war, they never touched the temples. so there was a <br />  sanctity associated with temples. the viharam was supported through <br />  generous grants by RRC,and these grants were further re instated by <br />  kulottunga. hence it could be a one sided account of the mahavamsa <br />  to say that the viharams of lanka were destroyed. </p>
<p>  5. complete annhiliation of sri vijaya doesnt quite justify the <br />  chola style of functioning. just the system of misinforming the <br />usng <br />  dynasty by the sri vijaya could not have been a reason for such a <br />  massive strike. at the same time the cambodian king was paying <br />  tributes - he gifted his famous chariot to the chola king.</p>

        <p>-Hi<br />kalki and sadasivam met in jail. two terms they spent together.</p>
<p>kalki became editor of anandavikadan and onhi s recommendation <br />sadasivam joined as advertisementmanager. that too he left soon.<br />he was runing around promoting his wife M.S in the movie world.<br />it was then that kalki had his historic fight with vasan owner of  <br />ananda vikadan and walked out on jan first 1941.<br />then things started so fast that people started gossiping that the <br />two had been planing a magazine for long itselt. additional evidence <br />that kalki had finished parthiban kanavu during his ananda vikadan <br />days itself but did not give for printing addded credence.<br />however kalki went to jail till april and M.s took up a role as <br />narathar and gave 20 000 rupees as capital for kalki. a friend from <br />trichy gave 5000. 25 shares were registered and 15 to ms , 5 to the <br />trichy friend and 5 to kalki.<br />second handmachinery were given by the kalaimagal group.</p>
<p>in fact in their second office at chetpet sadasivam stayed above the <br />presses. a noisy atmosphere for the nightingale MS.</p>
<p>after kalki's death sadasivam wanted to stop the magazine but rajaji <br />prevailed on him.<br />later sadasivam would marry off his second daughter to kalki's son <br />rajendran.<br />i also think(?) that all shares in name of MS were given to kalki <br />family .</p>

<p>        Hi guys,</p>
<p>        Let keep the discussions as far as possible closer to PS. I <br />had<br />    the<br />        good fortune of attending a talk organised by the singapore<br />    library<br />        last evening - the topic was</p>
<p>        The Imperial Cholas: An 11th Century Example of Regional <br />Power<br />    Play<br />        in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>        the paper was presented by a Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow, <br />Mr<br />        Prasanna Weerawardane. ( will circulate once i get a copy).</p>
<p>        While the paper was interesting, there were a few grey areas,<br />      thanks<br />        to the little knowledge i gained by being a part of this <br />group<br />    and<br />        reading the archives i took this up and it was well<br />    appareciated.<br />        listing below:</p>
<p>        The paper projected the cholas as a warring clan - eager to<br />    invade,<br />        raid countries for furthering their interests:</p>
<p>        - examples were cited from the chornicle ( culavamsa) - of <br />RRc<br />        taking back untold treasures, pillage the anuradhapura vihara<br />    etc.<br />        - unlike other campaigns - the cholas wanted to annexe lanka <br />for<br />      its<br />        resources.<br />        - the cholas ill treated the royal women and took away king<br />    mahinda<br />        IV and his wife to madura where he died.</p>
<p>        - the first attack on srivijaya by rjc was because they went <br />on<br />    a<br />        specific disinformation on the chola power - leading to the<br />    first<br />        envoy from chola land being treated as an insignificant <br />kingdom<br />    by<br />        the sung dynasty.<br />        - the profits from these raids were used to shower gifts on <br />the<br />    big<br />        temple<br />        - the second raid on srivijaya by kullottunga was caused by <br />the<br />        srilankan king seeking his aid to fight the cholas - the help<br />    was<br />      by<br />        providing products from the peninsula to aid the srilankan<br />    army/pay<br />        for their expenses. the attack was against this aid.<br />        - the buddhist viharam in nagapatinam was set up bascially to<br />      attact<br />        trade.</p>
<p>        while it was heartening to note the amount of interest the<br />    cholas<br />        still hold among the intellectual faternity here, my <br />arguments<br />    were<br />        as below:</p>
<p>        1. The lankan angle has been going on since pallava period <br />and<br />    the<br />        incursions were not unilateral. the lankan crown did <br />interfere<br />    in<br />        the affairs of the chola state due to their close relations <br />with<br />      the<br />        pandya crown.</p>
<p>        2. the pillage might have been in search of the pandya <br />diadems -<br />        which the chola wanted back to ensure peace reigned in his<br />    state.<br />      so<br />        the cholas were acting in self defense to ensure stability by<br />        closing out the pandya for good.</p>
<p>        3. mahinda IV and his queen were taken back to madurai to <br />stay<br />    in a<br />        palace and he lived a further 12 years there before <br />eventually<br />        dying. what was the reason for this? the chola/pandya style <br />of<br />        disposing an enemy is evident from their titles - chop the <br />head<br />    off<br />      -<br />        yet they let the lankan king live for 12 years</p>
<p>        4. right from pallava period buddha is shown as a sub incar <br />of<br />        krishna and worshipped. even though south indian kings were<br />        frequently at war, they never touched the temples. so there <br />was<br />    a<br />        sanctity associated with temples. the viharam was supported<br />    through<br />        generous grants by RRC,and these grants were further re <br />instated<br />    by<br />        kulottunga. hence it could be a one sided account of the<br />    mahavamsa<br />        to say that the viharams of lanka were destroyed.</p>
<p>        5. complete annhiliation of sri vijaya doesnt quite justify <br />the<br />        chola style of functioning. just the system of misinforming <br />the<br />      usng<br />        dynasty by the sri vijaya could not have been a reason for <br />such<br />    a<br />        massive strike. at the same time the cambodian king was <br />paying<br />        tributes - he gifted his famous chariot to the chola king.</p>

<p>    - examples were cited from the chornicle ( culavamsa) - of RRc <br />    taking back untold treasures, pillage the anuradhapura vihara <br />etc.<br />    - unlike other campaigns - the cholas wanted to annexe lanka for <br />  its <br />    resources.<br />    - the cholas ill treated the royal women and took away king <br />mahinda <br />    IV and his wife to madura where he died.</p>
<p>    - the first attack on srivijaya by rjc was because they went on <br />a <br />    specific disinformation on the chola power - leading to the <br />first <br />    envoy from chola land being treated as an insignificant kingdom <br />by <br />    the sung dynasty.<br />    - the profits from these raids were used to shower gifts on the <br />big <br />    temple<br />    - the second raid on srivijaya by kullottunga was caused by the <br />    srilankan king seeking his aid to fight the cholas - the help <br />was <br />  by <br />    providing products from the peninsula to aid the srilankan <br />army/pay <br />    for their expenses. the attack was against this aid.<br />    - the buddhist viharam in nagapatinam was set up bascially to <br />  attact <br />    trade.</p>
<p>    while it was heartening to note the amount of interest the <br />cholas <br />    still hold among the intellectual faternity here, my arguments <br />were <br />    as below:</p>
<p>    1. The lankan angle has been going on since pallava period and <br />the <br />    incursions were not unilateral. the lankan crown did interfere <br />in <br />    the affairs of the chola state due to their close relations with <br />  the <br />    pandya crown.</p>
<p>    2. the pillage might have been in search of the pandya diadems - <br />    which the chola wanted back to ensure peace reigned in his <br />state. <br />  so <br />    the cholas were acting in self defense to ensure stability by <br />    closing out the pandya for good.</p>
<p>    3. mahinda IV and his queen were taken back to madurai to stay <br />in a <br />    palace and he lived a further 12 years there before eventually <br />    dying. what was the reason for this? the chola/pandya style of <br />    disposing an enemy is evident from their titles - chop the head <br />off <br />  -<br />    yet they let the lankan king live for 12 years </p>
<p>    4. right from pallava period buddha is shown as a sub incar of <br />    krishna and worshipped. even though south indian kings were <br />    frequently at war, they never touched the temples. so there was <br />a <br />    sanctity associated with temples. the viharam was supported <br />through <br />    generous grants by RRC,and these grants were further re instated <br />by <br />    kulottunga. hence it could be a one sided account of the <br />mahavamsa <br />    to say that the viharams of lanka were destroyed. </p>
<p>    5. complete annhiliation of sri vijaya doesnt quite justify the <br />    chola style of functioning. just the system of misinforming the <br />  usng <br />    dynasty by the sri vijaya could not have been a reason for such <br />a <br />    massive strike. at the same time the cambodian king was paying <br />    tributes - he gifted his famous chariot to the chola king.</p></vj_episteme@></p></blockquote>
