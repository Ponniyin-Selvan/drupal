<p>Inscriptions from the time of Aditya Chola I (870-907), Raja Raja I <br />(10th - 11th cent) &amp; his descendants speaking of endowments made by <br />the Chola rulers to this temple are found here. Vikrama Cholan <br />built the Vikramacholan Tirumandapam (1118-1135). </p>
<p>The present structure of the temple as well as the beautiful bronze <br />images in this temple are a contribution of the Great Chola emperor <br />Raja Raja Chola I. Some of these bronzes were recovered in treasure <br />troves unearthed here. The Ardhanareeswarar and Chandeswarar <br />bronzes are now housed in the Chennai Museum. Natarajar, <br />Somaskandar, Devi, Bhoga Sakthi are housed in the temple, while <br />images of Subramanyar, Rishabhavahanadevar, Bhikshatanar, <br />Kalyanasundarar Kannappar and others are housed in the Thanjavur Art <br />Gallery.</p>

<p>    One can confidently say that Skanda puranam is much earlier to <br />  ramayana's time, I would say close to Macha avatar. Looking at <br />  instances in thirupugazh where Arunagiri cites Hanuman reading <br />  between lines of his command to search for Mother in the southern <br />  direction, in the process, gets blessed by Muruga at Kathir kamam <br />  (which opens another link of where is the Lanka portrayed in the <br />  epic, according to the vision of Arunagiri , Hanuman seeks Skanda's <br />  blessing after burning lanka and returning to India - so <br />  geographically the locations point to lemuria.....again). <br />    Ref: Song about Kathirkamam in thirupugazh - udukka thugil <br />vendum, <br />  again a melter for those aanmigam sinthanaiyalars and tamil <br />literacy <br />  lovers.</p>

<p>    Nithya Kalyana Perumal Temple : </p>
<p>    This holy shrine is one among the 100 temples called Tirupathy. <br />  The <br />    goddess Lakshmi is also called as `Thiru'. The presiding diety <br />is <br />    holding her on the left side. So it is called Thiru-Idathu-<br />  Eanthai <br />    which over a period of time came to be called as Thiru-<br />vidanthai. <br />    Tamil Saint Thiru Mangai Alwar has sung the glory of this holy <br />  place <br />    in ten places in his famous `Pasuram'. There are several <br />messages <br />    relating to this is available in the stone scripture of first <br />  Raja <br />    Raja Cholan and Vijaya Rajendra Cholan</p>

<p>Our beloved Venkat's In-Laws family is major Donors and Trustees of <br />Thiruvengadu temple .. and my family used to identify Venkat's wife <br />as THIRUVENGATTU NANGAI (w/o Paranchoti @ Siruthondar !)!</p>
<p>VENN :: WHITE Color: SWETHA varnam :::: Vennkadu :: Swetharanyam</p>
<p>It is where Kali - Nataraja dance duel took place, in which Siva <br />lifted his leg and put back a kundalam in his ear, which Kali found <br />unpalatable to perform .. (that Kali sitting in the outskirts of <br />Chimdambaram in penance as Ellaikkali is additional datum).</p>
<p>It is where Siva in the form of Bikshadanar moved around...</p>
<p>Swetha Kethu getting Longivity as per Vishnupuranam took place in <br />this area only in Annankoil at Swetha Pushkarani. Thiruvali's King <br />Thirumangai (Azhwar)'s wife Kumudhavalli was born here .. near 11 <br />Divyadesams of Thirunangur.. !</p>
<p>Sambandar was born in neary Brahmapuram @ Seerkazhi and hymned " <br />Thodudya seviyan .. Brahmapuramevia ".. Thevaram. As a kid, when he <br />visited Thiruvengadu on the shoulders of his father, every SAND <br />particle looked like Sivalingam to him.. hymned " Manalellam <br />Sivalingam .. " and refused to get down fearing that his feet may <br />touch a Sivalingam. So Sakthi flew over and CLUTCHED SAMBANDAR and <br />carried him to the Temple .. The icon PILLAIYIDUKKI is there at the <br />back of the sanctum of Sakthi!</p>
<p>Supposed to be 1lakh Yr old Brahma in Thapas in this temple ..</p>
<p>Sembian Madevi changed this from Brick to Katrali.. About 80 years <br />back when the renovation was undetaken, along with several bronzes - <br />UNMATCHING KSHETHRA BALAR - BIKSHADANAR were found.. When noticing <br />from the Rear, one can find that the Siva's Jadamudi's are NONE <br />OTHER THAN SNAKES !</p>
<p>Bronze of Our KRISHNAN RAMAN - who raised the Thanjai Big Temple <br />Thiruchutru - was also found !  </p>
<p>These are now kept in Thanjai Palace Museum. </p>
<p>The Nataraja and the Chitsabai are KNOWN AS AADHI CHIDAMBARAM.  <br />There is every possibility that this was worshipped by the <br />kaveripoonpattinam - Puhar - Chozhas (Karikal valavan included) till <br />the Tsunami engulfed Poompuhar and later on they moved inlands to <br />preseent-day CHIDAMBARAM .. </p>
<p>The entire area is known as SWETHARANYAM !</p>

<p>Burnt the lust, which could burn all the discipline, with the <br />beautiful eye between the brows - that Lord's graceful abode is <br />thiruchcheN^kAttaN^kudi . In that town came the man of unimaginable <br />great deeds paranychOdhiyAr . He learnt AyurvEdam, saMskR^itam and <br />the usage of arms in a flawless way. With a matured knowledge he <br />came to the conclusion that crown all the arts is crawling snake <br />ornated God's feet and nurtured steadily the growing love for that <br />comforting feet. Serving the devotees of the Deedless, he undertook <br />the position of the head of the king's army. He won the battle of <br />vAdhApi exhibiting his splendid valiance, brilliance and knowledge. <br />When the king was wondering about his magnificent performance the <br />ministers told him as paranychOdhiyAr was the servant of the Three-<br />eyed Lord there was nobody to defeat him. Hearing that he was a <br />devotee the judicious king was afraid that he had sent a devotee to <br />the killing battlefield. He gave him a lots of gifts and properties <br />and requested him to serve the Lord dedicating his time for that. <br />paranychOdhiyAr returned to his town and spent the all time in <br />serving the sha.nkara at the gaNapathIchcharam temple of the town. <br />He got married to the girl veNkAttu n^aN^gai who stood for the <br />principles of the devotee. </p>
<p>For the devotees of the God ornated by feather, flowers and flowing <br />river, the devotee of thriuchcheN^kAttaN^kudi everyday used to host <br />feast and then only eat. This he followed as a ritual without <br />failure and his hospitality was known in all the directions. He <br />being so humble in the presence of the limitlessly famed devotees he <br />was known as chiRuth thoNdar (small servant). While his service was <br />continuing blissfully praying the unmeasurable feet of the Lord the <br />couple got a child. They named him chIrALa dhEvar . To celebrate the <br />birth of the child who arrived like the fruit of the austerities the <br />devotee made it a grand festival for the entire town. He donated <br />liberally to the devotees and made all the rituals with the sound of <br />vEdas reverberating the sky. The kid was brought up with utmost care <br />of the parents. When he was three years old they sent him to the <br />school to learn the worth learning arts. That time the Sun that rose <br />to drive away the illusions and enlighten the world in shaivam - the <br />prodigy thirunyAnachampan^dhar (1) came there. Holding his soft feet <br />on his head and heart the devotee saluted him. The saint stayed in <br />his place for some days and he praised the honest and whole-hearted <br />service of chiRuththoNdar in the hymn he sang there. </p>
<p>The Lord who is independent of external enjoyment wanted to <br />demonstrate that the great are capable of doing deeds which are <br />terrific even to think of for others. In place of lightning like <br />matted hair He took dark cloud like matted hair, in place of the <br />young growing crescent - a crescent shaped stripes of Holy ash, in <br />place of snake ear-ring - a floral ring, in place of the ornament of <br />skulls - a shining string of white stones, in place of the fierce <br />elephant skin cladding - cladded in clothe, obscuring the black <br />throat, with unlimited grace in the eyes, smile in the lips, beauty <br />throughout the body, holding up the spear, the kazal worn in the <br />legs inviting everybody to salute that form of Mercy, the Supreme <br />came in the form of a bhairAgi. The God who feeds the entire world, <br />acting as if He was terribly hungry came to the devotees house <br />enquiring where it is. Only his wife was there in the house. The <br />Lord in the form of bhairAgi asked was there the servant of Lord in <br />the house who everyday gives food for the devotees. Realizing a sage <br />had come the chaste thiruveNkAttun^aN^gaiyAr came out and said <br />saluting him that her husband had gone out and invited Him to come <br />inside the house. The bhairAgi replied He would not come inside the <br />house where a woman is alone. Immediately the humble lady went to <br />the other extreme of the house and told Him that as her husband did <br />not find any devotee that day to host he had gone searching for one <br />and would be really happy if he knew that a devotee had come on his <br />own. She asked Him to sit inside the house. The Lord appreciated her <br />that they followed in the right way the discipline of family life, <br />but still He would not enter the house without the devotee present <br />and would be waiting for him under a tree near the temple. </p>
<p>To the sincere servant who came back sad unable to find any devotee, <br />his matched wife told that a devotee from the north in the form of <br />bhairAgi came there and was waiting near the temple tree for him. <br />With growing eagerness he went to the bhairAgi and saluted to be <br />asked by Him "Are you the great small servant ?". The great even <br />though they consider themselves small would be acknowledged as great <br />only by the Truth ! The humble servant replied that he was not <br />praisable in the group of devotees but out of mercy the devotees <br />call him so. He told it was the effect of all the good deeds he <br />would have done, for Him to come to his house. The sage who claimed <br />to come from the north said the food He wanted was very difficult to <br />prepare. He wanted a life to be cooked that too a human in the age <br />not exceeding five, having no physical impairments, should be the <br />only child for the family and the child s parents should cook it <br />happily ! The devotee with uncomparable dedication said there is <br />nothing in the world that is impossible to achieve for the devotees. <br />Saluting Him he came back home. </p>
<p>The devotee told his wife the type of food the sage asked for. They <br />decided to cook their loving young son for the devotee to have food. <br />Father went and brought the child from the school. He bathed him, <br />cleaned his body completely. With the mother holding the child s <br />hands and legs, the child enjoying their great deed, father cut his <br />head and did the unimaginable deed. The couple of synchronized <br />thoughts were not sad but were happy about serving the devotee. <br />Removing the head considering it would not be good for feast the <br />loving mother cooked the rest with other food materials. Then the <br />superior servant invited the sage to accept the feast, begging <br />pardon for any delay he would have made in preparing the feast. <br />Washing the Feet that kicked the death to death, they sprinkled that <br />holy water on themselves and throughout the house. His principled <br />wife served the rice, meat and all the food materials in a plate <br />over a white cloth. The sage asked them whether they cooked all the <br />parts of the child. They replied in affirmative but said that as the <br />head would not be good for the feast they did not cook it. The <br />playful Lord said He liked that too. The worry of that wonderable <br />couple vanished when a helper chan^dhanaththAr came forward and said <br />that she cooked the head too thinking that it would be useful when <br />the devotee eats, and gave that part too. </p>
<p>Now the Lord ordered him to bring a devotee to eat with Him. chiRuth <br />thoNdar perumAn searched but came back unable to find one. To the <br />worrying devotee He said he himself was a good devotee and asked him <br />to eat. When chiRuth thoNdar was about to eat from the food that his <br />wife served similarly for him in order to make the sage accept the <br />feast, the bhairAgi stopped him asking what was his hurry while He <br />Himself who eat once in six months had not started. He asked him to <br />call his son. Shocked the devotee replied his son would not be <br />helpful then. But the sage refused to eat without his son being <br />present. Highly anxious the patient devotee went outside and called <br />out his son loudly. His caring wife also shouted calling the child s <br />name, "Oh! my dear child, chIrALA ! come fast to make the devotee <br />have his feast !!". Who knows the grace of God !! Their son came <br />running as if he was returning from the school. The couple embraced <br />him and kissed him thinking they could now be blessed by the devotee <br />accepting their feast ! When they came inside the house they were <br />shocked at the absence of the bhairAgi as well as the meat that was <br />cooked. Removing all their worries, removing their bonds, removing <br />their source of birth, the Remover of pains the Lord who disappeared <br />appeared as the form of grace with the Daughter of Himalayas and the <br />young beautiful son murugan on the Holy Bull. Blessing the devotee, <br />his beloved wife and loving son the Lord, His inseparable shakti and <br />the Son who destroyed the sUra took them giving place in their feet <br />that is ultimate the price for great deeds. Let the marveylous <br />dedication of chiRuththoNdar stay in the mind. </p>

        <p>Thiruvenkaadu also close to my heart. Recently I had been there.</p>
<p>I think Venkatesh family constructed Bhuthan Temple nearby AmbaL temple- or some other structure (?).. It is also Bhuthan's kshetram</p>
<p>One Archakar told me that there are only very few Archaka families left in the town now and future looks bleak. </p>
<p>Due to the stature of Navagraha kshetram, number of pilgrims are visiting the Temple. It is a very good sign. </p>
<p>Saiva Samaya first Acharya Meykandar's father was asked to take bath in the tank before birth of the great Acharya. It is said the bath at Tirevenkaadu Tank is suggested for those who do not have kids.</p>

        <p>This story reminds me of saying by Ramanujacharya who went up the Tirupathi hill on his knees saying that the whole hill is the Lord himself.<br />It would be curious to know of the history of the sthalam vs gyanasambandar's entry there. That will give clues of the real time line on ramayana.</p>
<p>One can confidently say that Skanda puranam is much earlier to ramayana's time, I would say close to Macha avatar. Looking at instances in thirupugazh where Arunagiri cites Hanuman reading between lines of his command to search for Mother in the southern direction, in the process, gets blessed by Muruga at Kathir kamam (which opens another link of where is the Lanka portrayed in the epic, according to the vision of Arunagiri , Hanuman seeks Skanda's blessing after burning lanka and returning to India - so geographically the locations point to lemuria.....again). <br />Ref: Song about Kathirkamam in thirupugazh - udukka thugil vendum, again a melter for those aanmigam sinthanaiyalars and tamil literacy lovers.</p>
