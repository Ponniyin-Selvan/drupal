<p>    While on the topic, Did kannappar put his leg on the lingam while<br />    gouging his other eye. Or did shiva stop him when he was in the act of<br />    doing it in his first eye? Rememeber reading an interesting article in<br />    earlier issues of varalaru.com regarding a sculpture panel fm<br />    sriperumbudur temple. Will try and post it again.

<p>      I was merely responding to one of the comments made by Srinivasan<br />    Natarajan<br />      on the subject- "The term true devotion itself is relative. I can never<br />    dare<br />      to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt."</p>
<p>      The points I was trying to make are-</p>
<p>      a. Kannappar (and the alike) demonstrated unconditional, single minded<br />      and steadfast devotion that surpassed physical sufferings. The relation<br />    was<br />      one to one with the Lord who tested his devout commitment to the cause.<br />      It is also true in each one of the stories of Nayanars ( thanks for<br />    your<br />      some references to the 63 you have made ).</p>
<p>      Once tested, and proved of his sterling devotion, Kannappa was stopped<br />    from<br />      culling out his second eye-</p>
<p>      " thangan mun ida-k-kung kaiai-th-thadu-k-ka moondradu-k-ku<br />      naaga<br />      kanganar amudavar-k-kuk ' Kannappa nirka' endra... "</p>
<p>      Leading to my second point -</p>
<p>      b. Physical suffering is not the only measure of true devotion.</p>
<p>      c. 'thee midi' rituals can't be compared to devotions exemplified by<br />      the likes of Kannappa.</p>
<p>      Ms. Malathi, thanks for your clarification; it is indeed difficult<br />      to make a distinction of group fervor influenced by social<br />    compulsions from<br />      true devotion.</p>
<p>      In my humble opinion neither physical sufferings demonstrate<br />    devotion, nor<br />      scriptures prescribe them as atonement.</p>
<p>      Your reference to cleaning murky mind is life long sojourn, to realize<br />    that<br />      mind needs cleaning being the first mile stone.</p>
<p>      Sri. Vairam's story is touching demonstration of faith and conviction.<br />      Such experience with divinity could be best cherished by the individuals<br />    who<br />      undergo the encounters.</p>
<p>      Best regards,</p>
<p>      TMS</p>

<p>      Hi Malathi</p>
<p>      If you notice I did not say ` great', only feats. They were judged and<br />      inducted into the hall of fame ( by who - venkat has asked this question<br />      many time). To understand why and what were the criteria etc, needs a<br />      measure, judgement and understanding that a contemporary yardstick will<br />    not<br />      do justice.</p>
<p>      I was only wanting to highlight the rest of the elite group as a reply to<br />      below statement by our good member and that there are many more such<br />    feats<br />      in tiruthondarthogai.</p>
<p>      " here was only one Kannappa nayanar we know of symbolizing uncondit<br />    ional<br />      adoration to the Lord he believed and nursed by culling his one eye."</p>

<p>      I think on terms with Sri TMS that some of these are social compulsions<br />    and<br />      some are pure fervour that is hard to categorize. I think things like<br />      'pillai kari' are not things one should eulogize in these times and age.<br />    It<br />      is also somewhat indicative of our own double standards isn't it not ..we<br />      think Jayadeva's example of a woman risking adultery to prove her love to<br />      the lord is obscene but we think a man cooking his child to prove is<br />      devotion is a great feat???</p>

<p>        Hi</p>
<p>        There is only one kannappar !!! Hmm, that's the pity, the 63 adorn the<br />        quiet sides of our temples and we are not aware of their feats.<br />        Oferring own hair as a wick, grinding ones elbow for sandal wood,<br />        letting even an assasin go, wanting to give up his life when the king<br />        finds his war killed one saint !!, pillai kari ( oferring own child's<br />        meat), tonsuring his daughter on the eve of her marriage ....how many<br />        you want</p>

Several bloody sacrificial practices were<br />          common<br />          during Hindu religious rituals ( tantric sacrificial rituals) in the<br />          period<br />          of social and religious rudderless-ness and vacuum when Buddism and<br />          Jainism<br />          reached their nadir points. The religious practices were given<br />          direction<br />          and attained restoration thorugh the preachings of reformers suchas<br />          Adi<br />          Shankara in the 8 th century . Several obnoxious practices such as<br />    Sati<br />          (<br />          co-cremation of widows along with diseased husbands ) continued<br />          socially<br />          well into 19th Century until it was legally banned by the Britishin<br />          Bengal<br />          around 1829. We know of a few occurrences even during our present<br />          times.</tmsunder@></p>
<p>          Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social<br />    compulsions<br />          and<br />          or for acceptance without semblance of adherence to devotion, even<br />          though<br />          they are colored of religious connotation. Participants of 'Thee<br />          midhi' or shiates' who engage in self beating bloody on the tenthday<br />          of 'moharram' have more fervor and less of everything else. The<br />          performers<br />          no doubt end up in risking bodily injuries.</p>
<p>          There was only one Kannappa nayanar we know of<br />          symbolizing uncondit ional adoration to the Lord he believed and<br />    nursed<br />          by<br />          culling his one eye. We also know that the Lord came to stop him from<br />          doing<br />          further self infliction.</p>
<p>          'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>          The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a<br />          strategy<br />          for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite<br />    safety<br />          measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places<br />          you<br />          can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your<br />          feet is<br />          what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has<br />          nothing<br />          to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few<br />    laughs<br />          :))</p>

<p>                   Calling Theemidhi as a stunt in Devotion seems to be like an<br />                 acute criticism. The term true devotion itself is relative. I<br />                 can<br />                 never dare<br />                 to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt.</p>

<p>                       Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of<br />                       unflinching faith<br />                 and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to<br />    lot<br />                 of<br />                 accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that<br />    the<br />                 appeal does<br />                 not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds<br />    on<br />                 person's<br />                 feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK<br />                 protests<br />                 may be<br />                 anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such<br />    as<br />                 these.</p>
<p>                       There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith<br />    is<br />                       not<br />                 possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                         The thee midhi is an ancient living tradition - a<br />                         hallmark<br />                         of<br />                 unclinching faith of the masses. These festivals, usually<br />    mocked<br />                 by<br />                 the<br />                 Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti<br />                 worship in<br />                 Tamil<br />                 nadu..</p>
<p>                         But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some<br />                         "unique"<br />                         practice<br />                 separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream<br />    Hinduism<br />                 is<br />                 highly<br />                 flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial<br />                 style<br />                 of<br />                 viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragmentand<br />                 not<br />                 as whole<br />                 and holistic..</p>
<p>                         In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual<br />    is<br />                         indicative<br />                 of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is<br />    worshipped<br />                 durign this<br />                 festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi<br />                 amman,<br />                 Kali<br />                 amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani<br />    amman,<br />                 Draupadi<br />                 amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that *unites*<br />                 all<br />                 these<br />                 ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has a deep<br />                 philosophy<br />                 and<br />                 great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called<br />                 Durga<br />                 Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worship whichis<br />                 part<br />                 of<br />                 Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will<br />    take<br />                 literally<br />                 thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless<br />    her<br />                 devotees in<br />                 each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised.<br />                 Mariamman is<br />                 mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as<br />                 Vaishnavi<br />                 Devi in<br />                 these verses!</p>
<p>                         ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that<br />                         is<br />                         Shiva's<br />                 emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and<br />    in<br />                 most of<br />                 the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the<br />                 firewalkers<br />                 shout<br />                 "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does<br />    the<br />                 poster say<br />                 that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism,<br />                 Shaktism<br />                 and<br />                 Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                         Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that<br />                         trasncends the<br />                 ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is<br />                 so<br />                 blatantly<br />                 visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that<br />                 calls<br />                 for<br />                 great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                         friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice<br />                         event<br />                         on the<br />                 forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                         last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire<br />                         walking) in<br />                 chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the<br />                 street<br />                 corner<br />                 temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman<br />                 temples in<br />                 chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                         no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to<br />    the<br />                         people<br />                 than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman<br />                 followers.<br />                 only the<br />                 remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                         the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal<br />                         kudam<br />                         oorvalam,<br />                 karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are<br />                 halmark of<br />                 these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devoteesare<br />                 mostly from<br />                 the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness<br />                 among<br />                 these<br />                 people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                         a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation<br />                         of<br />                         the<br />                 masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of<br />    psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                         mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing<br />    tradition<br />                         which has<br />                 not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or<br />                 christian waves<br />                 in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal<br />    religious<br />                 movements<br />                 have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil<br />                 community.</p>
<p>                         hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and<br />                         large<br />                         in<br />                 tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping<br />                 ofcourse.<br />                         i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem<br />    rural<br />                         district<br />                 pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of<br />                 kalvarayn<br />                 hills.</p>
<p>                         in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after<br />                         2500<br />                         years<br />                 of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

        <p>Ravi, yes the argument is oxymoronic in a way. And in some ways it goes back to - what do we want to beleive as 'real'? Lot of people have issues even believing RRJ and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  did not exist like Kalki or some historical writer imagined them to be, they did not speak 'pure tamil' and have the same eat/drink/civilian habits. By 'real' we mean something that has origins in history or happened the way I think it did?</p>
<p>Origins is history..is perhaps the closest we can come to. Happened the way I think it did..probably not. BTW Kunti and Mary are not quite the same...Kunti begets a child as a result of an actual relationship with Surya, not via 'spirit' as Mary does. The guilt around human man woman relationships that was introduced by the church particularly the catholic church has a lot to do with this idea of spirit child. There are lot of Christian mystics who believe the Adam and Eve story is also not the way it is commonly said that is subject for another discussion.</p>
<p>In all these things we have to first ask ourselves - what do I want to believe. If i do not have any agenda in my beleif then the 'whys' make more sense to examine than the how or what.</p>

<p>      Â  <br />      Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just fyi I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>      Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysically the soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor for spiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi' , Draupadi was attracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>        My English Professor, defined king as a small emperor and emperor as a<br />        big king.</p>
<p>        History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />        history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />        in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />        several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />        of Gandhi etc.)</p>
<p>        It is preferable not to get swayed or bulldozed by the 'scientific' tag<br />        attached to extrapolated and biased versions of 'history'.</p>

<p>          Hello Vairam</p>
<p>          Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />        the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />        etc).</p>
<p>          Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />          If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />        on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />        Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>          If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />        references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />        control problem irukke?</p>
<p>          Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />        according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />        case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>          Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />        patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />        proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record<br />        to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />        current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />        bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>          Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />        research anyway.</p>
<p>          Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />        survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />        story come by?</p>
<p>          I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />        all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />        sense.</p>
<p>          As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search of<br />        Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />        he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />        short cut :-).</p>
<p>          Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />        now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />        Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />          Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />        Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />        say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />        scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>            you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />            My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />        said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />            It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>            Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />        history.</p>
<p>            But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />        know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>            I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />        had year ago!</p>
<p>            I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />        believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />            Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />        what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />            Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />        against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />        other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />        finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />        welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>            Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />        labyrinth again.</p>

<p>              Dear Vairam</p>
<p>              Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />        and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />        have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>              However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />        anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />        line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />        similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>              I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />        Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />              Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />        Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />        study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>                 He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />        the literature itself.</p>
<p>              For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />        and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />        foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />        not be so.</p>
<p>              Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />        entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />        Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />        Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>              As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />        adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>              I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />        noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />        Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />        poet.</p>
<p>              Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />        itself makes a mile of difference Ð¦ the usage of that term, on how a<br />        person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />        literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />        written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>              I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />        location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />        thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />        spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />        there, it is also difficult to prove Ð•it was not there.<br />              Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />        as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />        with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />        southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />        Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />        believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />        question posed before too.</p>
<p>              I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />        avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ð¦<br />        his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />        there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>              When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />        it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />        the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />        possible.</p>
<p>              Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />        this research?</p>
<p>              Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />        enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />        experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />        entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>                 Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />        are.</p>
<p>              Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />        to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ð¦ purely due to his<br />        dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />        tread.</p>
<p>              However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />        relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>              Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />        literature Ð¦ just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />        bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />        these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />        awe.</p>
<p>              However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />        even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />              These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />        though many do not agree.</p>
<p>              PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some<br />        argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;</p>

<p>                Hi Ravi,<br />                Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />        in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />        various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />        He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>                  Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />        research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />                I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />        of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />        Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />        members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />        left in these pages.</p>
<p>                  I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />        cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />                  It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />        base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />                Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />        been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />        Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />        knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />        work - The Eight Anthologies) .<br />                He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />        claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />        his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />        to an off spring of Sanskrit by scholars like KAN Shastri). From 1952 to<br />        nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />        Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />        out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />        biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />        <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>                So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />        you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />        your views on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>                  History does not account for various stories and tales of the<br />        bard, which seems to be having many lines of history before being sung.</p>
<p>                  Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />        research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />                  I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />        cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />                  It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />        base line that starts with a western ideology.</p>

<p>                    Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's<br />        Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating<br />        of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for<br />        dating of various literature.</p>

        <p>So what in real is the myth here ? I can believe that draupadi had 5 husbands and 5 children and kunti had unconventional children and same as virgin mary concept (which some hardline western thoughts find it difficult to believe).<br />Malathi infact, explained the 'why' in the metaphysical sense, we are talking the lines of how and what in our historical prespectives.My tread is there is no how or what without the why!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Draupadi's fraternal polyandry is metaphysically expalined by Malathi. But it is true Draupadi had real husbands, children and above all a real mother-in- law Kunti ! Pandavas, Hastinapur and Kurukshetra were very much part of history. </p>
<p>  Both virigin Mary and Kunti became mothers unconventionally; Is calling virgin Mary a myth justified?</p>

<p>    <br />  If virgin mary is a myth and draupadi's communion is metaphysical</p>
<p>  The history vs myth questions that sound solid in my ears are</p>
<p>  Who would be Karnan, Pandavas?</p>
<p>  Which really complicates the next question.</p>
<p>  How did the pandavas(who already seem a myth) have kids Prativindhya, Sutasoma, Srutakarman, Satanika, and Srutasena through a metaphysical communion?</p>

<p>    Â  <br />    Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just fyi I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>    Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysically the soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor for spiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi' , Draupadi was attracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>      I fully agree with you, Ravi.</p>
<p>      My English Professor, defined king as a small emperor and emperor as a<br />      big king.</p>
<p>      History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />      history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />      in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />      several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />      of Gandhi etc.)</p>
<p>      It is preferable not to get swayed or bulldozed by the 'scientific' tag<br />      attached to extrapolated and biased versions of 'history'.</p>

<p>        Hello Vairam</p>
<p>        Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />      the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />      etc).</p>
<p>        Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />        If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />      on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />      Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>        If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />      references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />      control problem irukke?</p>
<p>        Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />      according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />      case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>        Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />      patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />      proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record<br />      to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />      current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />      bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>        Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />      research anyway.</p>
<p>        Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />      survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />      story come by?</p>
<p>        I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />      all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />      sense.</p>
<p>        As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search of<br />      Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />      he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />      short cut :-).</p>
<p>        Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />      now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />      Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />        Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />      Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />      say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />      scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>          Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>          you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />          My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />      said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />          It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>          Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />      history.</p>
<p>          But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />      know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>          I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />      had year ago!</p>
<p>          I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />      believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />          Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />      what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />          Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />      against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />      other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />      finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />      welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>          Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />      labyrinth again.</p>

<p>            Dear Vairam</p>
<p>            Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />      and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />      have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>            However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />      anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />      line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />      similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>            I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />      Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />            Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />      Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />      study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>               He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />      the literature itself.</p>
<p>            For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />      and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />      foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />      not be so.</p>
<p>            Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />      entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />      Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />      Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>            As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />      adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>            I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />      noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />      Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />      poet.</p>
<p>            Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />      itself makes a mile of difference Ð¦ the usage of that term, on how a<br />      person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />      literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />      written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>            I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />      location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />      thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />      spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />      there, it is also difficult to prove Ð•it was not there.<br />            Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />      as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />      with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />      southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />      Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />      believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />      question posed before too.</p>
<p>            I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />      avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ð¦<br />      his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />      there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>            When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />      it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />      the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />      possible.</p>
<p>            Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />      this research?</p>
<p>            Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />      enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />      experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />      entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>               Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />      are.</p>
<p>            Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />      to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ð¦ purely due to his<br />      dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />      tread.</p>
<p>            However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />      relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>            Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />      literature Ð¦ just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />      bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />      these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />      awe.</p>
<p>            However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />      even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />            These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />      though many do not agree.</p>
<p>            PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some<br />      argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;</p>

<p>              Hi Ravi,<br />              Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />      in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />      various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />      He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>                Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />      research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />              I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />      of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />      Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />      members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />      left in these pages.</p>
<p>                I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />      cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />                It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />      base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />              Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />      been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />      Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />      knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />      work - The Eight Anthologies) .<br />              He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />      claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />      his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />      to an off spring of Sanskrit by scholars like KAN Shastri). From 1952 to<br />      nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />      Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />      out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />      biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />      <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>              So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />      you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />      your views on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

        <p>Draupadi's fraternal polyandry is metaphysically expalined by Malathi. But it is true Draupadi had real husbands, children and above all a real mother-in- law Kunti ! Pandavas, Hastinapur and Kurukshetra were very much part of history. </p>

<p>  <br />If virgin mary is a myth and draupadi's communion is metaphysical</p>
<p>The history vs myth questions that sound solid in my ears are</p>
<p>Who would be Karnan, Pandavas?</p>
<p>Which really complicates the next question.</p>
<p>How did the pandavas(who already seem a myth) have kids Prativindhya, Sutasoma, Srutakarman, Satanika, and Srutasena through a metaphysical communion?</p>

<p>  Â  <br />  Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just fyi I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>  Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysicallythe soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor forspiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi' , Draupadi wasattracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>    My English Professor, defined king as a small emperor and emperor as a<br />    big king.</p>
<p>    History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />    history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />    in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />    several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />    of Gandhi etc.)</p>

<p>      Hello Vairam</p>
<p>      Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />    the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />    etc).</p>
<p>      Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />      If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />    on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />    Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>      If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />    references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />    control problem irukke?</p>
<p>      Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />    according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />    case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>      Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />    patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />    proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record<br />    to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />    current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />    bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>      Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />    research anyway.</p>
<p>      Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />    survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />    story come by?</p>
<p>      I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />    all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />    sense.</p>
<p>      As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search of<br />    Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />    he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />    short cut :-).</p>
<p>      Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />    now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />    Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />      Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />    Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />    say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />    scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>        Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>        you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />        My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />    said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />        It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>        Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />    history.</p>
<p>        But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />    know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>        I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />    had year ago!</p>
<p>        I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />    believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />        Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />    what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />        Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />    against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />    other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />    finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />    welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>        Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />    labyrinth again.</p>

<p>          Dear Vairam</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />    and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />    have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>          However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />    anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />    line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />    similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>          I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />    Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />          Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />    Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />    study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>             He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />    the literature itself.</p>
<p>          For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />    and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />    foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />    not be so.</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />    entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />    Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />    Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>          As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />    adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>          I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />    noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />    Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />    poet.</p>
<p>          Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />    itself makes a mile of difference Ð¦ the usage of that term, on how a<br />    person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />    literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />    written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>          I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />    location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />    thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />    spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />    there, it is also difficult to prove Ð•it was not there.<br />          Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />    as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />    with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />    southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />    Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />    believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />    question posed before too.</p>
<p>          I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />    avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ð¦<br />    his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />    there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>          When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />    it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />    the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />    possible.</p>
<p>          Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />    this research?</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />    enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />    experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />    entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>             Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />    are.</p>
<p>          Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />    to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ð¦ purely dueto his<br />    dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />    tread.</p>
<p>          However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />    relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>          Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />    literature Ð¦ just as literature and not as an embodied sweatof<br />    bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />    these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />    awe.</p>
<p>          However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />    even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />          These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />    though many do not agree.</p>
<p>          PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some<br />    argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;          <br />          - R<br />          --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "vairam99" <vairam@  wrote:</p>
<p>            Hi Ravi,<br />            Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />    in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />    various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />    He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>              Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />    research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />            I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />    of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />    Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />    members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />    left in these pages.</p>
<p>              I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />    cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />              It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />    base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />            Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />    been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />    Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />    knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />    work - The Eight Anthologies) .<br />            He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />    claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />    his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />o<br />    nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />    Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />    out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />    biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />    <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>            So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />    you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />    your views on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>                     Maani-k-ka vasagar is perhaps oldest in the list of 63.</p>

<p>On future filming techniques</p></vairam@gmail.com></p>
<blockquote><p>  some time down the line animation will look as real as reality</p>
<p>  So from then on we need no actors</p>
<p>  MGR,Rajni,Kamal, Shivaji,Surya, Vikram can all be in cast of same movie</p>
<p>  Interacting films(its there in experimental stage now itself)</p></blockquote>
<p>Like the first scene can be Villan try to kill some one</p>
<p>now user can have choices</p>
<blockquote><p>  do u want villan to kill</p>
<p>   do u want police to stop</p>
<p>  do u want an into fight for hero</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on his choice movie will move forward.So within one movie itself usercan form diff combintations and watch diff movies! - this is the future ofCinema!</p>

<p>  Dear,Very interesting mail. After 500 years, two dimensional cinema may be improved toÂ  three dimensional cinema . What is my imaginationis that an actor could be seen as equal to a man/ woman in a TV cube. There may be option to select the actor for each role. As an example if we wantto see Dasavaratham with Rajini acting, it may be possible. Sridevi could be replaced for shreeya in Sivappu Rojakkal. All the 'Kar silaikal' are onedimensional cinema. Now we are enjoying two diemensional, as it is moving.We may have three dimension cinema as explained in future with various options.</p>
<p>  Now we are wondering of 'Kar silaikal' at Mahabalipuram and temples. The software Sivakamai Sabaptham developed by kalki help us to enjoy the great actor Sivakami in the Karsilaikal and the director his father who created them.Similarly our grand grand grand children would enjoy our two diminsional cinema by using appropriate software. Though there may technolgical improvement there may reduction of human values. Compared to earlier generationshuman values were reduced to a lowest level. Joint family is very rare nowa days. In future it may furter liqudiate or go down family concept may go. Â Our Subramaniapuram will tellÂ  the future generation the human values and affection existing at our time.YoursDr L KailasamÂ </p>

<p>    Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>    You are clearly getting confused with this topic.</p>
<p>    Let me start of with the basics,</p>
<p>    Karthigesu Sivathambi in his work"literary history of Tamil Literature"details the two modes of history through Literature.</p>
<p>    Literary History and History of Literature.</p>
<p>    Literary History:</p>
<p>    To study the literature to understand the people who have written the literature , their social status, their economic status, their pass times etc. Tamils 1800 years ago,Study in Tamil by Raghava Iyengar.</p>
<p>    All of Sangam Tamilians history is Literary History.</p>
<p>    Say lets take eg. lets take the Movie Subramaniya Puram. Suppose after some 500 years they see this movie.</p>
<p>    They would make observations like in 1980s they used to was pant and shirt , women used to were Sari. Around Madurai region there was lot of violence. Heaving beard was a style.Rajnikanth was a very popular actor.</p>
<p>    History of Literature:</p>
<p>    To study the history of the literature itself rather than the content of it. Books like Tamil Literature by Venugopala Pillai, History of Tamil Literature by Kamil Zvelebil,History of Tamil Literature by Jesudasan.</p>
<p>    This approach is like when people watch Subramaniyapuram 500 years later, they would observe(if they didnt know when the movie released)</p>
<p>    The movie must not have been taken in 1980s since</p>
<p>    The photography standards have improved</p>
<p>    It has heavy influence of Spanish cinema which is very late development</p>
<p>    The actor Sasi Kumar can also be found nearly in the same get up in film Nadodigal which is closely dates around 2010.</p>
<p>    The same can be said of other cast because all of them seem to be of the period around 2010.</p>
<p>    This film should have been released before the movie Pasanga,Mothi Vilayadu,Saroja because all these movie have mentioned Suramaniyapuram.</p>
<p>    SO Lower limit of the films age is around 2009 .</p>
<p>    The movie also seems to have been a realistic movie.This wave was supposedly started by a movie Kadhal. So the upper limit can be kept as 2005.</p>
<p>    So the movie should have been released in some where between 2007-2008.</p>
<p>    ----</p>
<p>    These are the available methods of study for Reader of History in literature. So it is not important for the history scholar to analyse the filming technique ( though he would touch on it to say - as an evidence) or production values or acting skills of the film.</p>
<p>    Reader of History can only do this much.</p>
<p>    If you want whole analysis of the film,then only a film critic can do it , or if you want to know the religious aspects of the film only religious expert can do it.</p>
<p>    History expert when taking a subject can write based only upon proven evidences or related to History in the above mentioned approaches. </p>
<p>    ---</p>
<p>    If your reader of literature or a Linguist you can give critical analysis on a subject. This is different from commentary.A critical analysis of Thirumanthiram would have what diseases are being discussed - comparison of the remedy with the present day remedies- all these.</p>
<p>    ---</p>
<p>    Dr.Zvelebil' s Tamil Literature- the one under discussion for the Alwarcontent is work of History on Tamil Literature.</p>
<p>    Smile of Murugan is work of linguist in trying to popularize a languagecalled Tamil to the world.</p>
<p>    His Murugan works:</p>
<p>    Tamil Traditions of Subrahmanya Murga -</p>
<p>    Chronicles all the legends and myths in first part and gives critical analysis on the sources.</p>
<p>    Thiru Murugan - </p>
<p>    Is set of 5 essays - it doesn't belong to any particular genre </p>
<p>    Because some essays are critical analysis,some are papers on Philosophy.</p>
<p>    Tamil Kandha Puranam - Short summary (in english) and critical Analysis.</p>
<p>    ---</p>
<p>    Now regarding Alwar- dating, his work is as a Historian. (Please see the Subramaniyapuram example of History of Literature). This work of his is unparallel and still today considered the reference for nearly all papers written on Tamil. </p>
<p>    So as a historian person would only look for history.As a Linguist and reader of literature would only look in finer aspects of the language.</p>
<p>    So to read Zvelebil and expect the philosophical depth or any thing other than History or as a reader of Literature would end up in a bad way. This failure is not contributed by the Author.</p>

<p>      Hello Vairam</p>
<p>      Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram etc).</p>
<p>      Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??). </p>
<p>      If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes senseon the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>      If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historicalreferences ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version control problem irukke?</p>
<p>      Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with... according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>      Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record toprove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>      Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this research anyway.</p>
<p>      Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with nosurvivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the storycome by?</p>
<p>      I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make sense.</p>
<p>      As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search ofMurugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where heis or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a short cut:-). </p>
<p>      Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was, now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.</p>
<p>      Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then sayThetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>        Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>        you seemed to have hijacked the topic.</p>
<p>        My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.</p>
<p>        It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>        Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or history.</p>
<p>        But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>        I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had year ago!</p>
<p>        I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.</p>
<p>        Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted. </p>
<p>        Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be heldagainst various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>        Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering thelabyrinth again.</p>

<p>          Dear Vairam</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count. </p>
<p>          However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it? </p>
<p>          I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong! </p>
<p>             He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature thanthe literature itself. </p>
<p>          For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga isnever complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>          As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>          I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while GuruArunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>          Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference Ð¦ the usage of that term, on how a person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>          I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spotsuch as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is also difficult to prove Ð•it was not there. </p>
<p>          Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southernvindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed beforetoo.</p>
<p>          I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ð¦ his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>          When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible.. </p>
<p>          Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<p>             Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p>
<p>          Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ð¦ purely due to his dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare totread.</p>
<p>          However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevant in all comparisons. </p>
<p>          Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read theseliterature Ð¦ just as literature and not as an embodied sweat ofbhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>          However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.</p>
<p>          These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,though many do not agree.</p>
<p>          PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514; </p>

<p>            Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>            Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating. He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>              Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. </p>
<p>            I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has left in thesepages.</p>
<p>              I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts. </p>
<p>              It is anything but natural that these researches would have abase line that starts with a western ideology.</p>
<p>            Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literaturethan the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my knowledge whohas done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great work - The Eight Anthologies) . </p>
<p>            He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived to a1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>            So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons fromyou , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear yourviews on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>                Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

<p>    <br />  Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just fyi I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>  Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysicallythe soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor forspiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi' , Draupadi wasattracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>    I fully agree with you, Ravi.</p>
<p>    My English Professor, defined king as a small emperor and emperor as a<br />    big king.</p>
<p>    History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />    history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />    in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />    several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />    of Gandhi etc.)</p>
<p>    It is preferable not to get swayed or bulldozed by the 'scientific' tag<br />    attached to extrapolated and biased versions of 'history'.</p>

<p>      Hello Vairam</p>
<p>      Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />    the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />    etc).</p>
<p>      Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />      If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />    on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />    Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>      If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />    references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />    control problem irukke?</p>
<p>      Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />    according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />    case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>      Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />    patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />    proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record<br />    to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />    current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />    bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>      Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />    research anyway.</p>
<p>      Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />    survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />    story come by?</p>
<p>      I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />    all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />    sense.</p>
<p>      As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search of<br />    Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />    he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />    short cut :-).</p>
<p>      Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />    now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />    Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />      Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />    Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />    say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />    scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>        Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>        you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />        My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />    said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />        It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>        Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />    history.</p>
<p>        But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />    know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>        I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />    had year ago!</p>
<p>        I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />    believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />        Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />    what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />        Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />    against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />    other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />    finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />    welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>        Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />    labyrinth again.</p>

<p>          Dear Vairam</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />    and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />    have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>          However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />    anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />    line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />    similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>          I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />    Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />          Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />    Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />    study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>             He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />    the literature itself.</p>
<p>          For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />    and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />    foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />    not be so.</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />    entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />    Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />    Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>          As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />    adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>          I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />    noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />    Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />    poet.</p>
<p>          Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />    itself makes a mile of difference Ц the usage of that term, on howa<br />    person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />    literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />    written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>          I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />    location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />    thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />    spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />    there, it is also difficult to prove Еit was not there.<br />          Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />    as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />    with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />    southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />    Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />    believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />    question posed before too.</p>
<p>          I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />    avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ц<br />    his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />    there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>          When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />    it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />    the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />    possible.</p>
<p>          Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />    this research?</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />    enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />    experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />    entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>             Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />    are.</p>
<p>          Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />    to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ц purely due to his<br />    dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />    tread.</p>
<p>          However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />    relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>          Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />    literature Ц just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />    bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />    these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />    awe.</p>
<p>          However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />    even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />          These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />    though many do not agree.</p>
<p>          PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some<br />    argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;          <br />          - R<br />          --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "vairam99" <vairam@  wrote:</p>
<p>            Hi Ravi,<br />            Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />    in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />    various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />    He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>              Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />    research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />            I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />    of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />    Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />    members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />    left in these pages.</p>
<p>              I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />    cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />              It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />    base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />            Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />    been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />    Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />    knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />    work - The Eight Anthologies) .<br />            He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />    claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />    his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />o<br />    nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />    Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />    out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />    biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />    <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>            So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />    you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />    your views on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>    <br />  Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just fyi I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>  Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysicallythe soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor forspiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi' , Draupadi wasattracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>    I fully agree with you, Ravi.</p>
<p>    My English Professor, defined king as a small emperor and emperor as a<br />    big king.</p>
<p>    History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />    history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />    in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />    several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />    of Gandhi etc.)</p>
<p>    It is preferable not to get swayed or bulldozed by the 'scientific' tag<br />    attached to extrapolated and biased versions of 'history'.</p>

<p>      Hello Vairam</p>
<p>      Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />    the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />    etc).</p>
<p>      Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />      If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />    on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />    Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>      If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />    references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />    control problem irukke?</p>
<p>      Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />    according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />    case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>      Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />    patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />    proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record<br />    to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />    current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />    bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>      Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />    research anyway.</p>
<p>      Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />    survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />    story come by?</p>
<p>      I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />    all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />    sense.</p>
<p>      As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search of<br />    Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />    he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />    short cut :-).</p>
<p>      Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />    now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />    Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />      Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />    Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />    say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />    scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>        Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>        you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />        My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />    said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />        It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>        Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />    history.</p>
<p>        But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />    know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>        I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />    had year ago!</p>
<p>        I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />    believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />        Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />    what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />        Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />    against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />    other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />    finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />    welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>        Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />    labyrinth again.</p>

<p>          Dear Vairam</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />    and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />    have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>          However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />    anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />    line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />    similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>          I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />    Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />          Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />    Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />    study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>             He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />    the literature itself.</p>
<p>          For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />    and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />    foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />    not be so.</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />    entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />    Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />    Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>          As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />    adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>          I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />    noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />    Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />    poet.</p>
<p>          Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />    itself makes a mile of difference Ц the usage of that term, on howa<br />    person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />    literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />    written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>          I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />    location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />    thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />    spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />    there, it is also difficult to prove Еit was not there.<br />          Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />    as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />    with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />    southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />    Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />    believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />    question posed before too.</p>
<p>          I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />    avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ц<br />    his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />    there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>          When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />    it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />    the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />    possible.</p>
<p>          Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />    this research?</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />    enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />    experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />    entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>             Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />    are.</p>
<p>          Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />    to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ц purely due to his<br />    dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />    tread.</p>
<p>          However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />    relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>          Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />    literature Ц just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />    bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />    these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />    awe.</p>
<p>          However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />    even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />          These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />    though many do not agree.</p>

<p>            Hi Ravi,<br />            Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />    in his book Tamil literature.

<p>              Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />    research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />            I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />    of his great work Tamil Literature.

So it would be really helpful to all<br />    members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />    left in these pages.</p>
<p>              I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />    cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />              It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />    base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />            Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />    been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />    Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />    knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />    work - The Eight Anthologies) .<br />            He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />    claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />    his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />o<br />    nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />    Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />    out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />    biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />    <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>            So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />    you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />    your views on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>              History does not account for various stories and tales of the<br />    bard, which seems to be having many lines of history before being sung.</p>
<p>              Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />    research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />              I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />    cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />              It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />    base line that starts with a western ideology.</p>
<p>              Nothing wrong, but then there are gaps that can derail a<br />    train.</p>

<p>                Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's<br />    Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating<br />    of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for<br />    dating of various literature.</p>

<p>Anyway, Dear Vairam</p>
<p>I get this concept of History of Literature and Literature's history, it would be easier if the agenda were to concern subramaniyapuram or so, but thehero of this topic seems to be Subramaniyan :-)</p>
<p>There is a 3rd view to literature, embedded information.This is a thin thread that does really string the actual jewels of these literature.Which apparently is not seen by many historians, some are exceptionally gifted in decoding it. </p>
<p>In context, it is like looking at subramaniyapuram as a movie, but we are talking the essence of subramaniyapuram - the reasoning for the story (Why) is different from the concept of the story (What) or the positioning of thestory (How).</p>
<p>My point is, history has a starting point, by terms of song/songs or books or what ever similar document. </p>
<p>This 'document' gets lost in transit and has multiple versions. Some dudes who are having a brighter brain power are able to come up with documentation as per their standards of thoughts.</p>
<p>Now researching these documents are fantastic and enterprising, though the base line virtually throws a lot of light into what comes as a finished product.</p>
<p>If I were to look at Murugan only as a human who was a bearded hunter who wooed valli in the forest of Kurinji, that would be a nice amar chitra kathatale. The problem here is, that is just one of the many faces of murugan. By virtue of possessing an energy force is not the same as becoming one (Relativity theory).</p>
<p>Murugan, as said by the real biography writers of His Lords story, Guru Arunagiri or Sivachariyar or Nakkiran have clearly identified these jewels in their works. Infact, Guru Arunagiri goes a step further and talking about Anubuthi, the translation of Dr.Zvelebil effectively misses the concept(Jewel) I had explained earlier in the verse 51 pointer.</p>
<p>Literature without understanding of its soul(Why) becomes a fossil, while one reads it with life, it is a beautiful flower that fragrant forever.</p>
<p>I believe post mortem reports are for dead people,I am looking for the life.I certainly, am not confused in this aspect :-)</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>  You are clearly getting confused with this topic.<br />  Let me start of with the basics,</p>
<p>  Karthigesu Sivathambi in his work"literary history of Tamil Literature" details the two modes of history through Literature.</p>
<p>  Literary History and History of Literature.</p>
<p>  Literary History:<br />  To study the literature to understand the people who have written the literature , their social status, their economic status, their pass times etc.Tamils 1800 years ago,Study in Tamil by Raghava Iyengar.<br />  All of Sangam Tamilians history is Literary History.</p>
<p>  Say lets take eg. lets take the Movie Subramaniya Puram. Suppose after some 500 years they see this movie.<br />  They would make observations like in 1980s they used to was pant and shirt , women used to were Sari. Around Madurai region there was lot of violence. Heaving beard was a style.Rajnikanth was a very popular actor.</p>
<p>  History of Literature:<br />  To study the history of the literature itself rather than the content of it. Books like Tamil Literature by Venugopala Pillai, History of Tamil Literature by Kamil Zvelebil,History of Tamil Literature by Jesudasan.</p>
<p>  This approach is like when people watch Subramaniyapuram 500 years later,they would observe(if they didnt know when the movie released)<br />  The movie must not have been taken in 1980s since<br />  The photography standards have improved<br />  It has heavy influence of Spanish cinema which is very late development<br />  The actor Sasi Kumar can also be found nearly in the same get up in film Nadodigal which is closely dates around 2010.<br />  The same can be said of other cast because all of them seem to be of the period around 2010.<br />  This film should have been released before the movie Pasanga,Mothi Vilayadu,Saroja because all these movie have mentioned Suramaniyapuram.<br />  SO Lower limit of the films age is around 2009 .<br />  The movie also seems to have been a realistic movie.This wave was supposedly started by a movie Kadhal. So the upper limit can be kept as 2005.<br />  So the movie should have been released in some where between 2007-2008.</p>
<p>  ----<br />  These are the available methods of study for Reader of History in literature. So it is not important for the history scholar to analyse the filming technique ( though he would touch on it to say - as an evidence) or production values or acting skills of the film.<br />  Reader of History can only do this much.</p>
<p>  If you want whole analysis of the film,then only a film critic can do it , or if you want to know the religious aspects of the film only religious expert can do it.</p>
<p>  History expert when taking a subject can write based only upon proven evidences or related to History in the above mentioned approaches. </p>
<p>  ---<br />  If your reader of literature or a Linguist you can give critical analysison a subject. This is different from commentary.A critical analysis of Thirumanthiram would have what diseases are being discussed - comparison of the remedy with the present day remedies- all these.<br />  ---</p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil's Tamil Literature- the one under discussion for the Alwar content is work of History on Tamil Literature.</p>
<p>  Smile of Murugan is work of linguist in trying to popularize a language called Tamil to the world.</p>
<p>  His Murugan works:<br />  Tamil Traditions of Subrahmanya Murga -<br />  Chronicles all the legends and myths in first part and gives critical analysis on the sources.<br />  Thiru Murugan - <br />  Is set of 5 essays - it doesn't belong to any particular genre <br />  Because some essays are critical analysis,some are papers on Philosophy.<br />  Tamil Kandha Puranam - Short summary (in english) and critical Analysis.</p>
<p>  ---</p>
<p>  Now regarding Alwar- dating, his work is as a Historian. (Please see the Subramaniyapuram example of History of Literature). This work of his is unparallel and still today considered the reference for nearly all papers written on Tamil. </p>
<p>  So as a historian person would only look for history.As a Linguist and reader of literature would only look in finer aspects of the language.</p>
<p>  So to read Zvelebil and expect the philosophical depth or any thing otherthan History or as a reader of Literature would end up in a bad way. This failure is not contributed by the Author.</p>

<p>    Hello Vairam</p>
<p>    Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram etc).</p>
<p>    Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??). <br />    If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>    If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version control problem irukke?</p>
<p>    Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with... according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this case,historyhas no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>    Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be proper in its explanations.And historians must have a convincing record to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our current humanmind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>    Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this research anyway.</p>
<p>    Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the story come by?</p>
<p>    I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make sense.</p>
<p>    As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil(rest his soul), I am in search of Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where he isor what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a short cut :-). </p>
<p>    Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was, now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />    Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>      Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>      you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />      My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />      It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>      Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or history.</p>
<p>      But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>      I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had year ago!</p>
<p>      I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />      Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted. <br />      Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to welcome it. Archeology,numismatic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>      Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the labyrinth again.</p>

<p>        Dear Vairam</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west andstudied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count. </p>
<p>        However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it? </p>
<p>        I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of TrojanWar (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />        Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong! </p>
<p>           He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. </p>
<p>        For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature andhistory of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>        As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>        I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>        Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference ? the usage of that term, on how a person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>        I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is also difficult to prove ?it was not there. <br />        Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed before too.</p>
<p>        I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age ? his time lineof alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>        When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it)was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible. </p>
<p>        Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<p>           Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p>
<p>        Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed ? purely due to his dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to tread.</p>
<p>        However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevant in all comparisons. </p>
<p>        Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these literature ? just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>        However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic, even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />        These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions, though many do not agree.</p>
<p>        PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514; </p>

<p>          Hi Ravi,<br />          Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data inhis book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by variousscholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating. He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>            Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. <br />          I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161 of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all members ofthe group if you can let us know the important gaps he has left in these pages.</p>
<p>            I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and culturalonset prior to researching dravidian scripts. <br />            It is anything but natural that these researches would have a base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />          Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never beencontroversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great work - The Eight Anthologies). <br />          He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived to an 990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog <a href="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html" title="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html">http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html</a></p>
<p>          So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear your views on Dr.Zvelebil's works.</p>

<p>              Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

<p>    Hi Maloo</p>
<p>    I think its a question of generating interest. the human mind likes stuff that tickles the intellect.</p>
<p>    like imagining a ten headed man. the logical next step is what would he do if he had a head ache( saridon stole the idea for an ad)</p>
<p>    so a dollop of imagination added to history  every time the story is repeated takes it further away from the original.</p>
<p>    venketesh</p>
<p>     Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just fyi I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>        Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysically the soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor for spiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi' , Draupadi was attracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue.

<p>            Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).</p>

<p>          Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>            If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical</p>
<p>          references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version</p>
<p>          control problem irukke?</p>
<p>            Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...</p>
<p>          according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this</p>
<p>          case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>            Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many</p>
<p>          patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be</p>
<p>          proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record</p>
<p>          to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our</p>
<p>          current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a</p>
<p>          bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>            Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this</p>
<p>          research anyway.</p>
<p>            Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no</p>
<p>          survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the</p>
<p>          story come by?</p>
<p>            I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question</p>

<p>            Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,</p>
<p>          now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or</p>
<p>          Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.</p>
<p>            Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because</p>
<p>          Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then</p>
<p>          say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our</p>

<p>              Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>              you seemed to have hijacked the topic.</p>
<p>              My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You</p>
<p>          said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.</p>
<p>              It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>              Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or</p>
<p>          history.</p>
<p>              But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to</p>
<p>          know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>              I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we</p>
<p>          had year ago!</p>
<p>              I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a</p>
<p>          believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.</p>
<p>              Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and</p>
<p>          what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.</p>
<p>              Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held</p>
<p>          against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and</p>
<p>          other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If</p>
<p>          finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to</p>
<p>          welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>              Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the</p>
<p>          labyrinth again.</p>

<p>                Dear Vairam</p>
<p>                Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west</p>
<p>          and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I</p>
<p>          have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>                However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for</p>
<p>          anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base</p>
<p>          line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something</p>
<p>          similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>                I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of</p>
<p>          Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).</p>
<p>                Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the</p>
<p>          Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative</p>
<p>          study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>                   He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than</p>
<p>          the literature itself.</p>
<p>                For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature</p>
<p>          and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological</p>
<p>          foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may</p>
<p>          not be so.</p>
<p>                Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is</p>
<p>          entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on</p>
<p>          Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru</p>
<p>          Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>                As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,</p>
<p>          adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>                I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I</p>
<p>          noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while</p>
<p>          Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple</p>
<p>          poet.</p>
<p>                Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by</p>
<p>          itself makes a mile of difference Ð¦ the usage of that term, on how a</p>
<p>          person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between</p>
<p>          literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had</p>
<p>          written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>                I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the</p>
<p>          location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such</p>
<p>          thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a</p>
<p>          spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was</p>
<p>          there, it is also difficult to prove Ð•it was not there.</p>
<p>                Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran</p>
<p>          as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,</p>
<p>          with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the</p>
<p>          southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the</p>
<p>          Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I</p>
<p>          believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this</p>
<p>          question posed before too.</p>
<p>                I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru</p>
<p>          avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ð¦</p>
<p>          his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why</p>
<p>          there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>                When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below</p>
<p>          it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,</p>
<p>          the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite</p>
<p>          possible.</p>
<p>                Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all</p>
<p>          this research?</p>
<p>                Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble</p>
<p>          enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the</p>
<p>          experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am</p>
<p>          entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>                   Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we</p>
<p>          are.</p>
<p>                Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research</p>
<p>          to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ð¦ purely due to his</p>
<p>          dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to</p>
<p>          tread.</p>
<p>                However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very</p>
<p>          relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>                Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these</p>
<p>          literature Ð¦ just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of</p>
<p>          bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of</p>
<p>          these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with</p>
<p>          awe.</p>
<p>                However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,</p>
<p>          even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.</p>
<p>                These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,</p>
<p>          though many do not agree.</p>
<p>                PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some</p>
<p>          argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;</p>

<p>                  Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>                  Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data</p>
<p>          in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by</p>
<p>          various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.</p>
<p>          He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>                    Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and</p>
<p>          research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.</p>
<p>                  I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161</p>
<p>          of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all</p>
<p>          Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all</p>
<p>          members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has</p>
<p>          left in these pages.</p>
<p>                    I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and</p>
<p>          cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.</p>
<p>                    It is anything but natural that these researches would have a</p>
<p>          base line that starts with a western ideology.</p>
<p>                  Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never</p>
<p>          been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil</p>
<p>          Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my</p>
<p>          knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great</p>
<p>          work - The Eight Anthologies) .</p>
<p>                  He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the</p>
<p>          claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of</p>
<p>          his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived</p>
<p>          to an off spring of Sanskrit by scholars like KAN Shastri). From 1952 to</p>
<p>          nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of</p>
<p>          Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed</p>
<p>          out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short</p>
<p>          biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog</p>
<p>          <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>                  So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from</p>
<p>          you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear</p>
<p>          your views on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>  I think its a question of generating interest. the human mind likes stuffthat tickles the intellect.</p>
<p>  like imagining a ten headed man. the logical next step is what would he do if he had a head ache( saridon stole the idea for an ad)</p>

<p>  Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was avirgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just fyi I am not a history buff like Vairam I am moreinto myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>      Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysically the soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysicalmeaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphorfor spiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi' , Draupadiwas attracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>          Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed</p>
<p>        the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram</p>
<p>        etc).</p>
<p>          Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).</p>
<p>          If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense</p>
<p>        on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>          If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical</p>
<p>        references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version</p>
<p>        control problem irukke?</p>
<p>          Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...</p>
<p>        according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this</p>
<p>        case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>          Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history hasmany</p>
<p>        patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be</p>
<p>        proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record</p>
<p>        to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our</p>
<p>        current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a</p>
<p>        bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>          Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this</p>
<p>        research anyway.</p>
<p>          Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no</p>
<p>        survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the</p>
<p>        story come by?</p>
<p>          I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question</p>
<p>        all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make</p>
<p>        sense.</p>
<p>          As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search of</p>
<p>        Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where</p>
<p>        he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a</p>
<p>        short cut :-).</p>
<p>          Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,</p>
<p>        now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or</p>
<p>        Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.</p>
<p>          Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because</p>
<p>        Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then</p>
<p>        say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our</p>
<p>        scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>            I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You area</p>
<p>        believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.</p>
<p>            Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and</p>
<p>        what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.</p>
<p>            Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held</p>

<p>              Dear Vairam</p>
<p>              Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west</p>
<p>        and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine.I</p>
<p>        have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>              However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for</p>
<p>        anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base</p>
<p>        line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something</p>
<p>        similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>              I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of</p>
<p>        Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).</p>
<p>              Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the</p>
<p>        Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative</p>
<p>        study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>                 He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than</p>
<p>        the literature itself.</p>
<p>              For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature</p>
<p>        and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological</p>
<p>        foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may</p>
<p>        not be so.</p>
<p>              Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is</p>
<p>        entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on</p>
<p>        Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru</p>
<p>        Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>              As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,</p>
<p>        adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>              I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works.I</p>
<p>        noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while</p>
<p>        Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple</p>
<p>        poet.</p>
<p>              Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by</p>
<p>        itself makes a mile of difference Ð¦ the usage of that term, on how a</p>
<p>        person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between</p>
<p>        literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had</p>
<p>        written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>              I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the</p>
<p>        location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such</p>
<p>        thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a</p>
<p>        spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was</p>
<p>        there, it is also difficult to prove Ð•it was not there.</p>
<p>              Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran</p>
<p>        as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,</p>
<p>        with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the</p>
<p>        southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the</p>
<p>        Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I</p>
<p>        believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this</p>
<p>        question posed before too.</p>
<p>              I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru</p>
<p>        avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ð¦</p>
<p>        his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why</p>
<p>        there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>              When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below</p>
<p>        it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,</p>
<p>        the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite</p>
<p>        possible.</p>
<p>              Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all</p>
<p>        this research?</p>
<p>              Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble</p>
<p>        enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the</p>
<p>        experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am</p>
<p>        entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>                 Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we</p>
<p>        are.</p>
<p>              Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research</p>
<p>        to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ð¦ purelydue to his</p>
<p>        dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to</p>
<p>        tread.</p>
<p>              However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very</p>
<p>        relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>              Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these</p>
<p>        literature Ð¦ just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of</p>
<p>        bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of</p>
<p>        these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with</p>
<p>        awe.</p>
<p>              However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,</p>
<p>        even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.</p>
<p>              These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,</p>
<p>        though many do not agree.</p>
<p>              PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some</p>
<p>        argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;</p>

<p>                Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>                Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data</p>

<p>                I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to161</p>
<p>        of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating ofall</p>

<p>        members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has</p>
<p>        left in these pages.</p>
<p>                  I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and</p>
<p>        cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.</p>
<p>                  It is anything but natural that these researches would have a</p>
<p>        base line that starts with a western ideology.</p>
<p>                Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never</p>
<p>        been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil</p>
<p>        Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my</p>
<p>        knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great</p>
<p>        work - The Eight Anthologies) .</p>
<p>                He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the</p>
<p>        claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of</p>
<p>        his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived</p></vairam@></p></ravi_eds@></p></ravi_eds@></p></sampath_srinivasar></p></blockquote>

<p>                  History does not account for various stories and tales ofthe</p>
<p>        bard, which seems to be having many lines of history before being sung.</p>
<p>                  Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and</p>
<p>        research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.</p>
<p>                  I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and</p>
<p>        cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.</p>
<p>                  It is anything but natural that these researches would have a</p>
<p>        base line that starts with a western ideology.</p>
<p>                  Nothing wrong, but then there are gaps that can derail a</p>

<p>                    Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's</p>
<p>        Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating</p>
<p>        of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for</p>
<p>        dating of various literature.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear,Very interesting mail. After 500 years, two dimensional cinema may be improved to  three dimensional cinema . What is my imagination is that an actor could be seen as equal to a man/ woman in a TV cube. There may be option to select the actor for each role. As an example if we want to see Dasavaratham with Rajini acting, it may be possible. Sridevi could be replaced for shreeya in Sivappu Rojakkal. All the 'Kar silaikal' are one dimensional cinema. Now we are enjoying two diemensional, as it is moving. We may have three dimension cinema as explained in future with various options.<br />  Now we are wondering of 'Kar silaikal' at Mahabalipuram and temples. The software Sivakamai Sabaptham developed by kalki help us to enjoy the great actor Sivakami in the Karsilaikal and the director his father who created them.Similarly our grand grand grand children would enjoy our two diminsional cinema by using appropriate software. Though there may technolgical improvement there may reduction of human values. Compared to earlier generationshuman values were reduced to a lowest level. Joint family is very rare nowa days. In future it may furter liqudiate or go down family concept may go.  Our Subramaniapuram will tell  the future generation the humanvalues and affection existing at our time.YoursDr L Kailasam <br />  --- On Tue, 1/9/09, sps10142004 <sps10142004@...  wrote:</p>

<p>    Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>    You are clearly getting confused with this topic.</p>
<p>    Let me start of with the basics,</p>
<p>    Karthigesu Sivathambi in his work"literary history of Tamil Literature"details the two modes of history through Literature.</p>
<p>    Literary History and History of Literature.</p>
<p>    Literary History:</p>
<p>    To study the literature to understand the people who have written the literature , their social status, their economic status, their pass times etc. Tamils 1800 years ago,Study in Tamil by Raghava Iyengar.</p>
<p>    All of Sangam Tamilians history is Literary History.</p>
<p>    Say lets take eg. lets take the Movie Subramaniya Puram. Suppose after some 500 years they see this movie.</p>
<p>    They would make observations like in 1980s they used to was pant and shirt , women used to were Sari. Around Madurai region there was lot of violence. Heaving beard was a style.Rajnikanth was a very popular actor.</p>
<p>    History of Literature:</p>
<p>    To study the history of the literature itself rather than the content of it. Books like Tamil Literature by Venugopala Pillai, History of Tamil Literature by Kamil Zvelebil,History of Tamil Literature by Jesudasan.</p>
<p>    This approach is like when people watch Subramaniyapuram 500 years later, they would observe(if they didnt know when the movie released)</p>
<p>    The movie must not have been taken in 1980s since</p>
<p>    The photography standards have improved</p>
<p>    It has heavy influence of Spanish cinema which is very late development</p>
<p>    The actor Sasi Kumar can also be found nearly in the same get up in film Nadodigal which is closely dates around 2010.</p>
<p>    The same can be said of other cast because all of them seem to be of the period around 2010.</p>
<p>    This film should have been released before the movie Pasanga,Mothi Vilayadu,Saroja because all these movie have mentioned Suramaniyapuram.</p>
<p>    SO Lower limit of the films age is around 2009 .</p>
<p>    The movie also seems to have been a realistic movie.This wave was supposedly started by a movie Kadhal. So the upper limit can be kept as 2005.</p>
<p>    So the movie should have been released in some where between 2007-2008.</p>
<p>    ----</p>
<p>    These are the available methods of study for Reader of History in literature. So it is not important for the history scholar to analyse the filming technique ( though he would touch on it to say - as an evidence) or production values or acting skills of the film.</p>
<p>    Reader of History can only do this much.</p>
<p>    If you want whole analysis of the film,then only a film critic can do it , or if you want to know the religious aspects of the film only religious expert can do it.</p>
<p>    History expert when taking a subject can write based only upon proven evidences or related to History in the above mentioned approaches. </p>
<p>    ---</p>
<p>    If your reader of literature or a Linguist you can give critical analysis on a subject. This is different from commentary.A critical analysis of Thirumanthiram would have what diseases are being discussed - comparison of the remedy with the present day remedies- all these.</p>
<p>    ---</p>
<p>    Dr.Zvelebil' s Tamil Literature- the one under discussion for the Alwarcontent is work of History on Tamil Literature.</p>
<p>    Smile of Murugan is work of linguist in trying to popularize a languagecalled Tamil to the world.</p>
<p>    His Murugan works:</p>
<p>    Tamil Traditions of Subrahmanya Murga -</p>
<p>    Chronicles all the legends and myths in first part and gives critical analysis on the sources.</p>
<p>    Thiru Murugan - </p>
<p>    Is set of 5 essays - it doesn't belong to any particular genre </p>
<p>    Because some essays are critical analysis,some are papers on Philosophy.</p>
<p>    Tamil Kandha Puranam - Short summary (in english) and critical Analysis.</p>
<p>    ---</p>
<p>    Now regarding Alwar- dating, his work is as a Historian. (Please see the Subramaniyapuram example of History of Literature). This work of his is unparallel and still today considered the reference for nearly all papers written on Tamil. </p>
<p>    So as a historian person would only look for history.As a Linguist and reader of literature would only look in finer aspects of the language.</p>
<p>    So to read Zvelebil and expect the philosophical depth or any thing other than History or as a reader of Literature would end up in a bad way. This failure is not contributed by the Author.</p>

<p>      Hello Vairam</p>
<p>      Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram etc).</p>
<p>      Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??). </p>
<p>      If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes senseon the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>      If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historicalreferences ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version control problem irukke?</p>
<p>      Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with... according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>      Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record toprove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>      Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this research anyway.</p>
<p>      Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with nosurvivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the storycome by?</p>
<p>      I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make sense.</p>
<p>      As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search ofMurugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where heis or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a short cut:-). </p>
<p>      Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was, now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.</p>
<p>      Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then sayThetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>        Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>        you seemed to have hijacked the topic.</p>
<p>        My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.</p>
<p>        It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>        Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or history.</p>
<p>        But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>        I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had year ago!</p>
<p>        I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.</p>
<p>        Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted. </p>
<p>        Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be heldagainst various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>        Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering thelabyrinth again.</p>

<p>          Dear Vairam</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count. </p>
<p>          However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it? </p>
<p>          I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong! </p>
<p>             He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature thanthe literature itself. </p>
<p>          For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga isnever complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>          As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>          I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while GuruArunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>          Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference Ц the usage of that term, on how a person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about thisearlier too.</p>
<p>          I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spotsuch as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is also difficult to prove Еit was not there. </p>
<p>          Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southernvindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed beforetoo.</p>
<p>          I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ц his timeline of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>          When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible. </p>
<p>          Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<p>             Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p>
<p>          Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ц purely due to his dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to tread.</p>
<p>          However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevant in all comparisons. </p>
<p>          Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read theseliterature Ц just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>          However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.</p>
<p>          These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,though many do not agree.</p>

<p>            Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>            Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating. He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>              Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. </p>
<p>            I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has left in thesepages.</p>
<p>              I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts. </p>
<p>              It is anything but natural that these researches would have abase line that starts with a western ideology.</p>
<p>            Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literaturethan the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my knowledge whohas done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great work - The Eight Anthologies) . </p>
<p>            He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived to a1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>            So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons fromyou , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear yourviews on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>                Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

<p>  Hi Maloo<br />  I think its a question of generating interest. the human mind likes stuffthat tickles the intellect.<br />  like imagining a ten headed man. the logical next step is what would he do if he had a head ache( saridon stole the idea for an ad)<br />  so a dollop of imagination added to history every time the story is repeated takes it further away from the original.</p>
<p>  venketesh</p>
<p>  Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was avirgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just fyi I am not a history buff like Vairam I am moreinto myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>      Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysically the soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysicalmeaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphorfor spiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi' , Draupadiwas attracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

Myth is also history<br />        in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />        several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />        of Gandhi etc.)</p>
<p>        It is preferable not to get swayed or bulldozed by the 'scientific'tag<br />        attached to extrapolated and biased versions of 'history'.</p>

<p>          Hello Vairam</p>
<p>          Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />        the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />        etc).</p>
<p>          Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />          If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />        on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />        Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>          If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />        references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />        control problem irukke?</p>
<p>          Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />        according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />        case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>          Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history hasmany<br />        patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />        proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record<br />        to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />        current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />        bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>          Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />        research anyway.</p>
<p>          Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />        survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />        story come by?</p>
<p>          I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />        all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />        sense.</p>
<p>          As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search of<br />        Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />        he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />        short cut :-).</p>
<p>          Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />        now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />        Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />          Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />        Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />        say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />        scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>            Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>            you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />            My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />        said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />            It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>            Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its mythor<br />        history.</p>
<p>            But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would liketo<br />        know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>            I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />        had year ago!</p>
<p>            I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You area<br />        believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />            Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />        what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />            Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />        against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />        other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />        finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />        welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>            Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are enteringthe<br />        labyrinth again.</p>

<p>              Dear Vairam</p>
<p>              Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />        and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine.I<br />        have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>              However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />        anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />        line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />        similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>              I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />        Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />              Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />        Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />        study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>                 He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />        the literature itself.</p>
<p>              For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />        and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />        foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />        not be so.</p>
<p>              Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />        entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />        Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />        Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>              As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />        adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>              I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works.I<br />        noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />        Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />        poet.</p>
<p>              Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />        itself makes a mile of difference Ц the usage of that term, onhow a<br />        person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />        literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />        written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>              I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />        location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />        thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />        spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />        there, it is also difficult to prove Еit was not there.<br />              Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />        as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />        with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />        southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />        Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />        believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />        question posed before too.</p>
<p>              I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />        avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ц<br />        his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />        there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>              When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />        it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />        the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />        possible.</p>
<p>              Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />        this research?</p>
<p>              Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />        enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />        experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />        entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>                 Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />        are.</p>
<p>              Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />        to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ц purely due to his<br />        dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />        tread.</p>
<p>              However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />        relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>              Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />        literature Ц just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />        bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />        these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />        awe.</p>
<p>              However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />        even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />              These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />        though many do not agree.</p>
<p>              PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some<br />        argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;              <br />              - R<br />              --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "vairam99" <vairam@ wrote:</p>
<p>                Hi Ravi,<br />                Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />        in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />        various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />        He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>                  Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />        research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />                I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to161<br />        of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating ofall<br />        Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />        members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />        left in these pages.</p>
<p>                  I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />        cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />                  It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />        base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />                Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />        been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />        Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />        knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />        work - The Eight Anthologies) .<br />                He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />        claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />        his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />52 to<br />        nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />        Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />        out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />        biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />        <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>                So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />        you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />        your views on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>  Vairam - your post was excellent. But what if only prints of <br />  subramaniyapuram is available after 500 years and no print of other <br />  movies you specified are available, what will be the research <br />  output? definitely a wrong conclusion. So is our current history <br />  knowledge.</p>
<p>  One of the best philosophical movie I have seen is the 'BEE MOVIE'. <br />  Pixar needs no introduction for their story boards. Cars and Bee <br />  Movie are my favourite as it has very good philosophy. Especially <br />  Bee Movie...I think the story is inspired by Gita. The message - do <br />  your duty without looking at other aspects and the world will be <br />  real good.</p>
<p>  The movie starts with the caption, even before the title - "AS PER <br />  THE KNOWN LAWS OF AERODYNAMICS, BEE CANNOT FLY, BECAUSE THE BODY OF <br />  THE BEE WITH ITS SMALL WINGS AND LARGE BODY IS NOT SUITABLE FOR <br />  FLYING.</p>
<p>  BUT STILL BEE'S FLY.....BECAUSE BEE'S DO NOT BOTHER ABOUT WHAT <br />  HUMANS THINK"</p>
<p>  what a great philosophy...reflecting avvai's katrathy kai man alavu.</p>
<p>  and we fight over petty things in the name of history and myth... :)</p>

<blockquote><p>    Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time,both are true, not necessarily one or the other.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hi Maloo<br />I think its a question of generating interest. the human mind likes stuff that tickles the intellect.<br />like imagining a ten headed man. the logical next step is what would he do if he had a head ache( saridon stole the idea for an ad)<br />so a dollop of imagination added to history every time the story is repeated takes it further away from the original.</p>
<p>I am sure RRc would have been a lot different from ponniyin selvan we knew.</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<p>Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just fyi I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<blockquote><p>    Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysically the soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor for spiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi' , Draupadi was attracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>      I fully agree with you, Ravi.</p>
<p>      My English Professor, defined king as a small emperor and emperor as a<br />      big king.</p>
<p>      History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />      history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />      in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />      several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />      of Gandhi etc.)</p>
<p>      It is preferable not to get swayed or bulldozed by the 'scientific' tag<br />      attached to extrapolated and biased versions of 'history'.</p>

<p>        Hello Vairam</p>
<p>        Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />      the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />      etc).</p>
<p>        Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />        If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />      on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />      Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>        If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />      references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />      control problem irukke?</p>
<p>        Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />      according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />      case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>        Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />      patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUSTbe<br />      proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record<br />      to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />      current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this isa<br />      bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>        Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />      research anyway.</p>
<p>        Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />      survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />      story come by?</p>
<p>        I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />      all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />      sense.</p>
<p>        As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search of<br />      Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />      he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />      short cut :-).</p>
<p>        Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />      now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />      Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />        Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />      Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />      say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />      scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>          Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>          you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />          My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />      said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />          It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>          Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />      history.</p>
<p>          But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />      know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>          I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debatewe<br />      had year ago!</p>
<p>          I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />      believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />          Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />      what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />          Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />      against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />      other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />      finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am hereto<br />      welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>          Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />      labyrinth again.</p>

<p>            Dear Vairam</p>
<p>            Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />      and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />      have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>            However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />      anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />      line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />      similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>            I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />      Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />            Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />      Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />      study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>               He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />      the literature itself.</p>
<p>            For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />      and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />      foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />      not be so.</p>
<p>            Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />      entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />      Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />      Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>            As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />      adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>            I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />      noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />      Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />      poet.</p>
<p>            Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />      itself makes a mile of difference Ц the usage of that term, on how a<br />      person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />      literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />      written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>            I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />      location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />      thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />      spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />      there, it is also difficult to prove Еit was not there.<br />            Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />      as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />      with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />      southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />      Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />      believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />      question posed before too.</p>
<p>            I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />      avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ц<br />      his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />      there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>            When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />      it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />      the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />      possible.</p>
<p>            Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />      this research?</p>
<p>            Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />      enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />      experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />      entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>               Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian thanwe<br />      are.</p>
<p>            Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />      to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ц purely due to his<br />      dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />      tread.</p>
<p>            However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />      relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>            Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />      literature Ц just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />      bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />      these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />      awe.</p>
<p>            However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />      even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />            These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />      though many do not agree.</p>
<p>            PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some<br />      argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;            <br />            - R<br />            --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "vairam99" <vairam@  wrote:</p>
<p>              Hi Ravi,<br />              Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />      in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />      various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />      He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>                Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />      research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />              I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />      of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />      Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />      members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />      left in these pages.</p>
<p>                I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />      cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />                It is anything but natural that these researches would havea<br />      base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />              Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />      been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />      Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />      knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />      work - The Eight Anthologies) .<br />              He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />      claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every bookof<br />      his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />to<br />      nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />      Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />      out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />      biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />      <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>              So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />      you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />      your views on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>                History does not account for various stories and tales of the<br />      bard, which seems to be having many lines of history before being sung.</p>
<p>                Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />      research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />                I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />      cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />                It is anything but natural that these researches would havea<br />      base line that starts with a western ideology.</p>

<p>                  Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's<br />      Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating<br />      of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for<br />      dating of various literature.</p>

<p>    <br />  Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just fyi I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>  Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysicallythe soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor forspiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi' , Draupadi wasattracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>    My English Professor, defined king as a small emperor and emperor as a<br />    big king.</p>
<p>    History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />    history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />    in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />    several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />    of Gandhi etc.)</p>

<p>      Hello Vairam</p>
<p>      Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />    the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />    etc).</p>
<p>      Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />      If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />    on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />    Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>      If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />    references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />    control problem irukke?</p>
<p>      Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />    according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />    case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>      Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />    patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />    proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record<br />    to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />    current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />    bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>      Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />    research anyway.</p>
<p>      Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />    survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />    story come by?</p>
<p>      I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />    all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />    sense.</p>
<p>      As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search of<br />    Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />    he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />    short cut :-).</p>
<p>      Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />    now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />    Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />      Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />    Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />    say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />    scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>        Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>        you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />        My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />    said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />        It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>        Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />    history.</p>
<p>        But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />    know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>        I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />    had year ago!</p>
<p>        I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />    believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />        Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />    what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />        Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />    against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />    other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />    finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />    welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>        Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />    labyrinth again.</p>

<p>          Dear Vairam</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />    and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />    have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>          However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />    anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />    line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />    similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>          I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />    Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />          Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />    Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />    study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>             He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />    the literature itself.</p>
<p>          For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />    and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />    foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />    not be so.</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />    entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />    Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />    Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>          As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />    adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>          I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />    noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />    Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />    poet.</p>
<p>          Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />    itself makes a mile of difference Ц the usage of that term, on howa<br />    person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />    literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />    written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>          I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />    location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />    thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />    spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />    there, it is also difficult to prove Еit was not there.<br />          Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />    as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />    with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />    southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />    Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />    believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />    question posed before too.</p>
<p>          I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />    avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ц<br />    his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />    there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>          When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />    it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />    the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />    possible.</p>
<p>          Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />    this research?</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />    enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />    experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />    entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>             Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />    are.</p>
<p>          Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />    to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ц purely due to his<br />    dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />    tread.</p>
<p>          However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />    relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>          Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />    literature Ц just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />    bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />    these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />    awe.</p>
<p>          However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />    even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />          These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />    though many do not agree.</p>
<p>          PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some<br />    argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;          <br />          - R<br />          --- In ponniyinselvan@ yahoogroups. com, "vairam99" <vairam@  wrote:</p>
<p>            Hi Ravi,<br />            Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />    in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />    various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />    He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>              Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />    research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />            I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />    of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />    Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />    members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />    left in these pages.</p>
<p>              I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />    cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />              It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />    base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />            Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />    been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />    Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />    knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />    work - The Eight Anthologies) .<br />            He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />    claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />    his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />o<br />    nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />    Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />    out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />    biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />    <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>            So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />    you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />    your views on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>                Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's<br />    Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating<br />    of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for<br />    dating of various literature.</p>

<p>Just being Casual... Vairam's point well taken,</p>
<p>regards / sps </p>
<p>What is my imagination is that an actor could be seen as equal to a man/ woman in a TV cube. There may be option to select the actor for each role. Asan example if we want to see Dasavaratham with Rajini acting, it may be possible. Sridevi could be replaced for shreeya in Sivappu Rojakkal. All the 'Kar silaikal' are one dimensional cinema. Now we are enjoying two diemensional, as it is moving. We may have three dimension cinema as explained in future with various options.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Now we are wondering of 'Kar silaikal' at Mahabalipuram and temples. The software Sivakamai Sabaptham developed by kalki help us to enjoy the great actor Sivakami in the Karsilaikal and the director his father who created them.Similarly our grand grand grand children would enjoy our two diminsional cinema by using appropriate software. Though there may technolgical improvement there may reduction of human values. Compared to earlier generationshuman values were reduced to a lowest level. Joint family is very rare nowa days. In future it may furter liqudiate or go down family concept may go. Â Our Subramaniapuram will tellÂ  the future generation the human values and affection existing at our time.YoursDr L KailasamÂ <br />  --- On Tue, 1/9/09, sps10142004 <sps10142004@ ...  wrote:</p>

<p>    Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>    You are clearly getting confused with this topic.</p>
<p>    Let me start of with the basics,</p>
<p>    Karthigesu Sivathambi in his work"literary history of Tamil Literature"details the two modes of history through Literature.</p>
<p>    Literary History and History of Literature.</p>
<p>    Literary History:</p>
<p>    To study the literature to understand the people who have written the literature , their social status, their economic status, their pass times etc. Tamils 1800 years ago,Study in Tamil by Raghava Iyengar.</p>
<p>    All of Sangam Tamilians history is Literary History.</p>
<p>    Say lets take eg. lets take the Movie Subramaniya Puram. Suppose after some 500 years they see this movie.</p>
<p>    They would make observations like in 1980s they used to was pant and shirt , women used to were Sari. Around Madurai region there was lot of violence. Heaving beard was a style.Rajnikanth was a very popular actor.</p>
<p>    History of Literature:</p>
<p>    To study the history of the literature itself rather than the content of it. Books like Tamil Literature by Venugopala Pillai, History of Tamil Literature by Kamil Zvelebil,History of Tamil Literature by Jesudasan.</p>
<p>    This approach is like when people watch Subramaniyapuram 500 years later, they would observe(if they didnt know when the movie released)</p>
<p>    The movie must not have been taken in 1980s since</p>
<p>    The photography standards have improved</p>
<p>    It has heavy influence of Spanish cinema which is very late development</p>
<p>    The actor Sasi Kumar can also be found nearly in the same get up in film Nadodigal which is closely dates around 2010.</p>
<p>    The same can be said of other cast because all of them seem to be of the period around 2010.</p>
<p>    This film should have been released before the movie Pasanga,Mothi Vilayadu,Saroja because all these movie have mentioned Suramaniyapuram.</p>
<p>    SO Lower limit of the films age is around 2009 .</p>
<p>    The movie also seems to have been a realistic movie.This wave was supposedly started by a movie Kadhal. So the upper limit can be kept as 2005.</p>
<p>    So the movie should have been released in some where between 2007-2008.</p>
<p>    ----</p>
<p>    These are the available methods of study for Reader of History in literature. So it is not important for the history scholar to analyse the filming technique ( though he would touch on it to say - as an evidence) or production values or acting skills of the film.</p>
<p>    Reader of History can only do this much.</p>
<p>    If you want whole analysis of the film,then only a film critic can do it , or if you want to know the religious aspects of the film only religiousexpert can do it.</p>
<p>    History expert when taking a subject can write based only upon proven evidences or related to History in the above mentioned approaches. </p>
<p>    ---</p>
<p>    If your reader of literature or a Linguist you can give critical analysis on a subject. This is different from commentary.A critical analysis of Thirumanthiram would have what diseases are being discussed - comparison of the remedy with the present day remedies- all these.</p>

<p>    Dr.Zvelebil' s Tamil Literature- the one under discussion for the Alwarcontent is work of History on Tamil Literature.</p>
<p>    Smile of Murugan is work of linguist in trying to popularize a languagecalled Tamil to the world.</p>
<p>    His Murugan works:</p>
<p>    Tamil Traditions of Subrahmanya Murga -</p>
<p>    Chronicles all the legends and myths in first part and gives critical analysis on the sources.</p>
<p>    Thiru Murugan - </p>
<p>    Is set of 5 essays - it doesn't belong to any particular genre </p>
<p>    Because some essays are critical analysis,some are papers on Philosophy.</p>
<p>    Tamil Kandha Puranam - Short summary (in english) and critical Analysis.</p>
<p>    ---</p>
<p>    Now regarding Alwar- dating, his work is as a Historian. (Please see the Subramaniyapuram example of History of Literature). This work of his is unparallel and still today considered the reference for nearly all papers written on Tamil. </p>
<p>    So as a historian person would only look for history.As a Linguist and reader of literature would only look in finer aspects of the language.</p>
<p>    So to read Zvelebil and expect the philosophical depth or any thing other than History or as a reader of Literature would end up in a bad way. This failure is not contributed by the Author.</p>

<p>      Hello Vairam</p>
<p>      Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram etc).</p>
<p>      Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??). </p>
<p>      If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes senseon the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>      If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historicalreferences ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version control problem irukke?</p>
<p>      Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with... according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>      Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record toprove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>      Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this research anyway.</p>
<p>      Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with nosurvivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the storycome by?</p>
<p>      I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make sense.</p>
<p>      As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search ofMurugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where heis or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a short cut:-). </p>
<p>      Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was, now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.</p>
<p>      Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then sayThetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>        Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>        you seemed to have hijacked the topic.</p>
<p>        My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.</p>
<p>        It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>        Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or history.</p>
<p>        But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>        I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had year ago!</p>
<p>        I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.</p>
<p>        Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted. </p>
<p>        Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be heldagainst various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>        Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering thelabyrinth again.</p>

<p>          Dear Vairam</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count. </p>
<p>          However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it? </p>
<p>          I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong! </p>
<p>             He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature thanthe literature itself. </p>
<p>          For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga isnever complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>          As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>          I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while GuruArunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>          Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference Ð¦ the usage of that term, on how a person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>          I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spotsuch as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is also difficult to prove Ð•it was not there. </p>
<p>          Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southernvindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed beforetoo.</p>
<p>          I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ð¦ his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>          When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible. </p>
<p>          Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<p>             Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p>
<p>          Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ð¦ purely due to his dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare totread.</p>
<p>          However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevant in all comparisons. </p>
<p>          Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read theseliterature Ð¦ just as literature and not as an embodied sweat ofbhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>          However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.</p>
<p>          These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,though many do not agree.</p>
<p>          PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514; </p>

<p>            Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>            Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating. He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>              Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. </p>
<p>            I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has left in thesepages.</p>
<p>              I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts. </p>
<p>              It is anything but natural that these researches would have abase line that starts with a western ideology.</p>
<p>            Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literaturethan the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my knowledge whohas done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great work - The Eight Anthologies) . </p>
<p>            He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived to a1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>            So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons fromyou , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear yourviews on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>                Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Member<br />        Mistaking history with myth and with factscannot be explained more clearly than this, I think. Simple and clear explanation. Appreciations.<br />  Anbudan<br />  Vishwak<br />    <br />  Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just fyi I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).<br />=======================================  <br />  Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysicallythe soul wedded to its five senses. <br />-----------------</p></blockquote>
<p>VISWAKSENAN SIR.... WELL SAID..</p>
<p>MALATHI HAS EXPLAINED VERY WELL.</p>
<p>Like Draupthy - there is Physical (sthula) Interpretation for the great epics / puranas.. on one side. there is also SOOKSHMA (abstract) interpretation for the same..</p>
<p>Like soul wedding five senses.</p>
<p>Sita Jeevathama. Rama paramathma... Jeeva moving away and unifying again... </p>
<p>Dakshayini Jeevathma... Siva Paramathma .. Effect of Maya etc., etc.</p>

<p>What is my imagination is that an actor could be seen as equal to a man/ woman in a TV cube. There may be option to select the actor for each role. Asan example if we want to see Dasavaratham with Rajini acting, it may be possible. Sridevi could be replaced for shreeya in Sivappu Rojakkal. All the 'Kar silaikal' are one dimensional cinema. Now we are enjoying two diemensional, as it is moving. We may have three dimension cinema as explained in future with various options.</p>
<blockquote><p>  Now we are wondering of 'Kar silaikal' at Mahabalipuram and temples. The software Sivakamai Sabaptham developed by kalki help us to enjoy the great actor Sivakami in the Karsilaikal and the director his father who created them.Similarly our grand grand grand children would enjoy our two diminsional cinema by using appropriate software. Though there may technolgical improvement there may reduction of human values. Compared to earlier generationshuman values were reduced to a lowest level. Joint family is very rare nowa days. In future it may furter liqudiate or go down family concept may go.  Our Subramaniapuram will tell  the future generation the humanvalues and affection existing at our time.YoursDr L Kailasam <br />  --- On Tue, 1/9/09, sps10142004 <sps10142004@...  wrote:</p>

<p>    Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>    You are clearly getting confused with this topic.</p>
<p>    Let me start of with the basics,</p>
<p>    Karthigesu Sivathambi in his work"literary history of Tamil Literature"details the two modes of history through Literature.</p>
<p>    Literary History and History of Literature.</p>
<p>    Literary History:</p>
<p>    To study the literature to understand the people who have written the literature , their social status, their economic status, their pass times etc. Tamils 1800 years ago,Study in Tamil by Raghava Iyengar.</p>
<p>    All of Sangam Tamilians history is Literary History.</p>
<p>    Say lets take eg. lets take the Movie Subramaniya Puram. Suppose after some 500 years they see this movie.</p>
<p>    They would make observations like in 1980s they used to was pant and shirt , women used to were Sari. Around Madurai region there was lot of violence. Heaving beard was a style.Rajnikanth was a very popular actor.</p>
<p>    History of Literature:</p>
<p>    To study the history of the literature itself rather than the content of it. Books like Tamil Literature by Venugopala Pillai, History of Tamil Literature by Kamil Zvelebil,History of Tamil Literature by Jesudasan.</p>
<p>    This approach is like when people watch Subramaniyapuram 500 years later, they would observe(if they didnt know when the movie released)</p>
<p>    The movie must not have been taken in 1980s since</p>
<p>    The photography standards have improved</p>
<p>    It has heavy influence of Spanish cinema which is very late development</p>
<p>    The actor Sasi Kumar can also be found nearly in the same get up in film Nadodigal which is closely dates around 2010.</p>
<p>    The same can be said of other cast because all of them seem to be of the period around 2010.</p>
<p>    This film should have been released before the movie Pasanga,Mothi Vilayadu,Saroja because all these movie have mentioned Suramaniyapuram.</p>
<p>    SO Lower limit of the films age is around 2009 .</p>
<p>    The movie also seems to have been a realistic movie.This wave was supposedly started by a movie Kadhal. So the upper limit can be kept as 2005.</p>
<p>    So the movie should have been released in some where between 2007-2008.</p>
<p>    ----</p>
<p>    These are the available methods of study for Reader of History in literature. So it is not important for the history scholar to analyse the filming technique ( though he would touch on it to say - as an evidence) or production values or acting skills of the film.</p>
<p>    Reader of History can only do this much.</p>
<p>    If you want whole analysis of the film,then only a film critic can do it , or if you want to know the religious aspects of the film only religious expert can do it.</p>
<p>    History expert when taking a subject can write based only upon proven evidences or related to History in the above mentioned approaches. </p>
<p>    ---</p>
<p>    If your reader of literature or a Linguist you can give critical analysis on a subject. This is different from commentary.A critical analysis of Thirumanthiram would have what diseases are being discussed - comparison of the remedy with the present day remedies- all these.</p>
<p>    ---</p>
<p>    Dr.Zvelebil' s Tamil Literature- the one under discussion for the Alwarcontent is work of History on Tamil Literature.</p>
<p>    Smile of Murugan is work of linguist in trying to popularize a languagecalled Tamil to the world.</p>
<p>    His Murugan works:</p>
<p>    Tamil Traditions of Subrahmanya Murga -</p>
<p>    Chronicles all the legends and myths in first part and gives critical analysis on the sources.</p>
<p>    Thiru Murugan - </p>
<p>    Is set of 5 essays - it doesn't belong to any particular genre </p>
<p>    Because some essays are critical analysis,some are papers on Philosophy.</p>
<p>    Tamil Kandha Puranam - Short summary (in english) and critical Analysis.</p>
<p>    ---</p>
<p>    Now regarding Alwar- dating, his work is as a Historian. (Please see the Subramaniyapuram example of History of Literature). This work of his is unparallel and still today considered the reference for nearly all papers written on Tamil. </p>
<p>    So as a historian person would only look for history.As a Linguist and reader of literature would only look in finer aspects of the language.</p>
<p>    So to read Zvelebil and expect the philosophical depth or any thing other than History or as a reader of Literature would end up in a bad way. This failure is not contributed by the Author.</p>

<p>      Hello Vairam</p>
<p>      Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram etc).</p>
<p>      Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??). </p>
<p>      If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes senseon the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>      If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historicalreferences ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version control problem irukke?</p>
<p>      Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with... according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>      Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record toprove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>      Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this research anyway.</p>
<p>      Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with nosurvivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the storycome by?</p>
<p>      I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make sense.</p>
<p>      As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search ofMurugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where heis or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a short cut:-). </p>
<p>      Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was, now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.</p>
<p>      Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then sayThetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>        Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>        you seemed to have hijacked the topic.</p>
<p>        My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.</p>
<p>        It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>        Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or history.</p>
<p>        But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>        I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had year ago!</p>
<p>        I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.</p>
<p>        Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted. </p>
<p>        Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be heldagainst various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>        Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering thelabyrinth again.</p>

<p>          Dear Vairam</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count. </p>
<p>          However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it? </p>
<p>          I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong! </p>
<p>             He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature thanthe literature itself. </p>
<p>          For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga isnever complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>          As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>          I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while GuruArunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>          Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference Ц the usage of that term, on how a person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about thisearlier too.</p>
<p>          I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spotsuch as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is also difficult to prove Еit was not there. </p>
<p>          Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southernvindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed beforetoo.</p>
<p>          I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ц his timeline of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>          When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible. </p>
<p>          Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<p>             Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p>
<p>          Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ц purely due to his dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to tread.</p>
<p>          However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevant in all comparisons. </p>
<p>          Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read theseliterature Ц just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>          However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.</p>
<p>          These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,though many do not agree.</p>
<p>          PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514; </p>

<p>            Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>            Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating. He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>              Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. </p>
<p>            I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has left in thesepages.</p>
<p>              I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts. </p>
<p>              It is anything but natural that these researches would have abase line that starts with a western ideology.</p>
<p>            Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literaturethan the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my knowledge whohas done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great work - The Eight Anthologies) . </p>
<p>            He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived to a1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>            So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons fromyou , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear yourviews on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>                Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

        <p>Dear Member<br />      Mistaking history with myth and with facts cannot be explained more clearly than this, I think. Simple and clear explanation. Appreciations.<br />Anbudan<br />Vishwak</p>

<p>  <br />Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka ishistory (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysically the soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor for spiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi' , Draupadi was attracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>  History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />  history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />  in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />  several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />  of Gandhi etc.)</p>
<p>  It is preferable not to get swayed or bulldozed by the 'scientific' tag<br />  attached to extrapolated and biased versions of 'history'.</p>

<p>    Hello Vairam</p>
<p>    Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />  the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />  etc).</p>
<p>    Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />    If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />  on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />  Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>    If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />  references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />  control problem irukke?</p>
<p>    Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />  according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />  case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>    Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />  patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />  proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record<br />  to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />  current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />  bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>    Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />  research anyway.</p>
<p>    Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />  survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />  story come by?</p>
<p>    I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />  all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />  sense.</p>
<p>    As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search of<br />  Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />  he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />  short cut :-).</p>
<p>    Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />  now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />  Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />    Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />  Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />  say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />  scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>      you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />      My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />  said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />      It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>      Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />  history.</p>
<p>      But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />  know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>      I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />  had year ago!</p>
<p>      I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />  believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />      Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />  what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />      Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />  against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />  other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />  finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />  welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>      Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />  labyrinth again.</p>

<p>        Dear Vairam</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />  and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />  have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>        However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />  anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />  line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />  similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>        I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />  Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />        Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />  Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />  study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>           He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />  the literature itself.</p>
<p>        For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />  and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />  foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />  not be so.</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />  entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />  Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />  Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>        As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />  adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>        I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />  noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />  Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />  poet.</p>
<p>        Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />  itself makes a mile of difference Ц the usage of that term, on how a<br />  person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />  literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />  written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>        I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />  location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />  thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />  spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />  there, it is also difficult to prove Еit was not there.<br />        Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />  as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />  with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />  southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />  Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />  believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />  question posed before too.</p>
<p>        I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />  avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ц<br />  his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />  there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>        When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />  it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />  the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />  possible.</p>
<p>        Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />  this research?</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />  enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />  experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />  entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>           Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />  are.</p>
<p>        Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />  to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ц purely due to his<br />  dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />  tread.</p>
<p>        However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />  relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>        Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />  literature Ц just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />  bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />  these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />  awe.</p>
<p>        However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />  even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />        These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />  though many do not agree.</p>

<p>          Hi Ravi,<br />          Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />  in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />  various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />  He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>            Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />  research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />          I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />  of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />  Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />  members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />  left in these pages.</p>
<p>            I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />  cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />            It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />  base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />          Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />  been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />  Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />  knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />  work - The Eight Anthologies) .<br />          He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />  claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />  his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />  nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />  Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />  out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />  biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />  <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>          So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />  you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />  your views on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>            History does not account for various stories and tales of the<br />  bard, which seems to be having many lines of history before being sung.</p>

<p>              Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's<br />  Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating<br />  of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for<br />  dating of various literature.</p>

        <p>Every religion has a theory of evolution of man and universe, Old Testamentdescribes about God’s creation of earth in six days, Srimad Bhagavatam defines elaborately the churning of the ocean of milk from which almost everything came about to live. How much of these stories of creationare true?   Do they sound credible to all segments of society, for all the time even after man has walked on the moon and mankind seems to have achieved a giant science and technological leap? <br /> <br />The answer is a resounding yes. Some conservative states in the US have voted in favor of removing Darwin’s evolution theory from their schoolcurriculum as it conflicts with Bible. Science may say Big bang is correctbut for some the world is a creation of omniscient God; the debate is still continuing.<br /> <br />God’s creation story could be an embodiment of truth, but how wouldanyone who believes that to be true is correct when they were not alive atthe time of world’s creation?  Was there really a ‘ksheer sagar’ or ‘Paal kadal’? Was there a thousand headed venom spewing snake Vasuki? Did Lord Shiva really drink killer toxin ‘halahal’ to save mankind?  These stories are best suited to be dubbed as lies, but are they?<br /> <br />It appears that those who created these stories are the one who reasoned out from what they observed and understood of the world’s origin.  They created allegorical stories that would explain what they knew.  Myths are in fact truthful narrations and figurative explanations when not taken literally but allegorically. We see there is some history but not entirely everything is verifiable or stand for validation.  Thus the common dealing of myth in synonymy with lies is entirely wrong. <br /> <br />May be the theory of Big bang is explained with limited scientific knowledge our ancestors had in mythological stories. Man’s constant quest to find answers to complex and nebulous questions of metaphysical dimensions, origins and nature of cosmos were shaped as myths. They are antediluvian and pre-scientific attempt to clarify nature and its genesis.  <br /> <br />It could very well be possible that our future generation in another five thousand years will view well researched, scientific theories of our times as myths.<br /> <br />Best regards,<br /> <br />TMS</p>

<p>  <br />Dear Satish, I love 'bee movie' :)) Just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  the misconception again over the word 'mere myth' - the idea that myths are lies evolved again much later- the dictionary definition of the word 'symbolic narrative'. By forcing asymbolic narative to be a 'real world' the value of the symbolism is lost and real world narrative gets confused. </p>
<p>Just a very mundane example - the tortoise is a slow moving creature. This is a proven fact, the tortoise moves slowly due to the heavy weight of its shell. There are numerous stories evolved around this as around other animals - like the famous one of the race between the hare and the tortoise where the tortoise wins to prove the point that slow and steady wins the race. There was no race between a hare and a tortooise and really the speed at which the tortoise moves means nothing to the scientific world other than that it has a heavy shell. But the allegorical story signifies the virtues of patience. If this story was part of some purana the way we argue is trying to prove that story like some centuries ago hare and tortoise did compete, the tortoise is some spirit/deva that has patience and so on. How ridiculous does that sound?</p>
<p>The point about a myth is not at all about whether it was 'true' or 'factual' it is about what it signifies, unfortunately the obsession with making it real often times overrules the desire to even understand what the story signifies.</p>

<p>  Vairam - your post was excellent. But what if only prints of<br />  subramaniyapuram is available after 500 years and no print of other movies<br />  you specified are available, what will be the research output? definitelya<br />  wrong conclusion. So is our current history knowledge.</p>
<p>  One of the best philosophical movie I have seen is the 'BEE MOVIE'. Pixar<br />  needs no introduction for their story boards. Cars and Bee Movie are my<br />  favourite as it has very good philosophy. Especially Bee Movie...I think the<br />  story is inspired by Gita. The message - do your duty without looking at<br />  other aspects and the world will be real good.</p>
<p>  The movie starts with the caption, even before the title - "AS PER THE KNOWN<br />  LAWS OF AERODYNAMICS, BEE CANNOT FLY, BECAUSE THE BODY OF THE BEE WITH ITS<br />  SMALL WINGS AND LARGE BODY IS NOT SUITABLE FOR FLYING.</p>
<p>  BUT STILL BEE'S FLY.....BECAUSE BEE'S DO NOT BOTHER ABOUT WHAT HUMANS THINK"</p>
<p>  what a great philosophy.. .reflecting avvai's katrathy kai man alavu.</p>
<p>  and we fight over petty things in the name of history and myth... :)</p>

        <p>Dear,Very interesting mail. After 500 years, two dimensional cinema may be improved to  three dimensional cinema . What is my imagination is thatan actor could be seen as equal to a man/ woman in a TV cube. There may beoption to select the actor for each role. As an example if we want to see Dasavaratham with Rajini acting, it may be possible. Sridevi could be replaced for shreeya in Sivappu Rojakkal. All the 'Kar silaikal' are one dimensional cinema. Now we are enjoying two diemensional, as it is moving. We may have three dimension cinema as explained in future with various options.<br />Now we are wondering of 'Kar silaikal' at Mahabalipuram and temples. The software Sivakamai Sabaptham developed by kalki help us to enjoy the great actor Sivakami in the Karsilaikal and the director his father who created them.Similarly our grand grand grand children would enjoy our two diminsional cinema by using appropriate software. Though there may technolgical improvement there may reduction of human values. Compared to earlier generations human values were reduced to a lowest level. Joint family is very rare now adays. In future it may furter liqudiate or go down family concept may go.  Our Subramaniapuram will tell  the future generation the human values and affection existing at our time.YoursDr L Kailasam <br />--- On Tue, 1/9/09, sps10142004 <sps10142004@yahoo.co.in  wrote:</p>

<p>  Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>  You are clearly getting confused with this topic.</p>
<p>  Let me start of with the basics,</p>
<p>  Karthigesu Sivathambi in his work"literary history of Tamil Literature" details the two modes of history through Literature.</p>
<p>  Literary History and History of Literature.</p>
<p>  Literary History:</p>
<p>  To study the literature to understand the people who have written the literature , their social status, their economic status, their pass times etc.Tamils 1800 years ago,Study in Tamil by Raghava Iyengar.</p>
<p>  All of Sangam Tamilians history is Literary History.</p>
<p>  Say lets take eg. lets take the Movie Subramaniya Puram. Suppose after some 500 years they see this movie.</p>
<p>  They would make observations like in 1980s they used to was pant and shirt , women used to were Sari. Around Madurai region there was lot of violence. Heaving beard was a style.Rajnikanth was a very popular actor.</p>
<p>  History of Literature:</p>
<p>  To study the history of the literature itself rather than the content of it. Books like Tamil Literature by Venugopala Pillai, History of Tamil Literature by Kamil Zvelebil,History of Tamil Literature by Jesudasan.</p>
<p>  This approach is like when people watch Subramaniyapuram 500 years later,they would observe(if they didnt know when the movie released)</p>
<p>  The movie must not have been taken in 1980s since</p>
<p>  The photography standards have improved</p>
<p>  It has heavy influence of Spanish cinema which is very late development</p>
<p>  The actor Sasi Kumar can also be found nearly in the same get up in film Nadodigal which is closely dates around 2010.</p>
<p>  The same can be said of other cast because all of them seem to be of the period around 2010.</p>
<p>  This film should have been released before the movie Pasanga,Mothi Vilayadu,Saroja because all these movie have mentioned Suramaniyapuram.</p>
<p>  SO Lower limit of the films age is around 2009 .</p>
<p>  The movie also seems to have been a realistic movie.This wave was supposedly started by a movie Kadhal. So the upper limit can be kept as 2005.</p>
<p>  So the movie should have been released in some where between 2007-2008.</p>
<p>  ----</p>
<p>  These are the available methods of study for Reader of History in literature. So it is not important for the history scholar to analyse the filming technique ( though he would touch on it to say - as an evidence) or production values or acting skills of the film.</p>
<p>  Reader of History can only do this much.</p>
<p>  If you want whole analysis of the film,then only a film critic can do it , or if you want to know the religious aspects of the film only religious expert can do it.</p>
<p>  History expert when taking a subject can write based only upon proven evidences or related to History in the above mentioned approaches. </p>
<p>  ---</p>
<p>  If your reader of literature or a Linguist you can give critical analysison a subject. This is different from commentary.A critical analysis of Thirumanthiram would have what diseases are being discussed - comparison of the remedy with the present day remedies- all these.</p>
<p>  ---</p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil' s Tamil Literature- the one under discussion for the Alwar content is work of History on Tamil Literature.</p>
<p>  Smile of Murugan is work of linguist in trying to popularize a language called Tamil to the world.</p>
<p>  His Murugan works:</p>
<p>  Tamil Traditions of Subrahmanya Murga -</p>
<p>  Chronicles all the legends and myths in first part and gives critical analysis on the sources.</p>
<p>  Thiru Murugan - </p>
<p>  Is set of 5 essays - it doesn't belong to any particular genre </p>
<p>  Because some essays are critical analysis,some are papers on Philosophy.</p>
<p>  Tamil Kandha Puranam - Short summary (in english) and critical Analysis.</p>
<p>  ---</p>
<p>  Now regarding Alwar- dating, his work is as a Historian. (Please see the Subramaniyapuram example of History of Literature). This work of his is unparallel and still today considered the reference for nearly all papers written on Tamil. </p>
<p>  So as a historian person would only look for history.As a Linguist and reader of literature would only look in finer aspects of the language.</p>
<p>  So to read Zvelebil and expect the philosophical depth or any thing otherthan History or as a reader of Literature would end up in a bad way. This failure is not contributed by the Author.</p>

<p>    Hello Vairam</p>
<p>    Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram etc).</p>
<p>    Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??). </p>
<p>    If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>    If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version control problem irukke?</p>
<p>    Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with... according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this case,historyhas no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>    Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be proper in its explanations. And historians must have a convincing record to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a bard's tale andcannot be real.</p>
<p>    Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this research anyway.</p>
<p>    Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the story come by?</p>
<p>    I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make sense.</p>
<p>    As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil( rest his soul), I am in search of Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a short cut :-). </p>
<p>    Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was, now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.</p>
<p>    Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>      Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>      you seemed to have hijacked the topic.</p>
<p>      My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.</p>
<p>      It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>      Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or history.</p>
<p>      But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>      I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had year ago!</p>
<p>      I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.</p>
<p>      Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted. </p>
<p>      Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to welcome it. Archeology,numismat ic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>      Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the labyrinth again.</p>

<p>        Dear Vairam</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west andstudied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count. </p>
<p>        However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it? </p>
<p>        I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of TrojanWar (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong! </p>
<p>           He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. </p>
<p>        For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature andhistory of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>        As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>        I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>        Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference Ц the usage of that term, on how a personapproaches a specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>        I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is also difficult to prove Еit was not there. </p>
<p>        Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed before too.</p>
<p>        I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age Ц his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>        When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it)was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible. </p>
<p>        Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<p>           Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p>
<p>        Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed Ц purely due to his dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to tread.</p>
<p>        However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevant in all comparisons. </p>
<p>        Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these literature Ц just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>        However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic, even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.</p>
<p>        These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions, though many do not agree.</p>
<p>        PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514; </p>

<p>          Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>          Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data inhis book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by variousscholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating. He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>            Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. </p>
<p>          I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161 of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all members ofthe group if you can let us know the important gaps he has left in these pages.</p>
<p>            I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and culturalonset prior to researching dravidian scripts. </p>
<p>            It is anything but natural that these researches would have a base line that starts with a western ideology.</p>
<p>          Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never beencontroversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great work - The Eight Anthologies) . </p>
<p>          He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived to an 990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog <a href="http://muelangovan" title="http://muelangovan">http://muelangovan</a>. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/17-11- 1927.html</p>
<p>          So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear your views on Dr.Zvelebil' s works.</p>

<p>              Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi People,</p>
<p>Surely there is great mis understanding going on here.</p>
<p>Myth or History debate has taken place so much without knowing the origins of the debate.</p>
<p>---<br />When I said Myth vs History - I was trying to point out this</p>
<p>Lets say some 3000 years ago. There were people living in North India and people in South India.<br />Vindhyas in between were great barrier ,only few people who really wanted to travel south(traders- saints) crossed borders.</p>
<p>The gods and beliefs of these two grps of people are localized. </p>
<p>Say in North<br />X was god of love<br />Y was god of victory<br />Z was god of fertility</p>
<p>In South<br />A was god of love<br />B was god of victory<br />C was god of fertility</p>
<p>Then as time progressed Vindhyas were conquered and can be safely said during the time of Ashoka - mass migrations started taking place.</p>
<p>Slowly people started to realize X and A(similarly other combinations) had lot of similar qualities. Slowly and steadily people from North and south had intermingled and mixed.So instead of having two gods having nearly same qualities. They started identifying X as A and A as X interchangeably( eg. All ur Kulatheivam usually called Ayyanar and female deity being addressed Ammans).</p>
<p>Then slowly there was a period where after identifying X as A (vice versa) there was period of relating X and Y and Z (alternatively ABC or ZAB ..and other combinations).</p>
<p>Now XYZ became a family. In the same time Temple structures were being built and Sthala Puranas were written and other purnas were written.<br />Each Temple wrote their own purana giving some importance to their own place. How God localized there, what he or she did there. The legends and beliefs of the Local deity was incorporated and the God was identified with the Major GOD(Eg. Sunderaswarar - Meenakshi - though they have local names for Madurai- they are identified as SHiva and parvathi- we also know this legend is peculiar to Madurai and attested by Megasthanese).</p>
<p>The purana writing spree continued till 19th century( People who have read UV Swaminatha Iyer's En Sarithiram would know- how his guru was invited to temples to write purnas about the temple).</p>
<p>So at some point of time we get a standardized Myth<br />like A is husband of B their kid is C. A did this , C did this and so on. Lets keep the myth name some Q purana.( Like many versions of Ramayana - finally the standardized version we have - we just remove lot of details to make it more like story to teach our kids on Morals)</p>
<p>-----<br />Now my point</p>
<p>Q purana before taking Shape must have had other forms.Best of all these forms were compiled into Q purana.</p>
<p>What I mean by History is</p>
<blockquote><p>  To research each available previous form of Q purana.<br />  Compare the differences.<br />  Also date these different versions<br />  IF difference occurs see the political and socio economic situation of the period based on other studies.<br />( Why Ravana Takes Sita out of ground instead of grabbing her hair in KambaRamayana - In Tamil land it was considered an insult to carry a woman by her hair)<br />  Question each of the difference in each version of the purana and try to analyse why this has happened.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you go in this way then you might find out in one literature A is described and in another X is described. But in present day X and A are same, butwe get to point where in old days, description of A nearly doesn't match with X - Then we can go onto say X and A were possibly two different gods, But later got Identified as Same.</p>
<p>As SPS pointed out<br />Nearly all gods in present had a nearly a diff description in Pre Sangam Age.</p>
<p>Alamara Selvar -- Rudra(Shiva)<br />Kottravai - Parvathi(Durga)<br />Maal - Krishna( vishnu)<br />Seyyon (Murukan) - Skanda (Subrahmanya)<br />Ko - Indran</p>
<p>Unfortunately except for Murukan - Skanda - no other gods Literature exists(they exists just enough to show that God was there but noting more than that) in present to show the difference between the northern deity and Southern Diety. By End of Sangam age the process of identifying Kottravai as Durga and Maal as Vishnu had taken place.<br />No pre sangam works have existed (considering we have rock edicts of 250 BCin Tamil and Sangam age was 1-3rd century AD- surely some literatures werewritten in these 200-300 years).</p>
<p>This kind of identifying and forming common myth leads to a popular term with present day historians - the term 'Composite God'.<br />Romila Thapar goes on to say Krishna was a composite god with attributes taken from various legends and myths all around India. The trait of Krishna being a cowherd and being black comes from Tamil God Maal.</p>
<p>The Sangam Age description of Murugan and Skanda description in Sanskrit literature have huge differences (surely they have some similarities). This is attested nearly by every scholar ( Indian and Western). </p>
<p>---<br />The Myth(Myth vs History) part I mentioned means as below</p>
<p>Taking Q purana or the standardized purana, as an account of History and placing arguments based on it for a history discussion is not a good way in moving forward in a history discussion.</p>
<p>---<br />I surely do not mean a Legend should be dismissed as a myth. I only say that it shouldn't be taken as definitive history. </p>
<p>Ramayana by all means should be considered as a epic or legend and can be studied as an subject of History. But it should not be considered a Historical account of that period.</p>
<p>Ramayana by all probability has lot of historical details.But at the same time one has to surely keep in mind it was written as a Epic/Legend so thereare all possibility imaginary elements in it.</p>
<p>---<br />I said this because of the follwing reasons:</p>
<blockquote><p>  The standardized version of Murugan legend(6 temples and family story)is of very very late orgin-as late 15-16 th century.<br />   14 th century version of Kasiappa Sivachariyar is very close to current legend - but he doesn't mention Palani Legend in his work.<br />   5-6th century we have for first time in Tamil Literature- Muruga being son of Shiva Parvathy in Silapadikaram<br />   Around late 4th century early 5th century we have Thirumurugatru padai which is the first literature to have both Tamil and Sanskrit traditions of Muruga/Skanda.<br />   before this the legends of Muruga in Tamil and Skanda in Sanskrit are vastly different.<br />   to go a step further the legend of Skanda itself were different in different puranas(some have agni as father ,some have rudra as father- also one Skanda has brahmin attributes - in another the warrior attributes).</p></blockquote>
<p>Keeping Standarised version (either Arunagirinathar version or Kasiappa Sivachariyar version) as the basis for the argument in argument on history will lead no where.</p>
<p>I am surley not questioning the great ness of Arunagirnathar's work or Kasiappa Siva chariyar's work. All I am saying is - these works are greatworks in Philosophy and Religion.<br />Taking this as historical source and arguing based on it can't help in any development.</p>
<p>This is what I meant by History vs Myth.(Historical study on subject vs legend as such (not historical study on legend/epic) as basis of an historicaldebate).</p>
<p>I am sure I have confused more people than clarifying. Tired my best - whatto do!</p>
<p>Forgive me fellows!</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Satish, I love 'bee movie' :)) Just fyi the misconception again overthe word 'mere myth' - the idea that myths are lies evolved again much later - the dictionary definition of the word 'symbolic narrative'. By forcinga symbolic narative to be a 'real world' the value of the symbolism is lost and real world narrative gets confused. </p>
<p>  Just a very mundane example - the tortoise is a slow moving creature. This is a proven fact, the tortoise moves slowly due to the heavy weight of its shell. There are numerous stories evolved around this as around other animals - like the famous one of the race between the hare and the tortoise where the tortoise wins to prove the point that slow and steady wins the race. There was no race between a hare and a tortooise and really the speed at which the tortoise moves means nothing to the scientific world other than that it has a heavy shell. But the allegorical story signifies the virtues of patience. If this story was part of some purana the way we argue is trying to prove that story like some centuries ago hare and tortoise did compete, the tortoise is some spirit/deva that has patience and so on. How ridiculous does that sound?</p>
<p>  The point about a myth is not at all about whether it was 'true' or 'factual' it is about what it signifies, unfortunately the obsession with makingit real often times overrules the desire to even understand what the storysignifies.</p>

<p>    hmm...interesting read....<br />    I have not read Dr.Zvelebil and I am not well versed in history. But I<br />    strongly belive (and concur with Ravi and Sampath) that without a fact,<br />    there is no myth (maybe as malathi said...myth has origin in some fact).<br />    Just because we dont have proof or scientific evidence, we tend to brush<br />    them aside as mere myth and not history, which is typically a wester thought<br />    process.</p>
<p>    Vairam - your post was excellent. But what if only prints of<br />    subramaniyapuram is available after 500 years and no print of other movies<br />    you specified are available, what will be the research output? definitely a<br />    wrong conclusion. So is our current history knowledge.</p>
<p>    One of the best philosophical movie I have seen is the 'BEE MOVIE'. Pixar<br />    needs no introduction for their story boards. Cars and Bee Movie are my<br />    favourite as it has very good philosophy. Especially Bee Movie...I think the<br />    story is inspired by Gita. The message - do your duty without looking at<br />    other aspects and the world will be real good.</p>
<p>    The movie starts with the caption, even before the title - "AS PER THE KNOWN<br />    LAWS OF AERODYNAMICS, BEE CANNOT FLY, BECAUSE THE BODY OF THE BEE WITH ITS<br />    SMALL WINGS AND LARGE BODY IS NOT SUITABLE FOR FLYING.</p>
<p>    BUT STILL BEE'S FLY.....BECAUSE BEE'S DO NOT BOTHER ABOUT WHAT HUMANS THINK"</p>
<p>    what a great philosophy...reflecting avvai's katrathy kai man alavu.</p>
<p>    and we fight over petty things in the name of history and myth... :)</p>

        <p>Dear Satish, I love 'bee movie' :)) Just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  the misconception again over the word 'mere myth' - the idea that myths are lies evolved again much later- the dictionary definition of the word 'symbolic narrative'. By forcing asymbolic narative to be a 'real world' the value of the symbolism is lost and real world narrative gets confused. </p>
<p>Just a very mundane example - the tortoise is a slow moving creature. This is a proven fact, the tortoise moves slowly due to the heavy weight of its shell. There are numerous stories evolved around this as around other animals - like the famous one of the race between the hare and the tortoise where the tortoise wins to prove the point that slow and steady wins the race. There was no race between a hare and a tortooise and really the speed at which the tortoise moves means nothing to the scientific world other than that it has a heavy shell. But the allegorical story signifies the virtues of patience. If this story was part of some purana the way we argue is trying to prove that story like some centuries ago hare and tortoise did compete, the tortoise is some spirit/deva that has patience and so on. How ridiculous does that sound?</p>
<p>The point about a myth is not at all about whether it was 'true' or 'factual' it is about what it signifies, unfortunately the obsession with making it real often times overrules the desire to even understand what the story signifies.</p>

        <p>WOW. SUCH A NICE MAIL... PUT PAINSTAKINGLY.</p>
<p>thanks dear Vairam...</p>
<p>the postulate is interesting.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>  You are clearly getting confused with this topic.<br />  Let me start of with the basics,</p>
<p>  Karthigesu Sivathambi in his work"literary history of Tamil Literature" details the two modes of history through Literature.</p>
<p>  Literary History and History of Literature.</p>
<p>  Literary History:<br />  To study the literature to understand the people who have written the literature , their social status, their economic status, their pass times etc.Tamils 1800 years ago,Study in Tamil by Raghava Iyengar.<br />  All of Sangam Tamilians history is Literary History.</p>
<p>  Say lets take eg. lets take the Movie Subramaniya Puram. Suppose after some 500 years they see this movie.<br />  They would make observations like in 1980s they used to was pant and shirt , women used to were Sari. Around Madurai region there was lot of violence. Heaving beard was a style.Rajnikanth was a very popular actor.</p>
<p>  History of Literature:<br />  To study the history of the literature itself rather than the content of it. Books like Tamil Literature by Venugopala Pillai, History of Tamil Literature by Kamil Zvelebil,History of Tamil Literature by Jesudasan.</p>
<p>  This approach is like when people watch Subramaniyapuram 500 years later,they would observe(if they didnt know when the movie released)<br />  The movie must not have been taken in 1980s since<br />  The photography standards have improved<br />  It has heavy influence of Spanish cinema which is very late development<br />  The actor Sasi Kumar can also be found nearly in the same get up in film Nadodigal which is closely dates around 2010.<br />  The same can be said of other cast because all of them seem to be of the period around 2010.<br />  This film should have been released before the movie Pasanga,Mothi Vilayadu,Saroja because all these movie have mentioned Suramaniyapuram.<br />  SO Lower limit of the films age is around 2009 .<br />  The movie also seems to have been a realistic movie.This wave was supposedly started by a movie Kadhal. So the upper limit can be kept as 2005.<br />  So the movie should have been released in some where between 2007-2008.</p>
<p>  ----<br />  These are the available methods of study for Reader of History in literature. So it is not important for the history scholar to analyse the filming technique ( though he would touch on it to say - as an evidence) or production values or acting skills of the film.<br />  Reader of History can only do this much.</p>
<p>  If you want whole analysis of the film,then only a film critic can do it , or if you want to know the religious aspects of the film only religious expert can do it.</p>
<p>  History expert when taking a subject can write based only upon proven evidences or related to History in the above mentioned approaches. </p>
<p>  ---<br />  If your reader of literature or a Linguist you can give critical analysison a subject. This is different from commentary.A critical analysis of Thirumanthiram would have what diseases are being discussed - comparison of the remedy with the present day remedies- all these.<br />  ---</p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil's Tamil Literature- the one under discussion for the Alwar content is work of History on Tamil Literature.</p>
<p>  Smile of Murugan is work of linguist in trying to popularize a language called Tamil to the world.</p>
<p>  His Murugan works:<br />  Tamil Traditions of Subrahmanya Murga -<br />  Chronicles all the legends and myths in first part and gives critical analysis on the sources.<br />  Thiru Murugan - <br />  Is set of 5 essays - it doesn't belong to any particular genre <br />  Because some essays are critical analysis,some are papers on Philosophy.<br />  Tamil Kandha Puranam - Short summary (in english) and critical Analysis.</p>
<p>  ---</p>
<p>  Now regarding Alwar- dating, his work is as a Historian. (Please see the Subramaniyapuram example of History of Literature). This work of his is unparallel and still today considered the reference for nearly all papers written on Tamil. </p>
<p>  So as a historian person would only look for history.As a Linguist and reader of literature would only look in finer aspects of the language.</p>
<p>  So to read Zvelebil and expect the philosophical depth or any thing otherthan History or as a reader of Literature would end up in a bad way. This failure is not contributed by the Author.</p>

<p>    Hello Vairam</p>
<p>    Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram etc).</p>
<p>    Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??). <br />    If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>    If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version control problem irukke?</p>
<p>    Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with... according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this case,historyhas no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>    Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be proper in its explanations.And historians must have a convincing record to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our current humanmind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>    Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this research anyway.</p>
<p>    Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the story come by?</p>
<p>    I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make sense.</p>
<p>    As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil(rest his soul), I am in search of Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where he isor what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a short cut :-). </p>
<p>    Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was, now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />    Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>      Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>      you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />      My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />      It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>      Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or history.</p>
<p>      But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>      I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had year ago!</p>
<p>      I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />      Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted. <br />      Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to welcome it. Archeology,numismatic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>      Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the labyrinth again.</p>

<p>        Dear Vairam</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west andstudied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count. </p>
<p>        However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it? </p>
<p>        I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of TrojanWar (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />        Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong! </p>
<p>           He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. </p>
<p>        For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature andhistory of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>        As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>        I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>        Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference ? the usage of that term, on how a person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>        I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is also difficult to prove ?it was not there. <br />        Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed before too.</p>
<p>        I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age ? his time lineof alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>        When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it)was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible. </p>
<p>        Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<p>           Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p>
<p>        Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed ? purely due to his dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to tread.</p>
<p>        However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevant in all comparisons. </p>
<p>        Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these literature ? just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>        However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic, even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />        These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions, though many do not agree.</p>
<p>        PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514; </p>

<p>          Hi Ravi,<br />          Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data inhis book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by variousscholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating. He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>            Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. <br />          I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161 of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all members ofthe group if you can let us know the important gaps he has left in these pages.</p>
<p>            I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and culturalonset prior to researching dravidian scripts. <br />            It is anything but natural that these researches would have a base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />          Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never beencontroversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great work - The Eight Anthologies). <br />          He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived to an 990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog <a href="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html" title="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html">http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html</a></p>
<p>          So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear your views on Dr.Zvelebil's works.</p>

<p>              Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

<p>Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka is history (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysically the soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor for spiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi', Draupadi was attracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>  History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />  history is proved false, it again becomes a myth.

<p>    Hello Vairam</p>
<p>    Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />  the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />  etc).</p>
<p>    Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />    If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />  on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />  Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>    If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />  references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />  control problem irukke?</p>
<p>    Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />  according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />  case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>    Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />  patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />  proper in its explanations.And historians must have a convincing record<br />  to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />  current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />  bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>    Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />  research anyway.</p>
<p>    Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />  survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />  story come by?</p>
<p>    I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />  all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />  sense.</p>
<p>    As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil(rest his soul), I am in search of<br />  Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />  he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />  short cut :-).</p>
<p>    Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />  now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />  Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />    Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />  Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />  say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />  scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>      you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />      My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />  said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />      It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>      Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />  history.</p>
<p>      But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />  know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>      I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />  had year ago!</p>
<p>      I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />  believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />      Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />  what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />      Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />  against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />  other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />  finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />  welcome it. Archeology,numismatic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>      Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />  labyrinth again.</p>

<p>        Dear Vairam</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />  and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />  have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>        However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />  anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />  line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />  similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>        I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />  Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />        Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />  Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />  study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>           He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />  the literature itself.</p>
<p>        For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />  and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />  foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />  not be so.</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />  entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />  Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />  Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>        As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />  adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>        I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />  noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />  Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />  poet.</p>
<p>        Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />  itself makes a mile of difference – the usage of that term, on how a<br />  person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />  literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />  written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>        I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />  location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />  thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />  spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />  there, it is also difficult to prove …it was not there.<br />        Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />  as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />  with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />  southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />  Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />  believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />  question posed before too.</p>
<p>        I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />  avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age –<br />  his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />  there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>        When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />  it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />  the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />  possible.</p>
<p>        Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />  this research?</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />  enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />  experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />  entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>           Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />  are.</p>
<p>        Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />  to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed – purely due to his<br />  dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />  tread.</p>
<p>        However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />  relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>        Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />  literature – just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />  bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />  these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />  awe.</p>
<p>        However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />  even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />        These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />  though many do not agree.</p>
<p>        PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some<br />  argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;</p>

<p>          Hi Ravi,<br />          Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />  in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />  various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />  He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>            Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />  research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />          I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />  of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />  Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />  members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />  left in these pages.</p>
<p>            I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />  cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />            It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />  base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />          Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />  been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />  Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />  knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />  work - The Eight Anthologies).<br />          He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />  claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />  his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />  to an off spring of Sanskrit by scholars like KAN Shastri). From 1952 to<br />  nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />  Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />  out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />  biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />  <a href="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html" title="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html">http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html</a> <http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html  </p>
<p>          So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />  you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />  your views on Dr.Zvelebil's works.</p>

<p>            History does not account for various stories and tales of the<br />  bard, which seems to be having many lines of history before being sung.</p>
<p>            Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />  research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />            I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />  cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />            It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />  base line that starts with a western ideology.</p>

<p>              Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's<br />  Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating<br />  of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for<br />  dating of various literature.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>  You are clearly getting confused with this topic.<br />  Let me start of with the basics,</p>
<p>  Karthigesu Sivathambi in his work"literary history of Tamil Literature"<br />  details the two modes of history through Literature.</p>
<p>  Literary History and History of Literature.</p>
<p>  Literary History:<br />  To study the literature to understand the people who have written the<br />  literature , their social status, their economic status, their pass times<br />  etc. Tamils 1800 years ago,Study in Tamil by Raghava Iyengar.<br />  All of Sangam Tamilians history is Literary History.</p>
<p>  Say lets take eg. lets take the Movie Subramaniya Puram. Suppose after some<br />  500 years they see this movie.<br />  They would make observations like in 1980s they used to was pant and shirt ,<br />  women used to were Sari. Around Madurai region there was lot of violence.<br />  Heaving beard was a style.Rajnikanth was a very popular actor.</p>
<p>  History of Literature:<br />  To study the history of the literature itself rather than the content of it.<br />  Books like Tamil Literature by Venugopala Pillai, History of Tamil<br />  Literature by Kamil Zvelebil,History of Tamil Literature by Jesudasan.</p>
<p>  This approach is like when people watch Subramaniyapuram 500 years later,<br />  they would observe(if they didnt know when the movie released)<br />  The movie must not have been taken in 1980s since<br />  The photography standards have improved<br />  It has heavy influence of Spanish cinema which is very late development<br />  The actor Sasi Kumar can also be found nearly in the same get up in film<br />  Nadodigal which is closely dates around 2010.<br />  The same can be said of other cast because all of them seem to be of the<br />  period around 2010.<br />  This film should have been released before the movie Pasanga,Mothi<br />  Vilayadu,Saroja because all these movie have mentioned Suramaniyapuram.<br />  SO Lower limit of the films age is around 2009 .<br />  The movie also seems to have been a realistic movie.This wave was supposedly<br />  started by a movie Kadhal. So the upper limit can be kept as 2005.<br />  So the movie should have been released in some where between 2007-2008.</p>
<p>  ----<br />  These are the available methods of study for Reader of History in<br />  literature. So it is not important for the history scholar to analyse the<br />  filming technique ( though he would touch on it to say - as an evidence) or<br />  production values or acting skills of the film.<br />  Reader of History can only do this much.</p>
<p>  If you want whole analysis of the film,then only a film critic can do it ,<br />  or if you want to know the religious aspects of the film only religious<br />  expert can do it.</p>
<p>  History expert when taking a subject can write based only upon proven<br />  evidences or related to History in the above mentioned approaches.</p>
<p>  ---<br />  If your reader of literature or a Linguist you can give critical analysison<br />  a subject. This is different from commentary.A critical analysis of<br />  Thirumanthiram would have what diseases are being discussed - comparison of<br />  the remedy with the present day remedies- all these.<br />  ---</p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil's Tamil Literature- the one under discussion for the Alwar<br />  content is work of History on Tamil Literature.</p>
<p>  Smile of Murugan is work of linguist in trying to popularize a language<br />  called Tamil to the world.</p>
<p>  His Murugan works:<br />  Tamil Traditions of Subrahmanya Murga -<br />  Chronicles all the legends and myths in first part and gives critical<br />  analysis on the sources.<br />  Thiru Murugan -<br />  Is set of 5 essays - it doesn't belong to any particular genre<br />  Because some essays are critical analysis,some are papers on Philosophy.<br />  Tamil Kandha Puranam - Short summary (in english) and critical Analysis.</p>
<p>  ---</p>
<p>  Now regarding Alwar- dating, his work is as a Historian. (Please see the<br />  Subramaniyapuram example of History of Literature). This work of his is<br />  unparallel and still today considered the reference for nearly all papers<br />  written on Tamil.</p>
<p>  So as a historian person would only look for history.As a Linguist and<br />  reader of literature would only look in finer aspects of the language.</p>
<p>  So to read Zvelebil and expect the philosophical depth or any thing other<br />  than History or as a reader of Literature would end up in a bad way. This<br />  failure is not contributed by the Author.</p>

<p>   Hello Vairam</p>
<p>   Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed the<br />   gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram etc).</p>
<p>   Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />   If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense on<br />   the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that Dr.Zvelebil<br />   may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>   If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />   references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version control<br />   problem irukke?</p>
<p>   Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />   according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />   case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>   Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />   patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />   proper in its explanations.And historians must have a convincing record to<br />   prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our current<br />   human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a bard's<br />   tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>   Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this research<br />   anyway.</p>
<p>   Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />   survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the story<br />   come by?</p>
<p>   I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question all<br />   the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make sense.</p>
<p>   As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil(rest his soul), I am in search of<br />   Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where he<br />   is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a short cut<br />   :-).</p>
<p>   Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was, now<br />   that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or Hector, but<br />   then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />   Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />   Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />   say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />   scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>     Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>     you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />     My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />     said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />     It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>     Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />     history.</p>
<p>     But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to know<br />     what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>     I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had<br />     year ago!</p>
<p>     I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />     believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />     Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what<br />     can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />     Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />     against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />     other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />     finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />     welcome it. Archeology,numismatic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>     Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />     labyrinth again.</p>

<p>       Dear Vairam</p>
<p>       Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west and<br />       studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have<br />       never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>       However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />       anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a<br />       base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or<br />       something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>       I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of Trojan<br />       War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />       Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek<br />       myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of<br />       Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>          He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the<br />          literature itself.</p>
<p>       For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature and<br />       history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />       foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />       not be so.</p>
<p>       Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />       entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />       Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />       Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>       As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />       adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>       I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />       noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem,<br />       while Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just<br />       a simple poet.</p>
<p>       Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself<br />       makes a mile of difference – the usage of that term, on how a person<br />       approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />       literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />       written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>       I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />       location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />       thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from<br />       a spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />       there, it is also difficult to prove …it was not there.<br />       Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as<br />       a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />       with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />       southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for<br />       the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for<br />       it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had<br />       this question posed before too.</p>
<p>       I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />       avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age – his<br />       time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />       there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>       When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it)<br />       was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the<br />       odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />       possible.</p>
<p>       Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this<br />       research?</p>
<p>       Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough<br />       to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience<br />       to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my<br />       opinion.</p>
<p>          Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />          are.</p>
<p>       Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to<br />       it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed – purely due tohis<br />       dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />       tread.</p>
<p>       However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />       relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>       Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />       literature – just as literature and not as an embodied sweatof bhakti<br />       cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these<br />       writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe.</p>
<p>       However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic, even<br />       say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />       These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />       though many do not agree.</p>
<p>       PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some<br />       argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;       <br />       - R<br />       --- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "vairam99" <vairam@  wrote:</p>
<p>         Hi Ravi,<br />         Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data in<br />         his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />         various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his<br />         dating. He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up<br />         their minds.</p>
<p>           Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />           research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />         I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161 of<br />         his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />         Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />         members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he<br />         has left in these pages.</p>
<p>           I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and cultural<br />           onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />           It is anything but natural that these researches would have a base<br />           line that starts with a western ideology.<br />         Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never been<br />         controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />         Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to<br />         my knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his<br />         great work - The Eight Anthologies).<br />         He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />         claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every<br />         book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil<br />         was belived to an off spring of Sanskrit by scholars like KAN<br />         Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than<br />         we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I<br />         request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />         <a href="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html" title="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html">http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html</a></p>
<p>         So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from you<br />         , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />         your views on Dr.Zvelebil's works.</p>

<p>           History does not account for various stories and tales of the<br />           bard, which seems to be having many lines of history before being<br />           sung.</p>
<p>           Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />           research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />           I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and cultural<br />           onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />           It is anything but natural that these researches would have a base<br />           line that starts with a western ideology.</p>
<p>           Nothing wrong, but then there are gaps that can derail a train.</p>

<p>             Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil<br />             Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating<br />             of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this<br />             book for dating of various literature.</p>

        <p>Sampath, history can become myth and myth can become history over time, both are true, not necessarily one or the other. Ravana was a king of lanka ishistory (maybe), ravana had ten heads is myth (most probably). Mary was the mother of Jesus is history but Mary was a virgin mother is myth. Unfortunately people have lost the ability to distinguish what is what. Just <acronym title="For Your Information" FYI</acronym  I am not a history buff like Vairam I am more into myth and story telling. I find it equally difficult as history buffs when people talk of myth like 'fact' (it has origins in some fact that is all).</p>
<p>Another example - Draupadi married to five men is actually metaphysically the soul wedded to its five senses. If you dive deep into metaphysical meaningso f the MAhabharat is a fascinating, rich and unbelivable metaphor for spiritual challenges. Instead of learning from that people waste time debating on how one woman wedded to five men is a 'karpukkarasi', Draupadi was attracted to KArna and even Sri Krishna, on and on the ridiculous arguments continue. That is the sad plight of mistaking myth to be history and fact.</p>

<p>  History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />  history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />  in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />  several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />  of Gandhi etc.)</p>

<p>    Hello Vairam</p>
<p>    Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed<br />  the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram<br />  etc).</p>
<p>    Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??).<br />    If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense<br />  on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that<br />  Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>    If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical<br />  references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version<br />  control problem irukke?</p>
<p>    Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with...<br />  according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this<br />  case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>    Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many<br />  patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be<br />  proper in its explanations.And historians must have a convincing record<br />  to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our<br />  current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a<br />  bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>    Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this<br />  research anyway.</p>
<p>    Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no<br />  survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the<br />  story come by?</p>
<p>    I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question<br />  all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make<br />  sense.</p>
<p>    As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil(rest his soul), I am in search of<br />  Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where<br />  he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a<br />  short cut :-).</p>
<p>    Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was,<br />  now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or<br />  Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />    Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because<br />  Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then<br />  say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our<br />  scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>      Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>      you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />      My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You<br />  said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />      It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>      Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or<br />  history.</p>
<p>      But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to<br />  know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>      I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we<br />  had year ago!</p>
<p>      I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a<br />  believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />      Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and<br />  what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted.<br />      Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held<br />  against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and<br />  other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If<br />  finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to<br />  welcome it. Archeology,numismatic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>      Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the<br />  labyrinth again.</p>

<p>        Dear Vairam</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west<br />  and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I<br />  have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count.</p>
<p>        However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for<br />  anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base<br />  line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something<br />  similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it?</p>
<p>        I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of<br />  Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />        Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the<br />  Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative<br />  study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong!</p>
<p>           He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than<br />  the literature itself.</p>
<p>        For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature<br />  and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological<br />  foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may<br />  not be so.</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is<br />  entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on<br />  Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru<br />  Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>        As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya,<br />  adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>        I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I<br />  noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while<br />  Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple<br />  poet.</p>
<p>        Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by<br />  itself makes a mile of difference ? the usage of that term, on how a<br />  person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between<br />  literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had<br />  written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>        I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the<br />  location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such<br />  thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a<br />  spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was<br />  there, it is also difficult to prove ?it was not there.<br />        Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran<br />  as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity,<br />  with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the<br />  southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the<br />  Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I<br />  believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this<br />  question posed before too.</p>
<p>        I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru<br />  avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age ?<br />  his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why<br />  there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>        When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below<br />  it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas,<br />  the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite<br />  possible.</p>
<p>        Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all<br />  this research?</p>
<p>        Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble<br />  enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the<br />  experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am<br />  entitled to my opinion.</p>
<p>           Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we<br />  are.</p>
<p>        Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research<br />  to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed ? purely due to his<br />  dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to<br />  tread.</p>
<p>        However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very<br />  relevant in all comparisons.</p>
<p>        Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these<br />  literature ? just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of<br />  bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of<br />  these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with<br />  awe.</p>
<p>        However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic,<br />  even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />        These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions,<br />  though many do not agree.</p>
<p>        PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some<br />  argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514;        <br />        - R<br />        --- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "vairam99" <vairam@  wrote:</p>
<p>          Hi Ravi,<br />          Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data<br />  in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by<br />  various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating.<br />  He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>            Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and<br />  research, his sequence has small yet important gaps.<br />          I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161<br />  of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all<br />  Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all<br />  members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has<br />  left in these pages.</p>
<p>            I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and<br />  cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts.<br />            It is anything but natural that these researches would have a<br />  base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />          Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never<br />  been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil<br />  Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my<br />  knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great<br />  work - The Eight Anthologies).<br />          He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the<br />  claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of<br />  his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived<br />  nearly 1990 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of<br />  Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed<br />  out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short<br />  biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog<br />  <a href="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html" title="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html">http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html</a></p>
<p>          So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from<br />  you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear<br />  your views on Dr.Zvelebil's works.</p>

<p>              Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's<br />  Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating<br />  of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for<br />  dating of various literature.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>You are clearly getting confused with this topic.<br />Let me start of with the basics,</p>
<p>Karthigesu Sivathambi in his work"literary history of Tamil Literature" details the two modes of history through Literature.</p>
<p>Literary History and History of Literature.</p>
<p>Literary History:<br />To study the literature to understand the people who have written the literature , their social status, their economic status, their pass times etc. Tamils 1800 years ago,Study in Tamil by Raghava Iyengar.<br />All of Sangam Tamilians history is Literary History.</p>
<p>Say lets take eg. lets take the Movie Subramaniya Puram. Suppose after some500 years they see this movie.<br />They would make observations like in 1980s they used to was pant and shirt , women used to were Sari. Around Madurai region there was lot of violence.Heaving beard was a style.Rajnikanth was a very popular actor.</p>
<p>History of Literature:<br />To study the history of the literature itself rather than the content of it. Books like Tamil Literature by Venugopala Pillai, History of Tamil Literature by Kamil Zvelebil,History of Tamil Literature by Jesudasan.</p>
<p>This approach is like when people watch Subramaniyapuram 500 years later, they would observe(if they didnt know when the movie released)<br />The movie must not have been taken in 1980s since<br />The photography standards have improved<br />It has heavy influence of Spanish cinema which is very late development<br />The actor Sasi Kumar can also be found nearly in the same get up in film Nadodigal which is closely dates around 2010.<br />The same can be said of other cast because all of them seem to be of the period around 2010.<br />This film should have been released before the movie Pasanga,Mothi Vilayadu,Saroja because all these movie have mentioned Suramaniyapuram.<br />SO Lower limit of the films age is around 2009 .<br />The movie also seems to have been a realistic movie.This wave was supposedly started by a movie Kadhal. So the upper limit can be kept as 2005.<br />So the movie should have been released in some where between 2007-2008.</p>
<p>----<br />These are the available methods of study for Reader of History in literature. So it is not important for the history scholar to analyse the filming technique ( though he would touch on it to say - as an evidence) or production values or acting skills of the film.<br />Reader of History can only do this much.</p>
<p>If you want whole analysis of the film,then only a film critic can do it , or if you want to know the religious aspects of the film only religious expert can do it.</p>
<p>History expert when taking a subject can write based only upon proven evidences or related to History in the above mentioned approaches. </p>
<p>---<br />If your reader of literature or a Linguist you can give critical analysis on a subject. This is different from commentary.A critical analysis of Thirumanthiram would have what diseases are being discussed - comparison of the remedy with the present day remedies- all these.<br />---</p>
<p>Dr.Zvelebil's Tamil Literature- the one under discussion for the Alwar content is work of History on Tamil Literature.</p>
<p>Smile of Murugan is work of linguist in trying to popularize a language called Tamil to the world.</p>
<p>His Murugan works:<br />Tamil Traditions of Subrahmanya Murga -<br />Chronicles all the legends and myths in first part and gives critical analysis on the sources.<br />Thiru Murugan - <br />Is set of 5 essays - it doesn't belong to any particular genre <br />Because some essays are critical analysis,some are papers on Philosophy.<br />Tamil Kandha Puranam - Short summary (in english) and critical Analysis.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Now regarding Alwar- dating, his work is as a Historian. (Please see the Subramaniyapuram example of History of Literature). This work of his is unparallel and still today considered the reference for nearly all papers written on Tamil. </p>
<p>So as a historian person would only look for history.As a Linguist and reader of literature would only look in finer aspects of the language.</p>
<p>So to read Zvelebil and expect the philosophical depth or any thing other than History or as a reader of Literature would end up in a bad way. This failure is not contributed by the Author.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hello Vairam</p>
<p>  Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram etc).</p>
<p>  Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??). <br />  If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>  If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version control problem irukke?</p>
<p>  Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with... according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this case,history has no standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>  Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be proper in its explanations.And historians must have a convincing record to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>  Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this research anyway.</p>
<p>  Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the story come by?</p>
<p>  I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make sense.</p>
<p>  As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil(rest his soul), I am in search of Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a short cut :-). </p>
<p>  Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was, now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />  Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our scientific mind to accept.</p>

<p>    Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>    you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />    My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />    It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>    Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or history.</p>
<p>    But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to knowwhat gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>    I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had year ago!</p>
<p>    I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />    Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted. <br />    Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If finding evidenceto validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to welcome it. Archeology,numismatic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>    Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the labyrinth again.</p>

<p>      Dear Vairam</p>
<p>      Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have neverdisputed that, will never do that too, in that count. </p>
<p>      However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it? </p>
<p>      I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />      Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong! </p>
<p>         He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than theliterature itself. </p>
<p>      For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>      Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>      As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>      I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>      Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference ? the usage of that term, on how a person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>      I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is also difficult to prove ?it was not there. <br />      Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran asa brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthaniexistance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed before too.</p>
<p>      I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age ? his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>      When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible. </p>
<p>      Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>      Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enoughto accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<p>         Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p>
<p>      Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research toit, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed ? purely due to his dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to tread.</p>
<p>      However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevant in all comparisons. </p>
<p>      Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these literature ? just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings,though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>      However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic, even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />      These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions, though many do not agree.</p>
<p>      PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514; </p>

<p>        Hi Ravi,<br />        Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating. He leaves tothe reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>          Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. <br />        I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161 of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all Indianscholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has left in these pages.</p>
<p>          I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts. <br />          It is anything but natural that these researches would have a base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />        Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my knowledge who hasdone research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great work - The Eight Anthologies). <br />        He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived to an of0 he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan inhis blog <a href="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html" title="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html">http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html</a></p>
<p>        So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from you, which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear your views on Dr.Zvelebil's works.</p>

<p>            Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's TamilLiterature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

        <p>I fully agree with you, Ravi.</p>
<p>My English Professor, defined king as a small emperor and emperor as a<br />big king.</p>
<p>History, when proved, is a small or a portion myth; and, when validated<br />history is proved false, it again becomes a myth. Myth is also history<br />in a sense, because we have several versions of myths, as we have<br />several versions of history (jinnah, freedom movement, partition, role<br />of Gandhi etc.)</p>
<p>It is preferable not to get swayed or bulldozed by the 'scientific' tag<br />attached to extrapolated and biased versions of 'history'.</p>

        <p>Hello Vairam</p>
<p>Enna sir periya varthai, hijack, ellam solaringa... :-) I have posed the gap questions on the previous email (Refer Sooran - Mahendra puram etc).</p>
<p>Alwars are real, but what they sung were a myth..(??). <br />If one alwar used another one's theory as a base line, it makes sense on the base line start concept, which again comes back to me that Dr.Zvelebil may have had a western base line.</p>
<p>If Murugan is a myth, then why are there so much different historical references ? Poratha kulapathukku, pal veru Murugan vere, version control problem irukke?</p>
<p>Ancient Dravidian Murugan or Ceyyon, was still a myth to start with... according to Dr.Zvelebil and other western scholars??. In this case,history hasno standing without the strong myth background.</p>
<p>Myth-History may not always,coexist, especially where history has many patches where as myth does not, it is, but natural, that history MUST be properin its explanations.And historians must have a convincing record to prove when researching myth or our foundational thoughts.If our current human mind cannot comprehend, we cannot conclude that this is a bard's tale and cannot be real.</p>
<p>Without Murugan the myth, what would have been a start for this research anyway.</p>
<p>Itheppadi irukkuna, there is a story about a mid sea accident with no survivors, what an oxymoron! If there are no survivors, how does the story come by?</p>
<p>I am a believer, but I do have a rational thought. I do not question all the contemporary historical thoughts, Simply those that do not make sense.</p>
<p>As much as yourself or Dr.Zvelebil(rest his soul), I am in search of Murugan, just that I expect him in reality.If history can show me where he is or what he is, it would make my life more easy and possibly a short cut :-). </p>
<p>Heinrich Schliemann found Troy, exactly where Iliad stated Troy was, now that is myth becoming history. Troy is not without Achilles or Hector, but then was Achillies the son of Thetis - a sea nymph.<br />Troy is real - history it became one from the myth, but just because Achilles's birth data is not documented or found, we cannot, until then say Thetis was not a sea nymph, how ever hard it would be for our scientific mind toaccept.</p>

<p>  you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />  My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You saidyou have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />  It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>  Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or history.</p>
<p>  But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>  I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had year ago!</p>
<p>  I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />  Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted. <br />  Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to welcome it. Archeology,numismatic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>  Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the labyrinth again.</p>

<p>    Dear Vairam</p>
<p>    Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count. </p>
<p>    However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for anything,no one can start any such colossal work without having a base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it? </p>
<p>    I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of Trojan War(he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />    Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of Murugawith Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong! </p>
<p>       He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. </p>
<p>    For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundationmakes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>    Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitledto the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga is nevercomplete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>    As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>    I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticedthat he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>    Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference ? the usage of that term, on how a person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>    I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughtson the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is alsodifficult to prove ?it was not there. <br />    Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as abrother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed before too.</p>
<p>    I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudianalysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age ? his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>    When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it) wasonly found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds ofreal history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible. </p>
<p>    Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>    Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<p>       Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p>
<p>    Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed ? purely due to his dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to tread.</p>
<p>    However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevantin all comparisons. </p>
<p>    Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these literature ? just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of bhakti cult orbelief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>    However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic, even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />    These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions, though many do not agree.</p>
<p>    PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some argumentativequalities of Nakkirar &#61514; </p>

<p>      Hi Ravi,<br />      Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data in hisbook Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating. He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>        Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. <br />      I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161 of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all members of thegroup if you can let us know the important gaps he has left in these pages.</p>
<p>        I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts. <br />        It is anything but natural that these researches would have a base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />      Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great work - The Eight Anthologies). <br />      He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived to an off he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog <a href="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html" title="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html">http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html</a></p>
<p>      So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from you ,which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear your viewson Dr.Zvelebil's works.</p>

<p>          Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

        <p>I am not any expert on the topic being debated but i whole heartedly agree with Vairam's stance - myth and history cannot co exist. </p>
<p>The compulsion to push myth as history exists in every culture and is overwhelmingly so in ours. What that does is pollute history with stories and take away the metaphysical and spiritual dimensions of the myth.</p>
<p>There are two lives every human has - one that is spiritual, inner life andthereby related to mythology and para psychology - the outer factual life that is related to history, archaeology and other factual sciences. Zvebil, George Hart and others are analysing it from the latter standpoint - to them Murugan is a concept whose origins are analysed in dry neutral ways. Itis unrelated to Variar swamigal's or Arunagiri's concept of Murugan as a divine spirit. </p>
<p>Each perspective deserves credit depending on what the individual is looking for that is all.</p>

<p>  Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or history.</p>
<p>  But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>  I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had year ago!</p>
<p>  I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />  Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted. <br />  Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held against various Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to welcome it. Archeology,numismatic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>  Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the labyrinth again.</p>

<p>    Dear Vairam</p>
<p>    Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count. </p>
<p>    However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for anything,no one can start any such colossal work without having a base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it? </p>
<p>    I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of Trojan War(he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />    Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek myth apart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of Murugawith Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong! </p>
<p>       He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. </p>
<p>    For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundationmakes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>    Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitledto the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga is nevercomplete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>    As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>    I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticedthat he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>    Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference ? the usage of that term, on how a person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>    I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughtson the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is alsodifficult to prove ?it was not there. <br />    Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as abrother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed before too.</p>
<p>    I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudianalysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age ? his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>    When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it) wasonly found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds ofreal history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible. </p>
<p>    Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>    Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<p>       Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p>
<p>    Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed ? purely due to his dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to tread.</p>
<p>    However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevantin all comparisons. </p>
<p>    Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these literature ? just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of bhakti cult orbelief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>    However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic, even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />    These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions, though many do not agree.</p>
<p>    PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some argumentativequalities of Nakkirar &#61514; </p>

<p>      Hi Ravi,<br />      Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data in hisbook Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating. He leaves to the reader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>        Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. <br />      I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161 of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all members of thegroup if you can let us know the important gaps he has left in these pages.</p>
<p>        I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts. <br />        It is anything but natural that these researches would have a base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />      Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great work - The Eight Anthologies). <br />      He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived to an off he has done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughter Kanamma). I request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan in his blog <a href="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html" title="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html">http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html</a></p>
<p>      So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from you ,which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear your viewson Dr.Zvelebil's works.</p>

<p>          Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

        <p>Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or history.</p>
<p>But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had year ago!</p>
<p>I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted. <br />Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held againstvarious Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to welcome it. Archeology,numismatic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the labyrinth again.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Vairam</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Vairam</p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count. </p>
<p>  However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it? </p>
<p>  I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />  Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek mythapart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong! </p>
<p>     He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. </p>
<p>  For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>  As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>  I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>  Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference ? the usage of that term, on how a person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>  I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spot such aswhere Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is also difficult to prove ?it was not there. <br />  Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed before too.</p>
<p>  I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age ? his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinankudi?</p>
<p>  When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible. </p>
<p>  Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<p>     Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p>
<p>  Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to it,Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed ? purely due to his dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to tread.</p>
<p>  However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevant in all comparisons. </p>
<p>  Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these literature ? just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>  However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic, even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />  These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions, though many do not agree.</p>
<p>  PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514; </p>

<p>    Hi Ravi,<br />    Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating. He leaves to thereader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>      Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. <br />    I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161 of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has left in these pages.</p>
<p>      I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and cultural onsetprior to researching dravidian scripts. <br />      It is anything but natural that these researches would have a base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />    Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great work - The Eight Anthologies). <br />    He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived to an off sphas done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughterKanamma). I request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan in hisblog <a href="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html" title="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html">http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html</a></p>
<p>    So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear your views on Dr.Zvelebil's works.</p>

<p>        Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

        <p>Hi Ravi ,</p>
<p>you seemed to have hijacked the topic.<br />My question was very specific regarding the pages in discussion. You said you have feeling that there is gaps in his dating of alwars.<br />It would be better if you can explain it.</p>
<p>Murugan its always argumentative in this forum whether its myth or history.</p>
<p>But Alwars are for sure history and not Myth - and I would like to know what gaps you have found in that.</p>
<p>I guess you are still in Hangover over the Murugan History debate we had year ago!</p>
<p>I surely do not wish to start the Murugan debate again. You are a believer and I am in search of History. No use we two arguing.<br />Writer of History can base his arguments and on what is found and what can be proved or at least tentatively proved/accepted. <br />Myth and history can never co exist. Your argument can also be held againstvarious Indian Scholars then - Romila Thapar, Jesudasan and other major Tamil Scholars. It has no western mind applied to it. If finding evidence to validate a claim is western mind - then I am here to welcome it. Archeology,numismatic are product of western mind.</p>
<p>Lets put this talk very specific to Alwars else we are entering the labyrinth again.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Vairam</p>

<blockquote><p>  Dear Vairam</p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil was an undisputed scholar who came in from the west and studied Dravidian history more than any of us can even imagine. I have never disputed that, will never do that too, in that count. </p>
<p>  However, please understand that there MUST be a base line for anything, no one can start any such colossal work without having a base line, a starting point. For many of us it was PS or SS or something similar. For Dr.Zvelebil, who or what was it? </p>
<p>  I believe it could have been from Odysseus the Greek hero of Trojan War (he mentions about this fav char in his article Hippalos).<br />  Dr.Zvelebil, was very much knowledgeable and interested in the Greek mythapart from various languages. He even made a comparative study of Muruga with Dionysus. Again, nothing wrong! </p>
<p>     He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. </p>
<p>  For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature and history of literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>  As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivul ariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>  I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while Guru Arunagiri (even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>  Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference ? the usage of that term, on how a person approaches a specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>  I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the location of Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spot such aswhere Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is also difficult to prove ?it was not there. <br />  Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed before too.</p>
<p>  I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age ? his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinankudi?</p>
<p>  When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible. </p>
<p>  Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>  Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to question his findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<p>     Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p>
<p>  Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to it,Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed ? purely due to his dedication on research of these ancient works, which not many dare to tread.</p>
<p>  However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevant in all comparisons. </p>
<p>  Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these literature ? just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>  However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic, even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />  These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions, though many do not agree.</p>
<p>  PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514; </p>

<p>    Hi Ravi,<br />    Dr.Zvelebil most of the time, acts just as accumulator of data in his book Tamil literature. He consolidates all the dating given by various scholar till his time and gives his explanation for his dating. He leaves to thereader to accumulate the data and make up their minds.</p>
<p>      Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. <br />    I sure by making this comment you have read the page 152 to 161 of his great work Tamil Literature. As usual he has given dating of all Indian scholars and his dating. So it would be really helpful to all members of the group if you can let us know the important gaps he has left in these pages.</p>
<p>      I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and cultural onsetprior to researching dravidian scripts. <br />      It is anything but natural that these researches would have a base line that starts with a western ideology.<br />    Unlike George L Hart or A K Ramanujan - his works have never been controversial. He was more interested in the History of Tamil Literature than the literature itself. Only other western scholar to my knowledge who has done research on Tamil history is JR Marr (his great work - The Eight Anthologies). <br />    He was one of the western scholars to have put weight behind the claim for Tamil as a classical Language(argued literary in every book of his , how ancient the language was - in a time where Tamil was belived to an off sphas done field research in Tamil. Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are(N.Ganesan sir pointed out he calls his daughterKanamma). I request you to read his short biography by Dr.Elangovan in hisblog <a href="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html" title="http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html">http://muelangovan.blogspot.com/2008/11/17-11-1927.html</a></p>
<p>    So put such charge on him would require some valid reasons from you , which I am sure you would have it. I wouldbe interested to hear your views on Dr.Zvelebil's works.</p>

<p>        Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

<p>For me, there in is one of the issues. I believe the literature and historyof literature are very closely intertwined, my mythological foundation makes it believe so, a hard line western or dk thought may not be so. </p>
<p>Dr.Zvelebil wrote history, not the biography of Murugan. He is entitled to the crown on his historical findings, though a study on Muruga is never complete 'even' with a total analysis of Guru Arunagiri's works.</p>
<p>As said by the Guru: "Ariya ariya ariyaatha, adigal ariya, adiyeenum,arivulariyum arivura, arulvaaye"</p>
<p>I have read his translation on Anubuthi, one of Guru's works. I noticed that he was emphasizing on the literal value of the poem, while Guru Arunagiri(even according to Dr.Zvelebil) who was not just a simple poet. </p>
<p>Ex: Verse 51, Guru Arunagiri uses the term `Guhane', which by itself makes a mile of difference ? the usage of that term, on how a person approachesa specific concept, there is the difference between literacy and historical interpretation of literacy. I think I had written about this earlier too.</p>
<p>I am not convinced on his theory on Cur becoming Curan etc, so the locationof Mahendrapuram is dismissed as myth and obviously many such thoughts on the subject. While it is difficult to excavate a city from a spot such as where Mahendrapuram would have existed to prove it was there, it is also difficult to prove ?it was not there. <br />Tarakasuran is termed as a Northern demon, later linked with Suran as a brother etc. To some degree, there seems to be a named similarity, with a demon that was possessing similar qualities somewhere in the southern vindya ranges. Thiruthani is said to be a resting place for the Lord post Tarakasuran destruction, again history has no clue for it. I believe Thiruthani existance is way before pallava time, i had this question posed before too.</p>
<p>I do not see the difference between Bogar's palani and Thiru avinankudi analysis as much as I would like to see. Bogar's age ? his time line of alchemy practice vs. construction of palani idol, why there and not at Avinan kudi?</p>
<p>When 1800 year old pallava construction (and sangam works below it) was only found in 2008/9 even so it was near to the great pagodas, the odds of real history of Murugan not being clearly found is quite possible. </p>
<p>Ultimately, does he conclude the existence of Murugan after all this research? </p>
<p>Dr.Zvelebil does have excellent work accomplished, I am humble enough to accept that I neither posses the qualification nor the experience to questionhis findings. However, just like him, I am entitled to my opinion. </p>
<blockquote><p>   Nearly 40 years of Tamil study- makes him more Tamilian than we are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tamilian, is a feeling that does not tie an age factor or research to it, Dr.Zvelebil was a tamil by heart, agreed ? purely due to his dedication onresearch of these ancient works, which not many dare to tread.</p>
<p>However, to generalize the words `than we are' may not be very relevant in all comparisons. </p>
<p>Today, there are many excellent tamil scholars who can read these literature ? just as literature and not as an embodied sweat of bhakti cult or belief/faith in the Ultimate. That takes the soul out of these writings, though it makes them a good read some times even with awe. </p>
<p>However, I would price these lower than any contemporary classic, even say they be Sanskrit adopted like tamilian kanda puranam.<br />These poets are tamil too, and nothing wrong with their opinions, though many do not agree.</p>
<p>PS: That I read thiru murugatru padai, I may possess some argumentative qualities of Nakkirar &#61514; </p>

<p>          It is difficult to determine decisively who is ancient among the<br />         nayanmars, nor the Thiruthondar Puranam that lists hagiography of 63 saints<br />         and 9 Thogai adiyargal is conclusively exhaustive. For example, Auvayar is<br />         not in the list. There are countless devotees over the ages have<br />         dedicated themselves to the pathway to realization of God through bhakti.</p>
<p>         Maani-k-ka vasagar is perhaps oldest in the list of 63.</p>

        <p>History does not account for various stories and tales of the bard, which seems to be having many lines of history before being sung.</p>
<p>Even though Zvelebil has a good account of the time line and research, his sequence has small yet important gaps. <br />I am not sure if that is due to his Western native and cultural onset prior to researching dravidian scripts. <br />It is anything but natural that these researches would have a base line that starts with a western ideology.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong, but then there are gaps that can derail a train.</p>

        <p>Agreed, think it must be after the pallava reign.<br />However, there is a specific narasimha temple in Ahobilam where they offer meat to the Lord. I guess that is much older in time line.</p>
<p>There is no documented history on Kannapar ofcourse, so it is difficult to find the time line.<br />Same story with En Kann / Ettu Kudi sirpam's of Lord Muruga. where the sirpi is said to have first lost his thumb after the initial statue, then sculpts exactly the same one again at ettukudi finally his eyes gouged out by a 'chola king'. Lands up doing same act at Enn Kann (using the Lord's eyes - hence Enn Kann).</p>
<p>Was this physically possible ? How was this accomplished? Belief is one thing yet reality is another. </p>
<p>PS: Who was this chola king who did it anyways :-) was he as brutal as the moslem rulers of north ?</p>

Or did shiva stop him when he was in the act of<br />          doing it in his first eye?

<p>            I was merely responding to one of the comments made by Srinivasan<br />          Natarajan<br />            on the subject- "The term true devotion itself is relative. I can never<br />          dare<br />            to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt."</p>
<p>            The points I was trying to make are-</p>
<p>            a. Kannappar (and the alike) demonstrated unconditional, singleminded<br />            and steadfast devotion that surpassed physical sufferings. Therelation<br />          was<br />            one to one with the Lord who tested his devout commitment to the cause.<br />            It is also true in each one of the stories of Nayanars ( thanks for<br />          your<br />            some references to the 63 you have made ).</p>
<p>            Once tested, and proved of his sterling devotion, Kannappa was stopped<br />          from<br />            culling out his second eye-</p>
<p>            " thangan mun ida-k-kung kaiai-th-thadu-k-ka moondradu-k-ku<br />            naaga<br />            kanganar amudavar-k-kuk ' Kannappa nirka' endra... "</p>
<p>            Leading to my second point -</p>
<p>            b. Physical suffering is not the only measure of true devotion.</p>
<p>            c. 'thee midi' rituals can't be compared to devotions exemplified by<br />            the likes of Kannappa.</p>
<p>            Ms. Malathi, thanks for your clarification; it is indeed difficult<br />            to make a distinction of group fervor influenced by social<br />          compulsions from<br />            true devotion.</p>
<p>            In my humble opinion neither physical sufferings demonstrate<br />          devotion, nor<br />            scriptures prescribe them as atonement.</p>
<p>            Your reference to cleaning murky mind is life long sojourn, to realize<br />          that<br />            mind needs cleaning being the first mile stone.</p>
<p>            Sri. Vairam's story is touching demonstration of faith and conviction.<br />            Such experience with divinity could be best cherished by the individuals<br />          who<br />            undergo the encounters.</p>

<p>            If you notice I did not say ` great', only feats. They were judged and<br />            inducted into the hall of fame ( by who - venkat has asked thisquestion<br />            many time).

<p>              There is only one kannappar !!! Hmm, that's the pity, the 63 adorn the<br />              quiet sides of our temples and we are not aware of their feats.<br />              Oferring own hair as a wick, grinding ones elbow for sandal wood,<br />              letting even an assasin go, wanting to give up his life when the king<br />              finds his war killed one saint !!, pillai kari ( oferring ownchild's<br />              meat), tonsuring his daughter on the eve of her marriage ....how many<br />              you want</p>

Several bloody sacrificial practices were<br />                common<br />                during Hindu religious rituals ( tantric sacrificial rituals) in the<br />                period<br />                of social and religious rudderless-ness and vacuum when Buddism and<br />                Jainism<br />                reached their nadir points. The religious practices were given<br />                direction<br />                and attained restoration thorugh the preachings of reformers such as<br />                Adi<br />                Shankara in the 8 th century . Several obnoxious practices such as<br />          Sati<br />                (<br />                co-cremation of widows along with diseased husbands ) continued<br />                socially<br />                well into 19th Century until it was legally banned by the British in<br />                Bengal<br />                around 1829. We know of a few occurrences even during our present<br />                times.</tmsunder@></p>
<p>                Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social<br />          compulsions<br />                and<br />                or for acceptance without semblance of adherence to devotion, even<br />                though<br />                they are colored of religious connotation. Participants of 'Thee<br />                midhi' or shiates' who engage in self beating bloody on thetenth day<br />                of 'moharram' have more fervor and less of everything else.The<br />                performers<br />                no doubt end up in risking bodily injuries.</p>
<p>                There was only one Kannappa nayanar we know of<br />                symbolizing uncondit ional adoration to the Lord he believed and<br />          nursed<br />                by<br />                culling his one eye. We also know that the Lord came to stop him from<br />                doing<br />                further self infliction.</p>
<p>                'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>                The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhias a<br />                strategy<br />                for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite<br />          safety<br />                measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places<br />                you<br />                can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your<br />                feet is<br />                what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day this has<br />                nothing<br />                to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few<br />          laughs<br />                :))</p>

<p>                             Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of<br />                             unflinching faith<br />                       and great courage/trust. In practice though it does lead to<br />          lot<br />                       of<br />                       accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that<br />          the<br />                       appeal does<br />                       not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds<br />          on<br />                       person's<br />                       feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK<br />                       protests<br />                       may be<br />                       anti religious but have some validity for humane reasons such<br />          as<br />                       these.</p>
<p>                             There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith<br />          is<br />                             not<br />                       possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

These festivals, usually<br />          mocked<br />                       by<br />                       the<br />                       Dravidian politicians of TN are a true heritage of Shakti<br />                       worship in<br />                       Tamil<br />                       nadu..</p>
<p>                               But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some<br />                               "unique"<br />                               practice<br />                       separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream<br />          Hinduism<br />                       is<br />                       highly<br />                       flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial<br />                       style<br />                       of<br />                       viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and<br />                       not<br />                       as whole<br />                       and holistic..</p>
<p>                               In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual<br />          is<br />                               indicative<br />                       of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is<br />          worshipped<br />                       durign this<br />                       festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz. Sakthi<br />                       amman,<br />                       Kali<br />                       amman, Mari amman, Gangai amman, Lakshmi amman, Thirumani<br />          amman,<br />                       Draupadi<br />                       amman etc.. The *only* theo-religious principle that*unites*<br />                       all<br />                       these<br />                       ammans is the Shakthi matham (or Shaktam) that has adeep<br />                       philosophy<br />                       and<br />                       great mystic symbolism. In fact, Devi Mahatmyam (also called<br />                       Durga<br />                       Saptashati), a highly revered text in Shakti worshipwhich is<br />                       part<br />                       of<br />                       Markandeya Purana in its last chapter states taht Devi will<br />          take<br />                       literally<br />                       thousands of incarnations on the earth in Kali Yuga to bless<br />          her<br />                       devotees in<br />                       each and every village. Many forms of Devi are also praised.<br />                       Mariamman is<br />                       mentioned ("mahaa maarii swaroopeNa) in teh same breath as<br />                       Vaishnavi<br />                       Devi in<br />                       these verses!</p>
<p>                               ... every one of these Amman temple has Trishulam that<br />                               is<br />                               Shiva's<br />                       emblem and lion (Simha vahanam) that is Shakti's mount .. and<br />          in<br />                       most of<br />                       the Amman temples (mainly Draupadi Amman temples), the<br />                       firewalkers<br />                       shout<br />                       "Govinda Govinda" while jumping into the fire.. So, how does<br />          the<br />                       poster say<br />                       that mother Goddess worship is not influenced by Shaivism,<br />                       Shaktism<br />                       and<br />                       Vaishnavism?</p>
<p>                               Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that<br />                               trasncends the<br />                       ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is<br />                       so<br />                       blatantly<br />                       visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact* that<br />                       calls<br />                       for<br />                       great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                               friends, i congratulate the members and wishthem nice<br />                               event<br />                               on the<br />                       forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                               last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire<br />                               walking) in<br />                       chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the<br />                       street<br />                       corner<br />                       temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50 amman<br />                       temples in<br />                       chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                               no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to<br />          the<br />                               people<br />                       than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman<br />                       followers.<br />                       only the<br />                       remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                               the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal<br />                               kudam<br />                               oorvalam,<br />                       karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswarisongs)are<br />                       halmark of<br />                       these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are<br />                       mostly from<br />                       the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness<br />                       among<br />                       these<br />                       people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                               a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation<br />                               of<br />                               the<br />                       masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of<br />          psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                               mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing<br />          tradition<br />                               which has<br />                       not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or<br />                       christian waves<br />                       in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal<br />          religious<br />                       movements<br />                       have not immobilised these faiths among the majorityof tamil<br />                       community.</p>
<p>                               hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and<br />                               large<br />                               in<br />                       tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping<br />                       ofcourse.<br />                               i have noticed some remnants of hero cult insalem<br />          rural<br />                               district<br />                       pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of<br />                       kalvarayn<br />                       hills.</p>
<p>                               in all these mother god worshiping is that stays after<br />                               2500<br />                               years<br />                       of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

<p>Actually for this topic you can refer to Kamil Zvelebil's Tamil Literature. One good thing about this book is he compares dating of various scholars. Usually after 1975 all works quote this book for dating of various literature.</p>

<p>  <br />good questions venkat</p>
<p>Karaikkal ammai and kannapar are the most early. </p>
<p>Below, clarifications from Sri Subramaniam ( his site <a href="http://www.geocities.com/nayanmars/" title="http://www.geocities.com/nayanmars/">http://www.geocities.com/nayanmars/</a>) - great teacher - most of my posts on periapurnam panels ofdarasuram are with his blessings and guidance ( must thank Dhivakar sir once again for introducing him to me)</p>
<p>Kannappar is mentioned by manikkavasagar in tiruvasagam,  while the language used by ammai dates her between 2 - 5th C and not later than that for sure. </p>

<p>        I was merely responding to one of the comments made by Srinivasan<br />      Natarajan<br />        on the subject- "The term true devotion itself is relative. I can never<br />      dare<br />        to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt."</p>
<p>        The points I was trying to make are-</p>
<p>        a. Kannappar (and the alike) demonstrated unconditional, single minded<br />        and steadfast devotion that surpassed physical sufferings. The relation<br />      was<br />        one to one with the Lord who tested his devout commitment to the cause.<br />        It is also true in each one of the stories of Nayanars ( thanks for<br />      your<br />        some references to the 63 you have made ).</p>
<p>        Once tested, and proved of his sterling devotion, Kannappa was stopped<br />      from<br />        culling out his second eye-</p>
<p>        " thangan mun ida-k-kung kaiai-th-thadu- k-ka moondradu-k- ku<br />        naaga<br />        kanganar amudavar-k-kuk ' Kannappa nirka' endra... "</p>
<p>        Leading to my second point -</p>
<p>        b. Physical suffering is not the only measure of true devotion.</p>
<p>        c. 'thee midi' rituals can't be compared to devotions exemplified by<br />        the likes of Kannappa.</p>
<p>        Ms. Malathi, thanks for your clarification; it is indeed difficult<br />        to make a distinction of group fervor influenced by social<br />      compulsions from<br />        true devotion.</p>
<p>        In my humble opinion neither physical sufferings demonstrate<br />      devotion, nor<br />        scriptures prescribe them as atonement.</p>
<p>        Your reference to cleaning murky mind is life long sojourn, to realize<br />      that<br />        mind needs cleaning being the first mile stone.</p>
<p>        Sri. Vairam's story is touching demonstration of faith and conviction.<br />        Such experience with divinity could be best cherished by the individuals<br />      who<br />        undergo the encounters.</p>
<p>        Best regards,</p>

<p>        Hi Malathi</p>
<p>        If you notice I did not say ` great', only feats. They were judged and<br />        inducted into the hall of fame ( by who - venkat has asked this question<br />        many time).

<p>        I was only wanting to highlight the rest of the elite group as a reply to<br />        below statement by our good member and that there are many more such<br />      feats<br />        in tiruthondarthogai.</p>

Several bloody sacrificial practiceswere<br />            common<br />            during Hindu religious rituals ( tantric sacrificial rituals) in the<br />            period<br />            of social and religious rudderless-ness and vacuum when Buddismand<br />            Jainism<br />            reached their nadir points.

Several obnoxious practices suchas<br />      Sati<br />            (<br />            co-cremation of widows along with diseased husbands ) continued<br />            socially<br />            well into 19th Century until it was legally banned by the British in<br />            Bengal<br />            around 1829. We know of a few occurrences even during our present<br />            times.</tmsunder@></p>
<p>            Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social<br />      compulsions<br />            and<br />            or for acceptance without semblance of adherence to devotion, even<br />            though<br />            they are colored of religious connotation. Participants of 'Thee<br />            midhi' or shiates' who engage in self beating bloody on the tenth day<br />            of 'moharram' have more fervor and less of everything else. The<br />            performers<br />            no doubt end up in risking bodily injuries.</p>
<p>            There was only one Kannappa nayanar we know of<br />            symbolizing uncondit ional adoration to the Lord he believed and<br />      nursed<br />            by<br />            culling his one eye. We also know that the Lord came to stop him from<br />            doing<br />            further self infliction.</p>
<p>            'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>            The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a<br />            strategy<br />            for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite<br />      safety<br />            measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places<br />            you<br />            can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your<br />            feet is<br />            what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day thishas<br />            nothing<br />            to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few<br />      laughs<br />            :))</p>

<p>                         Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of<br />                         unflinching faith<br />                   and great courage/trust. In practice though it does leadto<br />      lot<br />                   of<br />                   accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that<br />      the<br />                   appeal does<br />                   not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds<br />      on<br />                   person's<br />                   feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK<br />                   protests<br />                   may be<br />                   anti religious but have some validity for humane reasonssuch<br />      as<br />                   these.</p>
<p>                         There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith<br />      is<br />                         not<br />                   possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                           In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual<br />      is<br />                           indicative<br />                   of its holistic Hindu character.

<p>                           friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice<br />                           event<br />                           on the<br />                   forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                           last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire<br />                           walking) in<br />                   chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the<br />                   street<br />                   corner<br />                   temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50amman<br />                   temples in<br />                   chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                           no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to<br />      the<br />                           people<br />                   than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman<br />                   followers.<br />                   only the<br />                   remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                           the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal<br />                           kudam<br />                           oorvalam,<br />                   karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are<br />                   halmark of<br />                   these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are<br />                   mostly from<br />                   the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness<br />                   among<br />                   these<br />                   people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                           a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation<br />                           of<br />                           the<br />                   masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of<br />      psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                           mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing<br />      tradition<br />                           which has<br />                   not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or<br />                   christian waves<br />                   in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal<br />      religious<br />                   movements<br />                   have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil<br />                   community.</p>
<p>                           hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and<br />                           large<br />                           in<br />                   tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping<br />                   ofcourse.<br />                           i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem<br />      rural<br />                           district<br />                   pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of<br />                   kalvarayn<br />                   hills.</p>
<p>                           in all these mother god worshiping is that staysafter<br />                           2500<br />                           years<br />                   of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>

        <p>It is difficult to determine decisively who is ancient among the nayanmars,nor the Thiruthondar Puranam that lists hagiography of 63 saints and 9 Thogai adiyargal is conclusively exhaustive. For example, Auvayar is not in the list. There are countless devotees over the ages have dedicated?themselves to the pathway to realization of God through bhakti. </p>
<p>Maani-k-ka vasagar is perhaps oldest in the list of 63.</p>

<p>      While on the topic, Did kannappar put his leg on the lingam while<br />      gouging his other eye. Or did shiva stop him when he was in the act of<br />      doing it in his first eye?

<p>        I was merely responding to one of the comments made by Srinivasan<br />      Natarajan<br />        on the subject- "The term true devotion itself is relative. I can never<br />      dare<br />        to call Kannappa Nayanar sacrificing his eyes as stunt."</p>
<p>        The points I was trying to make are-</p>
<p>        a. Kannappar (and the alike) demonstrated unconditional, single minded<br />        and steadfast devotion that surpassed physical sufferings. The relation<br />      was<br />        one to one with the Lord who tested his devout commitment to the cause.<br />        It is also true in each one of the stories of Nayanars ( thanks for<br />      your<br />        some references to the 63 you have made ).</p>
<p>        Once tested, and proved of his sterling devotion, Kannappa was stopped<br />      from<br />        culling out his second eye-</p>
<p>        " thangan mun ida-k-kung kaiai-th-thadu- k-ka moondradu-k- ku<br />        naaga<br />        kanganar amudavar-k-kuk ' Kannappa nirka' endra... "</p>
<p>        Leading to my second point -</p>
<p>        b. Physical suffering is not the only measure of true devotion.</p>
<p>        c. 'thee midi' rituals can't be compared to devotions exemplified by<br />        the likes of Kannappa.</p>
<p>        Ms. Malathi, thanks for your clarification; it is indeed difficult<br />        to make a distinction of group fervor influenced by social<br />      compulsions from<br />        true devotion.</p>
<p>        In my humble opinion neither physical sufferings demonstrate<br />      devotion, nor<br />        scriptures prescribe them as atonement.</p>
<p>        Your reference to cleaning murky mind is life long sojourn, to realize<br />      that<br />        mind needs cleaning being the first mile stone.</p>
<p>        Sri. Vairam's story is touching demonstration of faith and conviction.<br />        Such experience with divinity could be best cherished by the individuals<br />      who<br />        undergo the encounters.</p>

<p>        Hi Malathi</p>
<p>        If you notice I did not say ` great', only feats. They were judged and<br />        inducted into the hall of fame ( by who - venkat has asked this question<br />        many time). To understand why and what were the criteria etc, needsa<br />        measure, judgement and understanding that a contemporary yardstick will<br />      not<br />        do justice.</p>
<p>        I was only wanting to highlight the rest of the elite group as a reply to<br />        below statement by our good member and that there are many more such<br />      feats<br />        in tiruthondarthogai.</p>
<p>        " here was only one Kannappa nayanar we know of symbolizing uncondit<br />      ional<br />        adoration to the Lord he believed and nursed by culling his one eye."</p>

<p>        I think on terms with Sri TMS that some of these are social compulsions<br />      and<br />        some are pure fervour that is hard to categorize. I think things like<br />        'pillai kari' are not things one should eulogize in these times andage.<br />      It<br />        is also somewhat indicative of our own double standards isn't it not ..we<br />        think Jayadeva's example of a woman risking adultery to prove her love to<br />        the lord is obscene but we think a man cooking his child to prove is<br />        devotion is a great feat???</p>

The religious practices were given<br />            direction<br />            and attained restoration thorugh the preachings of reformers such as<br />            Adi<br />            Shankara in the 8 th century . Several obnoxious practices suchas<br />      Sati<br />            (<br />            co-cremation of widows along with diseased husbands ) continued<br />            socially<br />            well into 19th Century until it was legally banned by the British in<br />            Bengal<br />            around 1829. We know of a few occurrences even during our present<br />            times.</tmsunder@></p>
<p>            Some of these extreme rituals to me appear to be of social<br />      compulsions<br />            and<br />            or for acceptance without semblance of adherence to devotion, even<br />            though<br />            they are colored of religious connotation. Participants of 'Thee<br />            midhi' or shiates' who engage in self beating bloody on the tenth day<br />            of 'moharram' have more fervor and less of everything else. The<br />            performers<br />            no doubt end up in risking bodily injuries.</p>
<p>            There was only one Kannappa nayanar we know of<br />            symbolizing uncondit ional adoration to the Lord he believed and<br />      nursed<br />            by<br />            culling his one eye. We also know that the Lord came to stop him from<br />            doing<br />            further self infliction.</p>
<p>            'Thee midhi' sure does not belong to that genre.</p>

<p>            The motivational speaker Anthony Robbins adapted thee midhi as a<br />            strategy<br />            for people to overcome chronic fears. Of course with appropraite<br />      safety<br />            measures attached. If you walk very fast and step in the right places<br />            you<br />            can do it but if one coal decides to turn up and burn brightly your<br />            feet is<br />            what it needs to feed on. All said and done in present day thishas<br />            nothing<br />            to do with devotion so perhaps better enjoy goundamani for a few<br />      laughs<br />            :))</p>

<p>                     Calling Theemidhi as a stunt in Devotion seems to be like an<br />                   acute criticism. The term true devotion itself is relative.

<p>                         Dear Natarajan, the concept of Thee midhi is one of<br />                         unflinching faith<br />                   and great courage/trust. In practice though it does leadto<br />      lot<br />                   of<br />                   accidents, often times hidden to the general public so that<br />      the<br />                   appeal does<br />                   not go away. I have seen myself personally lot of burn wounds<br />      on<br />                   person's<br />                   feet in Kovai during thee midhi for Koniamman Thiruvizha.DK<br />                   protests<br />                   may be<br />                   anti religious but have some validity for humane reasonssuch<br />      as<br />                   these.</p>
<p>                         There is a saying in Srimad Bhagavadam that pure faith<br />      is<br />                         not<br />                   possible in Kaliyuga. This is one of those things.</p>

<p>                           But the poster's mindset of viewing this as some<br />                           "unique"<br />                           practice<br />                   separate from Shiava, Vaishnava religion and mainstream<br />      Hinduism<br />                   is<br />                   highly<br />                   flawed... and is probably a result of Euro-Christian- colonial<br />                   style<br />                   of<br />                   viewing Hindu culture only as bits and pieces and fragment and<br />                   not<br />                   as whole<br />                   and holistic..</p>
<p>                           In fact, even a casual analysis of thee midhi ritual<br />      is<br />                           indicative<br />                   of its holistic Hindu character. The "Amman" that is<br />      worshipped<br />                   durign this<br />                   festival are various manifestations of the Devi - viz.

<p>                           Its all part of a great syncretic Hindu Dharma that<br />                           trasncends the<br />                   ideas and barriers of "high culture" and "low culture" that is<br />                   so<br />                   blatantly<br />                   visible in other religions/cultures. . It is *this fact*that<br />                   calls<br />                   for<br />                   great pride and celebration!</p>

<p>                           friends, i congratulate the members and wish them nice<br />                           event<br />                           on the<br />                   forthcoming conference. i will attend such meets in future.</p>
<p>                           last 30 days there were a series of thee midhis(fire<br />                           walking) in<br />                   chidambaram at the verious amman temples. starting from the<br />                   street<br />                   corner<br />                   temples to the thillai kali temple there are about 40-50amman<br />                   temples in<br />                   chidambaram town limits.</p>
<p>                           no other religious occasion is so deeply attached to<br />      the<br />                           people<br />                   than these amman festivals. 80% of the people are amman<br />                   followers.<br />                   only the<br />                   remaining are exclusively siva or perumal worshipers.</p>
<p>                           the thee midhi, various type of body piercings, pal<br />                           kudam<br />                           oorvalam,<br />                   karakatam and musical recitals(mostly old L.R.Eswari songs)are<br />                   halmark of<br />                   these festives. women involvement is maximum. the devotees are<br />                   mostly from<br />                   the downtrodden communities. i have not found th seriousness<br />                   among<br />                   these<br />                   people on these days than anyother occasion.</p>
<p>                           a true occasion of collective unconscious assimilation<br />                           of<br />                           the<br />                   masses. a testimony to the jungian theories of<br />      psycho-analysis.</p>
<p>                           mother god worshiping is the oldest continuing<br />      tradition<br />                           which has<br />                   not been replaced by buddhism,saivism, vaishnavism, islam or<br />                   christian waves<br />                   in tamil country. even the modern atheistic or liberal<br />      religious<br />                   movements<br />                   have not immobilised these faiths among the majority of tamil<br />                   community.</p>
<p>                           hero worshiping and animist beleifs have waned by and<br />                           large<br />                           in<br />                   tamilnadu. if we do not count muruga cult as hero worshiping<br />                   ofcourse.<br />                           i have noticed some remnants of hero cult in salem<br />      rural<br />                           district<br />                   pockets and some animist practices among the aborigines of<br />                   kalvarayn<br />                   hills.</p>
<p>                           in all these mother god worshiping is that staysafter<br />                           2500<br />                           years<br />                   of our religious evolution in tamilnadu.</p>
