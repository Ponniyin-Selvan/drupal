</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Kailasam, very good subject.</p>
<p>Thyagabhoomi was one of Kalki's most inspiring works, it is a <br />natural story of an orthodox brahmin family with the freedom <br />struggle interwoven very appropriately. The way the story <br />was...Sambu Sastry is an orthodox brahmin pundit/landowner who lives <br />in Nedungarai, a traditional village. Sastry is a widower and has <br />only daughter Savitri who is his everything. Savitri is a teenager <br />when the story begins and is at home assisting her father with his <br />daily poojas, taking care of cattle and cooking. Her father is <br />looking for a bridegroom for her. He is also a very progressive man <br />who is often seen visitng slum and being friends with Nallaan and <br />Ponni (Kalki's standard rural pair:)) which antagonises his <br />relationship with orthodox brahmin community. During a flood he <br />opens his cattle shed and gives shelter to all slum dwellers and the <br />brahmins ex communicate him. </p>
<p>There is a great dialogue in the cattle shed where cows talk about <br />human beliefs and caste problems. I am red and you are black but we <br />are still cows why these humans are like this, perhaps you have <br />horns, i have never seen a human with a horn they only behave like <br />they have horns :)) Kalki deserves an award just for that one <br />chapter :))</p>
<p>Sastry eventually finds a groom in Calcutta for his daughter, <br />Sridhar, an England returned handsome man. The family demands very <br />high dowry which he pays by selling his property and without knowing <br />his daughter - Savitri despite being a village girl is <br />very 'thudukku' or outspoken and so he hides the dowry fact from <br />her. She is married and moves to Calcutta. Sridhar in the meantime <br />is having an affair with his secretary Susie who occasionally <br />dresses like a guy and comes home with him. She even comes to the <br />village with him for his marriage, dressed as a guy!! He repeatedly <br />taunts Savitri for her village upbringing (to this day this happens <br />in NRI marriages!!). Meanwhile Sambu Sastry is attracted to Gandhian <br />ideals, sells whatever property he has left and joins the Mahatma's <br />cause. Savitri's in laws do not get any response for more money, so <br />one day they throw her out of the house. She is pregnant and in a <br />strange city not knowing language. Some kindly neighbors put her on <br />some charity ride to Nedungarai hoping to see her dear father. The <br />house is locked, cows and property are sold, other than some curious <br />new neighbors nobody is there. Savitri now in advanced pregnancy <br />faints on the roadside and is taken to the general hospital.</p>
<p>There she delivers a girl, Chaaru and leaves for Chennai in search <br />of her father, with the baby. She sees her father living in <br />a 'kuppam' with nallaan and ponni, and abandons the baby near them. <br />As she foresees her father takes the child and begins to raise her. <br />Savitri meanwhile works somewhere and attracts the attention of <br />another rich woman (who ultimately is her aunt). But the woman takes <br />her on as a guardian,educates her and leaves all her money to her <br />when she dies. She is now rich, educated Umaa Rani, drives around in <br />a car and speaks English. She asks Sastry and Charu to come and live <br />with her in her mansion (Sastry does not recognize his daughter <br />which is a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of 'uruthhal' but perhaps she changed so much). <br />Sastry given to Gandhian ideals refuses but visits often with the <br />child who is very attached to Uma Rani's dog. </acronym></p>
<p>Sridhar meanwhile mishandles some money in his office, his british <br />girl friend leaves him, his father dies and he becomes a fugitive <br />from the law. He is arrested one day and name appears in paper. <br />Savitri goes to police station and pays for his bail, he sees her <br />through jail bars and screams that she is his wife, and the <br />policeman uses his stick on him to shut up. When he is bailed out he <br />goes to Savitri's house, appeals to her to forget the past and <br />reunite as a couple. Savitri asks him to leave and when he does not <br />she asks the watchman to please ask him to get out. She then donates <br />her wealth to charity and Sridhar sees her marching on a yatra, <br />getting arrested. He joins the yatra himself, a reformed man.</p>
<p>That is the story in a nutshell. Like in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  it has some loose ends. <br />What about Chaaru, and Sastry? Sastry eventually comes to know Uma <br />Rani is Savitri but no mention of what happens to the child when she <br />and he join the freedom struggle. Perhaps she lives with Nallaan and <br />Ponni, perhaps her mother leaves her money, we don't really know.</acronym></p>
<p>That is the story, as it was written, how would it be if it was <br />written now, more on that tomorrow.</p>

<blockquote><p>  That was a great imagination. But the real punch in<br />  the story comes at<br />  the last when savitri giving all her money and<br />  joining the freedom<br />  struggle, without which the story would never<br />  achieved the glory it<br />  has today right??</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps...but then like I said before there is no<br />cause that equals the freedom struggle in modern<br />times. If you give all your money to the wrong cause<br />you are probably likely to file for bankruptcy and<br />have the world think of you as 'elichha vaayan' that<br />is all :))</p>
<p>Also another clarification, the number of girls being<br />cheated by NRI grooms has vastly reduced given<br />increase in communication/internet and more girls<br />leading educated, well informed lives. Second, I don't<br />intend this to be an NRI bashing session (I am an NRI<br />myself) - lots of girls are what they call wolly<br />headed, they want only money/big house/car/showy<br />things that come with marriage. Lots of girls also<br />fail to respect the culture that they come into which<br />is very different than indian culture but it is still<br />the land you live in and make money of off.</p>
<p>In Kalki's times we did not have the complexities of<br />cross cultural integration and women working as we do<br />now, but still helps to keep basic issues alive, that<br />is all.</p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  Something like that. I don't think the framework of the story is<br />  that important. What is more important is the issues that Kalki<br />  addressed and are still very much alive today - dowry, the quest for<br />  the 'fair, homely' girl with no respect for her courage or career<br />  goals, caste issues, and more than anything else, lack of a cause<br />  that unites people, like the freedom movement. Perhaps even by<br />  talking about these things we can increase awareness and do what we<br />  can do.</p></blockquote>
<p>That was a great imagination. But the real punch in the story comes at<br />the last when savitri giving all her money and joining the freedom<br />struggle, without which the story would never achieved the glory it<br />has today right??</p>

<p>Savitri perhaps moves in with father, has a child, starts working <br />again, climbs the corporate ladder and is soon CEO. She meets again <br />with Sridhar who has been deported for immigration fraud. She helps <br />him through court case out of pity and regard for her child's <br />father. Sridhar comes out of jail to see her successful, perhaps <br />running many charities in addition to her position, and feels sad <br />and resentful for what he did to her. He does not have courage to <br />face her again, he goes back to his native village that his parents <br />left many years ago in search for $ abroad and devotes his time and <br />money to running a school there.</p>
<p>Something like that. I don't think the framework of the story is <br />that important. What is more important is the issues that Kalki <br />addressed and are still very much alive today - dowry, the quest for <br />the 'fair, homely' girl with no respect for her courage or career <br />goals, caste issues, and more than anything else, lack of a cause <br />that unites people, like the freedom movement. Perhaps even by <br />talking about these things we can increase awareness and do what we <br />can do.</p>

The way the story<br <br />&gt; &gt; was...Sambu Sastry is an orthodox brahmin pundit/landowner who lives<br <br />&gt; &gt; in Nedungarai, a traditional village. Sastry is a widower and has<br <br />&gt; &gt; only daughter Savitri who is his everything. Savitri is a teenager<br <br />&gt; &gt; when the story begins and is at home assisting her father with his<br <br />&gt; &gt; daily poojas, taking care of cattle and cooking. Her father is<br <br />&gt; &gt; looking for a bridegroom for her. He is also a very progressive man<br <br />&gt; &gt; who is often seen visitng slum and being friends with Nallaan and<br <br />&gt; &gt; Ponni (Kalki's standard rural pair:)) which antagonises his<br <br />&gt; &gt; relationship with orthodox brahmin community.

The family demands very<br <br />&gt; &gt; high dowry which he pays by selling his property and without knowing<br <br />&gt; &gt; his daughter - Savitri despite being a village girl is<br <br />&gt; &gt; very 'thudukku' or outspoken and so he hides the dowry fact from<br <br />&gt; &gt; her. She is married and moves to Calcutta. Sridhar in the meantime<br <br />&gt; &gt; is having an affair with his secretary Susie who occasionally<br <br />&gt; &gt; dresses like a guy and comes home with him. She even comes to the<br <br />&gt; &gt; village with him for his marriage, dressed as a guy!! He repeatedly<br <br />&gt; &gt; taunts Savitri for her village upbringing (to this day this happens<br <br />&gt; &gt; in NRI marriages!!) . Meanwhile Sambu Sastry is attracted to Gandhian<br <br />&gt; &gt; ideals, sells whatever property he has left and joins the Mahatma's<br <br />&gt; &gt; cause. Savitri's in laws do not get any response for more money, so<br <br />&gt; &gt; one day they throw her out of the house. She is pregnant and in a<br <br />&gt; &gt; strange city not knowing language. Some kindly neighbors put her on<br <br />ets<br <br />&gt; &gt; some charity ride to Nedungarai hoping to see her dear father. The<br <br />&gt; &gt; house is locked, cows and property are sold, other than some curious<br <br />&gt; &gt; new neighbors nobody is there. Savitri now in advanced pregnancy<br <br />&gt; &gt; faints on the roadside and is taken to the general hospital.<br <br />&gt; &gt;<br <br />&gt; &gt; There she delivers a girl, Chaaru and leaves for Chennai in search<br <br />&gt; &gt; of her father, with the baby. She sees her father living in<br <br />&gt; &gt; a 'kuppam' with nallaan and ponni, and abandons the baby near them.<br <br />&gt; &gt; As she foresees her father takes the child and begins to raise her.<br <br />&gt; &gt; Savitri meanwhile works somewhere and attracts the attention of<br <br />&gt; &gt; another rich woman (who ultimately is her aunt). But the woman takes<br <br />&gt; &gt; her on as a guardian,educates her and leaves all her money to her<br <br />&gt; &gt; when she dies. She is now rich, educated Umaa Rani, drives aroundin<br <br />&gt; &gt; a car and speaks English. She asks Sastry and Charu to come and live<br <br />&gt; &gt; with her in her mansion (Sastry does not recognize his daughter<br <br />&gt; &gt; which is a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  of 'uruthhal' but perhaps she changed so much).<br <br />&gt; &gt; Sastry given to Gandhian ideals refuses but visits often with the<br <br />&gt; &gt; child who is very attached to Uma Rani's dog.<br <br />&gt; &gt;<br <br />&gt; &gt; Sridhar meanwhile mishandles some money in his office, his british<br <br />&gt; &gt; girl friend leaves him, his father dies and he becomes a fugitive<br <br />&gt; &gt; from the law. He is arrested one day and name appears in paper.<br <br />&gt; &gt; Savitri goes to police station and pays for his bail, he sees her<br <br />&gt; &gt; through jail bars and screams that she is his wife, and the<br <br />&gt; &gt; policeman uses his stick on him to shut up. When he is bailed outhe<br <br />&gt; &gt; goes to Savitri's house, appeals to her to forget the past and<br <br />&gt; &gt; reunite as a couple. Savitri asks him to leave and when he does not<br <br />&gt; &gt; she asks the watchman to please ask him to get out. She then donates<br <br />&gt; &gt; her wealth to charity and Sridhar sees her marching on a yatra,<br <br />&gt; &gt; getting arrested. He joins the yatra himself, a reformed man.<br <br />&gt; &gt;<br <br />&gt; &gt; That is the story in a nutshell.

Sastry eventually comes to know Uma<br <br />&gt; &gt; Rani is Savitri but no mention of what happens to the child when she<br <br />&gt; &gt; and he join the freedom struggle.

        <p>dear madam,<br />Thank you very much for the excellent narration of thyagabhoomi. You<br />have re told the story in a nutshell in most attractive manner. thank<br />you.

<p>    Kailasam, very good subject.</p>
<p>    Thyagabhoomi was one of Kalki's most inspiring works, it is a<br />    natural story of an orthodox brahmin family with the freedom<br />    struggle interwoven very appropriately. The way the story<br />    was...Sambu Sastry is an orthodox brahmin pundit/landowner who <br />lives<br />    in Nedungarai, a traditional village. Sastry is a widower and has<br />    only daughter Savitri who is his everything. Savitri is a teenager<br />    when the story begins and is at home assisting her father with his<br />    daily poojas, taking care of cattle and cooking. Her father is<br />    looking for a bridegroom for her. He is also a very progressive <br />man<br />    who is often seen visitng slum and being friends with Nallaan and<br />    Ponni (Kalki's standard rural pair:)) which antagonises his<br />    relationship with orthodox brahmin community. During a flood he<br />    opens his cattle shed and gives shelter to all slum dwellers and <br />the<br />    brahmins ex communicate him.</p>
<p>    There is a great dialogue in the cattle shed where cows talk about<br />    human beliefs and caste problems. I am red and you are black but <br />we<br />    are still cows why these humans are like this, perhaps you have<br />    horns, i have never seen a human with a horn they only behave like<br />    they have horns :)) Kalki deserves an award just for that one<br />    chapter :))</p>
<p>    Sastry eventually finds a groom in Calcutta for his daughter,<br />    Sridhar, an England returned handsome man. The family demands very<br />    high dowry which he pays by selling his property and without <br />knowing<br />    his daughter - Savitri despite being a village girl is<br />    very 'thudukku' or outspoken and so he hides the dowry fact from<br />    her. She is married and moves to Calcutta. Sridhar in the meantime<br />    is having an affair with his secretary Susie who occasionally<br />    dresses like a guy and comes home with him. She even comes to the<br />    village with him for his marriage, dressed as a guy!! He <br />repeatedly<br />    taunts Savitri for her village upbringing (to this day this <br />happens<br />    in NRI marriages!!). Meanwhile Sambu Sastry is attracted to <br />Gandhian<br />    ideals, sells whatever property he has left and joins the <br />Mahatma's<br />    cause. Savitri's in laws do not get any response for more money, <br />so<br />    one day they throw her out of the house. She is pregnant and in a<br />    strange city not knowing language. Some kindly neighbors put her <br />on</p></dmaloo@...></p></blockquote>
<p>gets</p>
<blockquote><p>    some charity ride to Nedungarai hoping to see her dear father. The<br />    house is locked, cows and property are sold, other than some <br />curious<br />    new neighbors nobody is there. Savitri now in advanced pregnancy<br />    faints on the roadside and is taken to the general hospital.</p>
<p>    There she delivers a girl, Chaaru and leaves for Chennai in search<br />    of her father, with the baby. She sees her father living in<br />    a 'kuppam' with nallaan and ponni, and abandons the baby near <br />them.<br />    As she foresees her father takes the child and begins to raise <br />her.<br />    Savitri meanwhile works somewhere and attracts the attention of<br />    another rich woman (who ultimately is her aunt). But the woman <br />takes<br />    her on as a guardian,educates her and leaves all her money to her<br />    when she dies. She is now rich, educated Umaa Rani, drives around <br />in<br />    a car and speaks English. She asks Sastry and Charu to come and <br />live<br />    with her in her mansion (Sastry does not recognize his daughter<br />    which is a bit of 'uruthhal' but perhaps she changed so much).<br />    Sastry given to Gandhian ideals refuses but visits often with the<br />    child who is very attached to Uma Rani's dog.</p>
<p>    Sridhar meanwhile mishandles some money in his office, his british<br />    girl friend leaves him, his father dies and he becomes a fugitive<br />    from the law. He is arrested one day and name appears in paper.<br />    Savitri goes to police station and pays for his bail, he sees her<br />    through jail bars and screams that she is his wife, and the<br />    policeman uses his stick on him to shut up. When he is bailed out <br />he<br />    goes to Savitri's house, appeals to her to forget the past and<br />    reunite as a couple. Savitri asks him to leave and when he does <br />not<br />    she asks the watchman to please ask him to get out. She then <br />donates<br />    her wealth to charity and Sridhar sees her marching on a yatra,<br />    getting arrested. He joins the yatra himself, a reformed man.</p>
<p>    That is the story in a nutshell. Like in PS it has some loose <br />ends.<br />    What about Chaaru, and Sastry? Sastry eventually comes to know Uma<br />    Rani is Savitri but no mention of what happens to the child when <br />she<br />    and he join the freedom struggle. Perhaps she lives with Nallaan <br />and<br />    Ponni, perhaps her mother leaves her money, we don't really know.</p>
<p>    That is the story, as it was written, how would it be if it was<br />    written now, more on that tomorrow.</p>

        <p>A really beautiful summary! I have always admired Kalki's naming of his<br />characters. Nallan,Ponni..incidentally Kamal Hassan used Nallan in Anbe<br />Sivam.<br />Ponni, these days, sounds too rural. BTW im naming a few of my projects<br />Ponni. Its such a pretty name.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Kailasam, very good subject.</p>
<p>  Thyagabhoomi was one of Kalki's most inspiring works, it is a<br />  natural story of an orthodox brahmin family with the freedom<br />  struggle interwoven very appropriately. The way the story<br />  was...Sambu Sastry is an orthodox brahmin pundit/landowner who lives<br />  in Nedungarai, a traditional village. Sastry is a widower and has<br />  only daughter Savitri who is his everything. Savitri is a teenager<br />  when the story begins and is at home assisting her father with his<br />  daily poojas, taking care of cattle and cooking. Her father is<br />  looking for a bridegroom for her. He is also a very progressive man<br />  who is often seen visitng slum and being friends with Nallaan and<br />  Ponni (Kalki's standard rural pair:)) which antagonises his<br />  relationship with orthodox brahmin community. During a flood he<br />  opens his cattle shed and gives shelter to all slum dwellers and the<br />  brahmins ex communicate him.</p>
<p>  There is a great dialogue in the cattle shed where cows talk about<br />  human beliefs and caste problems. I am red and you are black but we<br />  are still cows why these humans are like this, perhaps you have<br />  horns, i have never seen a human with a horn they only behave like<br />  they have horns :)) Kalki deserves an award just for that one<br />  chapter :))</p>
<p>  Sastry eventually finds a groom in Calcutta for his daughter,<br />  Sridhar, an England returned handsome man. The family demands very<br />  high dowry which he pays by selling his property and without knowing<br />  his daughter - Savitri despite being a village girl is<br />  very 'thudukku' or outspoken and so he hides the dowry fact from<br />  her. She is married and moves to Calcutta. Sridhar in the meantime<br />  is having an affair with his secretary Susie who occasionally<br />  dresses like a guy and comes home with him. She even comes to the<br />  village with him for his marriage, dressed as a guy!! He repeatedly<br />  taunts Savitri for her village upbringing (to this day this happens<br />  in NRI marriages!!). Meanwhile Sambu Sastry is attracted to Gandhian<br />  ideals, sells whatever property he has left and joins the Mahatma's<br />  cause. Savitri's in laws do not get any response for more money, so<br />  one day they throw her out of the house. She is pregnant and in a<br />  strange city not knowing language. Some kindly neighbors put her on<br />  some charity ride to Nedungarai hoping to see her dear father. The<br />  house is locked, cows and property are sold, other than some curious<br />  new neighbors nobody is there. Savitri now in advanced pregnancy<br />  faints on the roadside and is taken to the general hospital.</p>
<p>  There she delivers a girl, Chaaru and leaves for Chennai in search<br />  of her father, with the baby. She sees her father living in<br />  a 'kuppam' with nallaan and ponni, and abandons the baby near them.<br />  As she foresees her father takes the child and begins to raise her.<br />  Savitri meanwhile works somewhere and attracts the attention of<br />  another rich woman (who ultimately is her aunt). But the woman takes<br />  her on as a guardian,educates her and leaves all her money to her<br />  when she dies. She is now rich, educated Umaa Rani, drives around in<br />  a car and speaks English.

<p>  Sridhar meanwhile mishandles some money in his office, his british<br />  girl friend leaves him, his father dies and he becomes a fugitive<br />  from the law. He is arrested one day and name appears in paper.<br />  Savitri goes to police station and pays for his bail, he sees her<br />  through jail bars and screams that she is his wife, and the<br />  policeman uses his stick on him to shut up. When he is bailed out he<br />  goes to Savitri's house, appeals to her to forget the past and<br />  reunite as a couple. Savitri asks him to leave and when he does not<br />  she asks the watchman to please ask him to get out. She then donates<br />  her wealth to charity and Sridhar sees her marching on a yatra,<br />  getting arrested. He joins the yatra himself, a reformed man.</p>
<p>  That is the story in a nutshell. Like in PS it has some loose ends.<br />  What about Chaaru, and Sastry? Sastry eventually comes to know Uma<br />  Rani is Savitri but no mention of what happens to the child when she<br />  and he join the freedom struggle. Perhaps she lives with Nallaan and<br />  Ponni, perhaps her mother leaves her money, we don't really know.</p>
<p>  That is the story, as it was written, how would it be if it was<br />  written now, more on that tomorrow.</p>
