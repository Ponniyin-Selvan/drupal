<p>S.balasubramani B+ from Bhubaneswar Orissa</p>
<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p>Mathematics is the queen of subjects. Rightly so, then, Vedic Mathematics is the glowing crown that adorns its proud forehead. Very few of the masses today are aware today, of Vedic mathematics, the magnanimity of its profound implications, and of its origins which guided the rest of the world towards purer and more intricate branches of mathematics and which, laid the foundations for number theory and arithmetic, the teeny-weeny part of which we are taught during our alma-mater days with hardly any reference made to its rightful owners ? our very own ancestors ?who pursued the study of mathematics with no less finesse than that of a fine art.</p>
<p>A well-known fact it is, as every one knows now, for he/she has seen himself/herself or his friend, being answered by his teacher, during the primary years of his education, in response to his/her query full of childish criticism &#147;What has India given to Mathematics? that the numeral 0 was indeed the creation of Indian mathematicians. Introduction of zero brought about a new revolution into the world of mathematics. </p>
<p>It was zero that gave rise to the idea of representing numbers using base 10, as it is commonly used today. And it is zero because of which you are able to read this article. But why? How would a computer work without zeros and ones!!! So that&#146;s the zero there, right!</p>
<p>Though the Arabs are given the credit of taking mathematics into broader frontiers, they had begun their work with the help of Indian manuscripts. </p>
<p>The story goes something like this. It was in 773 that the Arabs were able to set their eyes on the astounding developments of numerical methods Indians used when one of the Indian palmist and fortune-teller happened to visit the Arabian lands. So impressed were the Arab mathematicians with Indian inventions that the Arab mathematician Muhammed-Ibna-Musa-Abu-Jafar-Al-Khwarizmi himself came to India to study Indian mathematics. After stating here for some time after learning the subjects to his satisfaction, he wrote his manuscript &#147;Algebra &#146;&#150;b-e-Mukabla? This is how &#145;Algebra?was born. His works, which were nothing but a translation of his Indian studies, left the European mathematicians spell-bound, especially by the use of base 10 to represent numbers. The idea of representing numbers by base 10, is thus, originally Indian.</p>
<p>In this article, we take a glimpse of the very fantastic inventions of Vedic mathematics in the field of number theory and arithmetic. Though cited here are examples of the methods described in Vedas , Vedic mathematics has its frontiers expanding into many more diverse areas and concepts like astrology, astronomy, geometry, trigonometry, to name a few. The examples<br />cited here would be useful in performing calculations that you may be coming across everyday. This article would be of course, a welcome change to those who complain that they hardly get time to stretch their legs during those interminably tightly timed aptitude tests! I will like to share some experts of a Book called "DrutGanit"(Speed mathematics) by Mr. Shyam Marathe.... The book is in Marathi discussing the techniques of doing mathematical operation of big numbers very quickly using the techniques present in "Vedas" .... </p>
<p>---------------------------------<br />Examples: We shall start with a method to multiply 2 numbers. It will reveal to you how innovative Vedic mathematics can be.</p>
<p>Lets deal, to begin with, with numbers that are close to POWERS of 10 i.e. numbers near to 10, 100, 1000, etc.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Say, we have to multiply 98 and 97.<br />(First, try using conventional method and find out how much time it takes!)</p>
<p>Now we go for the Vedic method.<br />Write down the numbers in this manner:</p>
<p>98 -2<br />97 -3</p>
<p>In the above representation, -2 and &#150;3 stand for the difference of 98 and 97 from 100. We may call these differences &#150;2 and &#150;3 as OFFSETS of 98 and 97 from 100. We may call 100 as the &#145;BASE&#146; as differences are taken from 100.</p>
<p>Step 1) First, we multiply the offsets &#150;2 and &#150;3<br />We get 6.<br />Since our base is 100, which has 2 zeros, the product of offsets must also have 2 digits. Hence we write 6 as 06 and write it down as last 2 digits of our answer.</p>
<p>98 -2<br />97 &#150;3<br />-------------------------<br />06</p>
<p>Step 2) Now for the previous digits, just add any 2 numbers in the above figure crosswise i.e. either (98-3) or (97-2)<br />We get 95. This is written before 06 as follows: -</p>
<p>98 -2<br />97 &#150;3<br />---------------------------<br />95 / 06</p>
<p>That gives us 9506. That&#146;s our answer.<br />Hence 98 x 97 = 9506</p>
<p>Aint it simple!!<br />Example 2:<br />Once again, we solve 25 x 98.</p>
<p>25 -75<br />98 -2<br />---------------------------<br />Here, once again, our base is 100. -75 and &#150;2 are offsets of 25 and 98 from 100.</p>
<p>Step 1) -75 x &#150;2 gives 150</p>
<p>Since our base (100) has 2 zeros, the product of offsets must have 2 digits. Hence we write down last 2 digits of 150 i.e. 50 as last 2 digits of our answer. 1 would be treated as carry.</p>
<p>25 -75<br />98 -2<br />---------------------------<br />50 ( 1 carry )</p>
<p>Step 2) Add the numbers crosswise. i.e. ( 25-2 ) or ( 98 &#150; 75 ).<br />We get 23.<br />Add the carry from previous step.<br />We get 23 + 1 = 24<br />These are written as first 2 digits of our answer.</p>
<p>25 -75<br />98 -2<br />---------------------------<br />(23+1) / 50</p>
<p>i.e.<br />25 -75<br />98 -2<br />---------------------------<br />24 / 50</p>
<p>Answer: 25 x 98 = 2450</p>
<p>Example 3:<br />Now, lets try for 108 x 109</p>
<p>Let us write down the numbers as:</p>
<p>108 8<br />109 9<br />---------------------------<br />and carry out the same method as above.</p>
<p>Note that 8 and 9 are offsets of 108 and 109 from base 100.</p>
<p>Step 1) Product of offsets 8 x 9 = 72<br />Write down 72 as last digits of our answer.</p>
<p>108 8<br />109 9<br />--------------------------<br />72<br />Step 2) Add any 2 numbers cross wise ( 108 + 9 ) or ( 109 + 8 )<br />We get 108 + 9 = 117<br />These are the front digits of the answer.</p>
<p>108 8<br />109 9<br />---------------------------<br />117 / 72</p>
<p>Hence 108 x 109 = 11772</p>
<p>Example 4:</p>
<p>Lets try 98 x 104.</p>
<p>98 -2<br />104 4<br />---------------------------</p>
<p>Step 1 ) Product of offsets &#150;2 x 4 = -8<br />We write it down as,<br />98 -2<br />104 4<br />---------------------------<br />-8</p>
<p>Step 2 ) Now, 98 + 4 or 104 &#150;2 gives 102.<br />These are the earlier digits of our answer.</p>
<p>98 -2<br />104 4<br />---------------------------<br />102 / -8</p>
<p>Step 3) Since the number after &#147;/ &#148; is as negative number we have to<br />decrease the number to the left of &#147;/&#148; by 1 ( i.e. 102 becomes 101 ). Next, the number 8 (which has a negative sign) has to be deducted from the number base times 1 i.e. deduct 8 from 100 x 1.<br />i.e. 100 &#150; 8 = 92<br />92 is written in the place of &#150;8. That makes our result as: -</p>
<p>98 -2<br />104 4<br />--------------------------<br />101 / 92</p>
<p>Hence 104 x 98 = 10192.</p>
<p>Lets see how it simplifies our calculation for huge numbers:</p>
<p>Example 5:</p>
<p>Multiply 888 by 998: -</p>
<p>888 -112<br />998 -002<br />---------------------------<br />886 / 224</p>
<p>Here, the base is 1000 i.e. offsets are differences from 1000</p>
<p>-112 x &#150; 002 = 224 ( Simple enough )</p>
<p>And 888 &#150; 002 = 886</p>
<p>Hence, 888 x 998 = 886224.<br />Example 6:</p>
<p>Multiply 9997 by 9998:-</p>
<p>9997 -3 ( base 10,000 )<br />9998 -2<br />------------------------------<br />9997 &#150; 2 ) / 0006</p>
<p>( Here, base is 10,000, which has 4 zeros. Hence the product of offsets <br />&#150;2<br />and &#150;3 is padded with zeros to make it a 4-digit number )</p>
<p>Hence,</p>
<p>9997 -3<br />9998 -2<br />------------------------------<br />9995 / 0006 = 99950006 (Answer!!!)</p>
<p>Example 7:</p>
<p>Multiply 999979 by 999998: -</p>
<p>999979 -21 (base 1,00,000)<br />999998 -2<br />--------------------------------<br />( 999979 &#150; 2 ) / 000042</p>
<p>Here, -21 x &#150;2 = 42.<br />Base has 6 zeros. Hence pad 42 with 4 zeros to make 000042.<br />Then, 999979 &#150; 2 = 999977. Those are the earlier digits of our answer.</p>
<p>999979 -21<br />999998 -2<br />------------------------------<br />999977 / 000042</p>
<p>Hence, 999979 x 999998 = 999977000042.</p>
<p>Ever wondered multiplying such big numbers could be that simple!!!</p>
<p>The methods discussed above are extremely effective for multiplying numbers near the powers of 10. Similar methods can be applied to find the product of ANY 2 numbers (irrespective of whether they are near powers of 10) using ANY MULTIPLE of 10 as base.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />Ancient India produced some of the most fascinating series of debates on what constitutes the "scientific method": How does one separate our sensory perceptions from dreams and hallucinations? When should an observation of reality be taken as scientific truth? How should the principles of inductive and deductive logic be developed and applied? How does one evaluate a hypothesis for its scientific merit? What is a valid inference? What constitutes scientific proof? <br />These and other questions were attacked with an unexpected intellectual vigor. As keen observers of nature and the human body, ancient India's scientists studied human sensory organs, analyzed dreams, memory and consciousness. They understood dialectics in nature; they understood change, both in quantitative and qualitative terms; they even posited a prototype of the modern atomic theory. And several of their dissertations and commentaries could hold their own even today.<br />For the Hindutvadis, this would be proof positive that ancient India, particularly "Hindu India" represented a high point - if not the very zenith - of world civilization! They might even add to the list: that Indian astronomers were the first to describe the earth as a sphere and prove that it was the earth that rotated around the sun (long before the Europeans), that they were also the first to correctly model both solar and lunar eclipses. <br />They could say that differential equations, the basis of modern calculus, were in all likelihood an Indian invention, something essential in modeling planetary motions. They could point to Indian mathematicians as being the first to invent the concept of infinite numbers, numbers that can only be represented through abstract mathematical formulations such as infinite series, geometric or arithmetic. They could claim that Indian mathematicians were familiar with polynomial equations (again essential in advanced astronomy) long before the Western world, and were the inventors of the modern numeral system (wrongly) referred to as the Arabic numeral system in Europe. They could assert that Indians were the first to study grammar and syntax. <br />And on this basis they could argue that Islam delivered a death blow to "Hindu civilization." But there are several flaws with this theory. <br />Science: consequence of heightened dialectics<br />First, most of the treatises expounding on scientific method arose as a by-product of intense polemics between advocates of Vedic idealism and a variety of heterodox challenges to Vedic supremacy and ideological hegemony. <br />One school of Vedic idealism believed that there was complete separation between mind and body, and that all sensory perception was illusory i.e. "maya", and the liberation of the soul, i.e. "moksha", was the only thing that mattered. According to them, all debates on science and rationality were irrelevant, for they dealt with a world they considered an "illusion" - a world that was but a diversion from the path to "eternal liberation."<br />A less idealistic school of Vedic scholars called for unquestioning allegiance to scripture, believing in the infallibility of the Vedas and Upanishads, and thinking all knowledge to be contained within them. For them too, all scientific debate was irrelevant because anything not included in the Vedas was either false or unimportant. Left to themselves, such Vedic scholars were hardly likely to advance the cause of Indian science<br />Scientific investigation advanced in ancient India precisely because orthodoxy was not allowed to prevail. The practice of logic was perfected through fierce polemics between representatives of the many heterodox streams that struggled with Vedic Hindu scholars, such as the Lokayatas, the Tantrics, the Jainas and the Buddhists, amongst others. They argued for taking the real world seriously, and mocked the hypocrisy of the Vedic scholars who on the one hand ridiculed the real world, and on the other conducted all manner of sacrifices and ceremonies ('havans') to bring health and prosperity to their patrons and themselves. Much of the early impetus for scientific thinking in India thus came from outside Vedic Hinduism, not within.<br />When Hindu rule made a comeback after defeating Buddhism, Vedic idealism did not return in its old form. Confronted and exposed by the earthy common-sense of its opponents, Vedic idealism had to make some sort of peace with functional realism.</p>
<p>Elements of rationality and common sense entered into the Hindu consciousness. Although the most radical of the heterodox challenges to Hinduism were extinguished, other heterodox streams got absorbed into a broader and hence, "more tolerant" reincarnation of Hinduism. At this time, Hinduism was not entirely averse to scientific investigation and even encouraged it. Astronomy and its applications to weather-forecasting became an important subject for Brahmins whose social status depended on how well they advised the peasants on when and what to sow. <br />But even during these best of times, the scientific spirit never penetrated very deep in India. It is worthwhile to note how Al Biruni (the renowned Arab scholar of the middle ages) describes India as being an unbelievable paradox: where the most brilliant scientific minds co-exist with a society that turns the most profound scientific theory and invention into absurd myths about gods and supernatural creatures, creating magical phenomenon to reward and punish the masses. Al Biruni, who was a product of Islam in its most progressive period, when the memory of fighting irrational customs and superstitious beliefs was still fresh and alive, was naturally baffled by this contradiction.</p>
<p>Islam: Vehicle of international trade and exchange of ideas<br />Having fought idol worship and empty rituals of sacrifice and cleansing in the Arab peninsula, Islam was not exactly unsuited to shaking up the sub-continent. Notwithstanding the tremendous achievements of pre-Islamic India, there is little evidence that pre-Islamic India was at par in the realm of experimental and applied physics. Here, the Greeks and the Chinese were far advanced. And what Islam provided, before and after the 10th century, was a powerful vehicle for the international flow of ideas and products.</p>
<p>Just as Buddhism had taken the intellectual advances of the sub-continent and spread them eastwards, Islam in its early phase spread the intellectual knowledge of India and China westwards. The Arabs integrated the knowledge of the East with the knowledge of the Ancient Greeks and Babylonians, adding and elaborating on what was already known.<br />In the second phase of Islam (from the 12th century on), India became a beneficiary of this process, and technologies from Iraq and Iran, from China and Central Asia were absorbed and assimilated into the sub-continent. By the 13th century, India had become one evance diminished as reliance on the rains for irrigation decreased. <br />With growth in agricultural production came increased tax revenue which financed the construction of monumental state buildings and increased the consumption of manufactured goods. Advances like the spinning-wheel created opportunities for expanding the textile industry, leading to new requirements for tailors, weavers, dyers and embroiders. Innovations also took place in metallurgy and glass production. All of this augmented the demand for construction and manufacturing labor.<br />New urban centers came up around specialized manufacturing sites, with conversions to Islam taking place to ease the shortage of labor in new job categories. Such conversions often came with the undying loyalty of the converted since this alternative work liberated formerly low-caste Hindus from highly demeaning and poorly remunerated work. <br />Mobility also came through the army where soldiers were recruited from all castes and promotions were not restricted to specific castes. Exceptional performance in the battlefield could permit a low-caste Hindu to rise up to the ranks of a battalion commander or even a general.<br />In contrast, much of Hindu-ruled society, had become repressive and stagnant. In several regions, caste rule had become rigid and parasitical, and the masses had little incentive to save these moribund societies from the advent of Islam. This is not to say that Islam did not destroy or take away much of what may have still been culturally vibrant, or that Islam wasn't equally repressive in it's own way, but rather that Hinduism had, by and large, reached a certain plateau and the conflict with Islam would eventually yield a more fecund and advanced society.</p>
<p>That even some popular Hindu kingdoms got swept away in the cauldron of Islamic conquests is unfortunate collateral damage that came with the general collapse of Hindu rule. But it wasn't military prowess that sustained Islam. Islam, as it spread along the Silk route, was to be the vehicle to bring new ideas to the sub-continent. China, Persia and the Arab world were developing new technologies that would soon find their way into India. And this was to be Islam's primary contribution to India</p>
<p>Dividing the mental from the physical<br />One of the reasons that Hindu society, even as it was able to foster and develop abstract and speculative thinking, failed to understand the potential of experimental and applied physics and bring about technological innovation. was because of its tendency to separating the mental from physical. The more influence Brahmins acquired in society, the more detached they became from the working masses, from skilled craftspeople and artisans. </p>
<p>This separation between mental and physical work meant that no caste could take up the work of experimental physics. The Brahmins couldn't conduct the experiments because it meant handling all kinds of "impure" materials and the working castes simply weren't educated enough so lacked the scientific and logical training to allow them to study physics and use it to develop new technologies and build new tools.<br />Precisely for this reason, Brahminical India had a poor record in inventing labor saving technologies. The elaborate caste system made it too easy to dump all the dirty work on someone else.<br />Societies that are socially conservative have rarely displayed an understanding of physics and its power to change the world. That is why India needed Buddhism and Islam, and later Sikhism, to challenge the ossifying tendencies that are inherent in conservative Hinduism.<br />For several centuries Christianity too, was extremely conservative and ridden with superstition and false belief. In such an environment science couldn't flourish, and Europe went through its long dark ages. But mounting social challenges to Christianity and the growth of rational thinkers meant that by the middle of the 15th century (if not earlier), Europe was awakening from its slumber. The scientific advances of the Arab world were assimilated and enhanced by the Europeans. By the end of the 18th century the Western ascent had begun.</p>
<p>Science and Technology in Modern India<br />Today we can see how India, as the world's first nation to understand planetary motion in all its complexity, has emerged as a leading nation in space technology. We can see how the first nation to speculate about atomic particles has made advances in nuclear technology. We can see the ancient mathematical genius manifest itself in computer programming.</p>
<p>But we also see how India imports most of the hardware required in the computer industry, how it imports whole assembly lines and advanced machine-tools. This nation can launch its own satellites, but cannot improve something more mundane, like a car or bus engine. We see how one of the hottest countries in the world can't innovate on appliances like air-conditioners and refrigerators. We need to beg the Americans and the Japanese to bring us the latest technology for these devices.</p>
<p>One of the reasons this has happened is that India's leading industrialists like the Tatas and Birlas were allowed to function in a caste-like uncompetitive environment. With the License Raj allowing big industrial houses to ward off competitors, liberal rates of profit were virtually guaranteed.<br />Industrial monopolists could thrive without intellectual or entrepreneurial effort. Like the Brahmins of yester-years, the captains of industry along with their cohorts in the bureaucracy, became detached and distant from the masses of the country. Technological stagnation was an inevitable consequence.<br />Yet, this was not always the case with the Indian entrepreneurs. Consider how in the 18th century the Wadias of Bombay were producing ships as fine as any British vessel. Indian entrepreneurs of that period had fortunes comparable to their European counterparts.<br />Consider this following quote: "According to certain travelers, Surat was then the most beautiful city of India. One small detail will give an idea of the unparalleled luxury that prevailed there: certain streets were paved with porcelain. Francois Martin in his Memoires calls it 'a real Babylon.''' <br />But once British rule established itself, the entrepreneurs of that age were wiped out. The new class of Indian industrialists that emerged during British rule were the "gomostahs," i.e. the go-betweens that assisted the British in procuring cheap raw materials from the country and offered to market British-made goods in the country. A few dozen of them (like the Tatas and Birlas) were permitted to set up small ancillary industries that complemented British industry and served the needs of the British empire in India. Given this origin, it isn't difficult to see why many of India's post-independence industrialists had a hard time overcoming the tendency to remain as "gomostahs" and traders. The trader isn't particularly concerned about value-addition as long as there is quick profit to be made through buying and selling. </p>

          vedic Mathematics        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>hmmm, interesting. Recently I bought a couple of vedic mathematics CDs and<br />books from 'Motilal banarasidas' here in mylapore for two of my cousins in<br />high and middle school. But I find it regretful that the parents do not<br />realize the worth or try to kindle interest in thier children on vedic<br />mathematics. They instead spend a lot of money in abacus classes. Could it<br />be because they would like some organized classes so that they can simply<br />delegate the work of teaching thier children to others? Its also notable<br />that when we have at least two abacus coaching centers in the area where I<br />live, there is nobody I know in the whole of Chennai to teach vedic<br />mathematics. hmmmm, maybe we should do something about this?!</p>

<p>  * *Mathematics is the queen of subjects. Rightly so, then, Vedic<br />  Mathematics is the glowing crown that adorns its proud forehead. Very fewof<br />  the masses today are aware today, of Vedic mathematics, the magnanimity of<br />  its profound implications, and of its origins which guided the rest of the<br />  world towards purer and more intricate branches of mathematics and which,<br />  laid the foundations for number theory and arithmetic, the teeny-weeny part<br />  of which we are taught during our alma-mater days with hardly any reference<br />  made to its rightful owners ? our very own ancestors ?who pursued the study<br />  of mathematics with no less finesse than that of a fine art.*<br />  **<br />  *A well-known fact it is, as every one knows now, for he/she has seen<br />  himself/herself or his friend, being answered by his teacher, during the<br />  primary years of his education, in response to his/her query full of<br />  childish criticism "What has India given to Mathematics? that the numeral0<br />  was indeed the creation of Indian mathematicians. Introduction of zero<br />  brought about a new revolution into the world of mathematics. *<br />  **<br />  *It was zero that gave rise to the idea of representing numbers using base<br />  10, as it is commonly used today. And it is zero because of which you are<br />  able to read this article. But why? How would a computer work without zeros<br />  and ones!!! So that's the zero there, right!</p>
<p>  Though the Arabs are given the credit of taking mathematics into broader<br />  frontiers, they had begun their work with the help of Indian manuscripts.<br />  *<br />  **<br />  *The story goes something like this. It was in 773 that the Arabs were<br />  able to set their eyes on the astounding developments of numerical methods<br />  Indians used when one of the Indian palmist and fortune-teller happened to<br />  visit the Arabian lands. So impressed were the Arab mathematicians with<br />  Indian inventions that the Arab mathematician<br />  Muhammed-Ibna-Musa-Abu-Jafar-Al-Khwarizmi himself came to India to study<br />  Indian mathematics. After stating here for some time after learning the<br />  subjects to his satisfaction, he wrote his manuscript "Algebra<br />  '?b-e-Mukabla? This is how 'Algebra?was born. His works, which were nothing<br />  but a translation of his Indian studies, left the European mathematicians<br />  spell-bound, especially by the use of base 10 to represent numbers. The idea<br />  of representing numbers by base 10, is thus, originally Indian.*<br />  *<br />  from Spain to Europe. Europeans however, initially reluctant to use base 10<br />  to represent numbers, inevitably began to use it in 1202 (during the timeof<br />  Bhaskaracharya). Though the mathematical works went on improving as it<br />  changed hands, the world availed the first systematically documented use of<br />  base 10 only in Bhaskaracharya's manuscript "Lilavati? 4th century<br />  mathematician Diaphantus, who is also known as 'Father of Arithmetic? has<br />  his works in his book 'Arithmetica?coinciding closely with the Indian<br />  manuscripts of earlier age. These are but a few evidences that arithmetic<br />  and basic mathematics that has evolved today in various forms, is but the<br />  creation of those great olden Indian minds.*<br />  *In this article, we take a glimpse of the very fantastic inventions of<br />  Vedic mathematics in the field of number theory and arithmetic. Though cited<br />  here are examples of the methods described in Vedas , Vedic mathematics has<br />  its frontiers expanding into many more diverse areas and concepts like<br />  astrology, astronomy, geometry, trigonometry, to name a few. The examples<br />  cited here would be useful in performing calculations that you may be<br />  coming across everyday. This article would be of course, a welcome changeto<br />  those who complain that they hardly get time to stretch their legs during<br />  those interminably tightly timed aptitude tests! I will like to share some<br />  experts of a Book called "DrutGanit"(Speed mathematics) by Mr. Shyam<br />  Marathe.... The book is in Marathi discussing the techniques of doing<br />  mathematical operation of big numbers very quickly using the techniques<br />  present in "Vedas" .... *<br />  *<br />  ------------------------------<br />  * Examples: *We shall start with a method to multiply 2 numbers. It will<br />  reveal to you how innovative Vedic mathematics can be.</p>
<p>  Lets deal, to begin with, with numbers that are close to POWERS of 10 i.e.<br />  numbers near to 10, 100, 1000, etc.</p>
<p>  Example 1:</p>
<p>  Say, we have to multiply 98 and 97.<br />  (First, try using conventional method and find out how much time it<br />  takes!)</p>
<p>  Now we go for the Vedic method.<br />  Write down the numbers in this manner:</p>
<p>  98 -2<br />  97 -3</p>
<p>  In the above representation, -2 and ?3 stand for the difference of 98 and<br />  97 from 100. We may call these differences ?2 and ?3 as OFFSETS of 98and 97<br />  from 100. We may call 100 as the 'BASE' as differences are taken from 100.</p>
<p>  Step 1) First, we multiply the offsets ?2 and ?3<br />  We get 6.<br />  Since our base is 100, which has 2 zeros, the product of offsets must also<br />  have 2 digits. Hence we write 6 as 06 and write it down as last 2 digits of<br />  our answer.</p>
<p>  98 -2<br />  97 ?3<br />  -------------------------<br />  06</p>
<p>  Step 2) Now for the previous digits, just add any 2 numbers in the above<br />  figure crosswise i.e. either (98-3) or (97-2)<br />  We get 95. This is written before 06 as follows: -</p>
<p>  98 -2<br />  97 ?3<br />  ---------------------------<br />  95 / 06</p>
<p>  That gives us 9506. That's our answer.<br />  Hence 98 x 97 = 9506</p>
<p>  Aint it simple!!<br />  Example 2:<br />  Once again, we solve 25 x 98.</p>
<p>  25 -75<br />  98 -2<br />  ---------------------------<br />  Here, once again, our base is 100. -75 and ?2 are offsets of 25 and 98<br />  from 100.</p>
<p>  Step 1) -75 x ?2 gives 150</p>
<p>  Since our base (100) has 2 zeros, the product of offsets must have 2<br />  digits. Hence we write down last 2 digits of 150 i.e. 50 as last 2 digits<br />  of our answer. 1 would be treated as carry.</p>
<p>  25 -75<br />  98 -2<br />  ---------------------------<br />  50 ( 1 carry )</p>
<p>  Step 2) Add the numbers crosswise. i.e. ( 25-2 ) or ( 98 ? 75 ).<br />  We get 23.<br />  Add the carry from previous step.<br />  We get 23 + 1 = 24<br />  These are written as first 2 digits of our answer.</p>
<p>  25 -75<br />  98 -2<br />  ---------------------------<br />  (23+1) / 50</p>
<p>  i.e.<br />  25 -75<br />  98 -2<br />  ---------------------------<br />  24 / 50</p>
<p>  Answer: 25 x 98 = 2450</p>
<p>  Example 3:<br />  Now, lets try for 108 x 109</p>
<p>  Let us write down the numbers as:</p>
<p>  108 8<br />  109 9<br />  ---------------------------<br />  and carry out the same method as above.</p>
<p>  Note that 8 and 9 are offsets of 108 and 109 from base 100.</p>
<p>  Step 1) Product of offsets 8 x 9 = 72<br />  Write down 72 as last digits of our answer.</p>
<p>  108 8<br />  109 9<br />  --------------------------<br />  72<br />  Step 2) Add any 2 numbers cross wise ( 108 + 9 ) or ( 109 + 8 )<br />  We get 108 + 9 = 117<br />  These are the front digits of the answer.</p>
<p>  108 8<br />  109 9<br />  ---------------------------<br />  117 / 72</p>
<p>  Hence 108 x 109 = 11772</p>
<p>  Example 4:</p>
<p>  Lets try 98 x 104.</p>
<p>  98 -2<br />  104 4<br />  ---------------------------</p>
<p>  Step 1 ) Product of offsets ?2 x 4 = -8<br />  We write it down as,<br />  98 -2<br />  104 4<br />  ---------------------------<br />  -8</p>
<p>  Step 2 ) Now, 98 + 4 or 104 ?2 gives 102.<br />  These are the earlier digits of our answer.</p>
<p>  98 -2<br />  104 4<br />  ---------------------------<br />  102 / -8</p>
<p>  Step 3) Since the number after "/ " is as negative number we have to<br />  decrease the number to the left of "/" by 1 ( i.e. 102 becomes 101 ).<br />  Next, the number 8 (which has a negative sign) has to be deducted from the<br />  number base times 1 i.e. deduct 8 from 100 x 1.<br />  i.e. 100 ? 8 = 92<br />  92 is written in the place of ?8. That makes our result as: -</p>
<p>  98 -2<br />  104 4<br />  --------------------------<br />  101 / 92</p>
<p>  Hence 104 x 98 = 10192.</p>
<p>  Lets see how it simplifies our calculation for huge numbers:</p>
<p>  Example 5:</p>
<p>  Multiply 888 by 998: -</p>
<p>  888 -112<br />  998 -002<br />  ---------------------------<br />  886 / 224</p>
<p>  Here, the base is 1000 i.e. offsets are differences from 1000</p>
<p>  -112 x ? 002 = 224 ( Simple enough )</p>
<p>  And 888 ? 002 = 886</p>
<p>  Hence, 888 x 998 = 886224.<br />  Example 6:</p>
<p>  Multiply 9997 by 9998:-</p>
<p>  9997 -3 ( base 10,000 )<br />  9998 -2<br />  ------------------------------<br />  9997 ? 2 ) / 0006</p>
<p>  ( Here, base is 10,000, which has 4 zeros. Hence the product of offsets<br />  ?2<br />  and ?3 is padded with zeros to make it a 4-digit number )</p>
<p>  Hence,</p>
<p>  9997 -3<br />  9998 -2<br />  ------------------------------<br />  9995 / 0006 = 99950006 (Answer!!!)</p>
<p>  Example 7:</p>
<p>  Multiply 999979 by 999998: -</p>
<p>  999979 -21 (base 1,00,000)<br />  999998 -2<br />  --------------------------------<br />  ( 999979 ? 2 ) / 000042</p>
<p>  Here, -21 x ?2 = 42.<br />  Base has 6 zeros. Hence pad 42 with 4 zeros to make 000042.<br />  Then, 999979 ? 2 = 999977. Those are the earlier digits of our answer.</p>
<p>  999979 -21<br />  999998 -2<br />  ------------------------------<br />  999977 / 000042</p>
<p>  Hence, 999979 x 999998 = 999977000042.</p>
<p>  Ever wondered multiplying such big numbers could be that simple!!!</p>
<p>  The methods discussed above are extremely effective for multiplying<br />  numbers near the powers of 10. Similar methods can be applied to find the<br />  product of ANY 2 numbers (irrespective of whether they are near powers of<br />  10) using ANY MULTIPLE of 10 as base.*<br />  **<br />  **<br />  * &amp;n<br />  bsp; *<br />  *Ancient India produced some of the most fascinating series of debates on<br />  what constitutes the "scientific method": How does one separate our sensory<br />  perceptions from dreams and hallucinations? When should an observation of<br />  reality be taken as scientific truth? How should the principles of inductive<br />  and deductive logic be developed and applied? How does one evaluate a<br />  hypothesis for its scientific merit? What is a valid inference? What<br />  constitutes scientific proof? *<br />  *These and other questions were attacked with an unexpected intellectual<br />  vigor. As keen observers of nature and the human body, ancient India's<br />  scientists studied human sensory organs, analyzed dreams, memory and<br />  consciousness. They understood dialectics in nature; they understood change,<br />  both in quantitative and qualitative terms; they even posited a prototypeof<br />  the modern atomic theory. And several of their dissertations and<br />  commentaries could hold their own even today.*<br />  *For the Hindutvadis, this would be proof positive that ancient India,<br />  particularly "Hindu India" represented a high point - if not the very zenith<br />  - of world civilization! They might even add to the list: that Indian<br />  astronomers were the first to describe the earth as a sphere and prove that<br />  it was the earth that rotated around the sun (long before the Europeans),<br />  that they were also the first to correctly model both solar and lunar<br />  eclipses. *<br />  *They could say that differential equations, the basis of modern calculus,<br />  were in all likelihood an Indian invention, something essential in modeling<br />  planetary motions. They could point to Indian mathematicians as being the<br />  first to invent the concept of infinite numbers, numbers that can only be<br />  represented through abstract mathematical formulations such as infinite<br />  series, geometric or arithmetic. They could claim that Indian mathematicians<br />  were familiar with polynomial equations (again essential in advanced<br />  astronomy) long before the Western world, and were the inventors of the<br />  modern numeral system (wrongly) referred to as the Arabic numeral system in<br />  Europe. They could assert that Indians were the first to study grammar and<br />  syntax. *<br />  *And on this basis they could argue that Islam delivered a death blow to<br />  "Hindu civilization." But there are several flaws with this theory. *<br />  *Science: consequence of heightened dialectics*<br />  *First, most of the treatises expounding on scientific method arose as a<br />  by-product of intense polemics between advocates of Vedic idealism and a<br />  variety of heterodox challenges to Vedic supremacy and ideological hegemony.<br />  *<br />  *One school of Vedic idealism believed that there was complete separation<br />  between mind and body, and that all sensory perception was illusory i.e.<br />  "maya", and the liberation of the soul, i.e. "moksha", was the only thing<br />  that mattered. According to them, all debates on science and rationality<br />  were irrelevant, for they dealt with a world they considered an "illusion" -<br />  a world that was but a diversion from the path to "eternal liberation."*<br />  *A less idealistic school of Vedic scholars called for unquestioning<br />  allegiance to scripture, believing in the infallibility of the Vedas and<br />  Upanishads, and thinking all knowledge to be contained within them. For them<br />  too, all scientific debate was irrelevant because anything not included in<br />  the Vedas was either false or unimportant. Left to themselves, such Vedic<br />  scholars were hardly likely to advance the cause of Indian science*<br />  *Scientific investigation advanced in ancient India precisely because<br />  orthodoxy was not allowed to prevail. The practice of logic was perfected<br />  through fierce polemics between representatives of the many heterodox<br />  streams that struggled with Vedic Hindu scholars, such as the Lokayatas, the<br />  Tantrics, the Jainas and the Buddhists, amongst others. They argued for<br />  taking the real world seriously, and mocked the hypocrisy of the Vedic<br />  scholars who on the one hand ridiculed the real world, and on the other<br />  conducted all manner of sacrifices and ceremonies ('havans') to bring health<br />  and prosperity to their patrons and themselves. Much of the early impetus<br />  for scientific thinking in India thus came from outside Vedic Hinduism, not<br />  within.*<br />  *When Hindu rule made a comeback after defeating Buddhism, Vedic idealism<br />  did not return in its old form. Confronted and exposed by the earthy<br />  common-sense of its opponents, Vedic idealism had to make some sort of peace<br />  with functional realism.*<br />  **<br />  * Elements of rationality and common sense entered into the Hindu<br />  consciousness. Although the most radical of the heterodox challenges to<br />  Hinduism were extinguished, other heterodox streams got absorbed into a<br />  broader and hence, "more tolerant" reincarnation of Hinduism. At this time,<br />  Hinduism was not entirely averse to scientific investigation and even<br />  encouraged it. Astronomy and its applications to weather-forecasting became<br />  an important subject for Brahmins whose social status depended on how well<br />  they advised the peasants on when and what to sow. *<br />  *But even during these best of times, the scientific spirit never<br />  penetrated very deep in India. It is worthwhile to note how Al Biruni (the<br />  renowned Arab scholar of the middle ages) describes India as being an<br />  unbelievable paradox: where the most brilliant scientific minds co-exist<br />  with a society that turns the most profound scientific theory and invention<br />  into absurd myths about gods and supernatural creatures, creating magical<br />  phenomenon to reward and punish the masses. Al Biruni, who was a product of<br />  Islam in its most progressive period, when the memory of fighting irrational<br />  customs and superstitious beliefs was still fresh and alive, was naturally<br />  baffled by this contradiction.*<br />  **<br />  *Islam: Vehicle of international trade and exchange of ideas*<br />  *Having fought idol worship and empty rituals of sacrifice and cleansing<br />  in the Arab peninsula, Islam was not exactly unsuited to shaking up the<br />  sub-continent. Notwithstanding the tremendous achievements of pre-Islamic<br />  India, there is little evidence that pre-Islamic India was at par in the<br />  realm of experimental and applied physics. Here, the Greeks and the Chinese<br />  were far advanced. And what Islam provided, before and after the 10th<br />  century, was a powerful vehicle for the international flow of ideas and<br />  products.*<br />  **<br />  *Just as Buddhism had taken the intellectual advances of the sub-continent<br />  and spread them eastwards, Islam in its early phase spread the intellectual<br />  knowledge of India and China westwards. The Arabs integrated the knowledge<br />  of the East with the knowledge of the Ancient Greeks and Babylonians, adding<br />  and elaborating on what was already known.*<br />  *In the second phase of Islam (from the 12th century on), India became a<br />  beneficiary of this process, and technologies from Iraq and Iran, from China<br />  and Central Asia were absorbed and assimilated into the sub-continent. By<br />  the 13th century, India had become one evance diminished as reliance on the<br />  rains for irrigation decreased. *<br />  *With growth in agricultural production came increased tax revenue which<br />  financed the construction of monumental state buildings and increased the<br />  consumption of manufactured goods. Advances like the spinning-wheel created<br />  opportunities for expanding the textile industry, leading to new<br />  requirements for tailors, weavers, dyers and embroiders. Innovations also<br />  took place in metallurgy and glass production. All of this augmented the<br />  demand for construction and manufacturing labor.*<br />  *New urban centers came up around specialized manufacturing sites, with<br />  conversions to Islam taking place to ease the shortage of labor in new job<br />  categories. Such conversions often came with the undying loyalty of the<br />  converted since this alternative work liberated formerly low-caste Hindus<br />  from highly demeaning and poorly remunerated work. *<br />  *Mobility also came through the army where soldiers were recruited from<br />  all castes and promotions were not restricted to specific castes.<br />  Exceptional performance in the battlefield could permit a low-caste Hinduto<br />  rise up to the ranks of a battalion commander or even a general.*<br />  *In contrast, much of Hindu-ruled society, had become repressive and<br />  stagnant. In several regions, caste rule had become rigid and parasitical,<br />  and the masses had little incentive to save these moribund societies from<br />  the advent of Islam. This is not to say that Islam did not destroy or take<br />  away much of what may have still been culturally vibrant, or that Islam<br />  wasn't equally repressive in it's own way, but rather that Hinduism had, by<br />  and large, reached a certain plateau and the conflict with Islam would<br />  eventually yield a more fecund and advanced society.*<br />  **<br />  *That even some popular Hindu kingdoms got swept away in the cauldron of<br />  Islamic conquests is unfortunate collateral damage that came with the<br />  general collapse of Hindu rule. But it wasn't military prowess that<br />  sustained Islam. Islam, as it spread along the Silk route, was to be the<br />  vehicle to bring new ideas to the sub-continent. China, Persia and the Arab<br />  world were developing new technologies that would soon find their way into<br />  India. And this was to be Islam's primary contribution to India*<br />  **<br />  *Dividing the mental from the physical*<br />  *One of the reasons that Hindu society, even as it was able to foster and<br />  develop abstract and speculative thinking, failed to understand the<br />  potential of experimental and applied physics and bring about technological<br />  innovation. was because of its tendency to separating the mental from<br />  physical. The more influence Brahmins acquired in society, the more detached<br />  they became from the working masses, from skilled craftspeople and artisans.<br />  *<br />  **<br />  *This separation between mental and physical work meant that no caste<br />  could take up the work of experimental physics. The Brahmins couldn't<br />  conduct the experiments because it meant handling all kinds of "impure"<br />  materials and the working castes simply weren't educated enough so lacked<br />  the scientific and logical training to allow them to study physics and use<br />  it to develop new technologies and build new tools.*<br />  *Precisely for this reason, Brahminical India had a poor record in<br />  inventing labor saving technologies. The elaborate caste system made it too<br />  easy to dump all the dirty work on someone else.*<br />  *Societies that are socially conservative have rarely displayed an<br />  understanding of physics and its power to change the world. That is why<br />  India needed Buddhism and Islam, and later Sikhism, to challenge the<br />  ossifying tendencies that are inherent in conservative Hinduism.*<br />  *For several centuries Christianity too, was extremely conservative and<br />  ridden with superstition and false belief. In such an environment science<br />  couldn't flourish, and Europe went through its long dark ages. But mounting<br />  social challenges to Christianity and the growth of rational thinkers meant<br />  that by the middle of the 15th century (if not earlier), Europe was<br />  awakening from its slumber. The scientific advances of the Arab world were<br />  assimilated and enhanced by the Europeans. By the end of the 18th century<br />  the Western ascent had begun.*<br />  **<br />  *Science and Technology in Modern India*<br />  *Today we can see how India, as the world's first nation to understand<br />  planetary motion in all its complexity, has emerged as a leading nation in<br />  space technology. We can see how the first nation to speculate about atomic<br />  particles has made advances in nuclear technology. We can see the ancient<br />  mathematical genius manifest itself in computer programming.*<br />  **<br />  *But we also see how India imports most of the hardware required in the<br />  computer industry, how it imports whole assembly lines and advanced<br />  machine-tools. This nation can launch its own satellites, but cannot improve<br />  something more mundane, like a car or bus engine. We see how one of the<br />  hottest countries in the world can't innovate on appliances like<br />  air-conditioners and refrigerators. We need to beg the Americans and the<br />  Japanese to bring us the latest technology for these devices.*<br />  **<br />  *One of the reasons this has happened is that India's leading<br />  industrialists like the Tatas and Birlas were allowed to function in a<br />  caste-like uncompetitive environment. With the License Raj allowing big<br />  industrial houses to ward off competitors, liberal rates of profit were<br />  virtually guaranteed.*<br />  * Industrial monopolists could thrive without intellectual or<br />  entrepreneurial effort. Like the Brahmins of yester-years, the captains of<br />  industry along with their cohorts in the bureaucracy, became detached and<br />  distant from the masses of the country. Technological stagnation was an<br />  inevitable consequence.*<br />  *Yet, this was not always the case with the Indian entrepreneurs. Consider<br />  how in the 18th century the Wadias of Bombay were producing ships as fineas<br />  any British vessel. Indian entrepreneurs of that period had fortunes<br />  comparable to their European counterparts.*<br />  *Consider this following quote: "According to certain travelers, Surat was<br />  then the most beautiful city of India. One small detail will give an ideaof<br />  the unparalleled luxury that prevailed there: certain streets were paved<br />  with porcelain. Francois Martin in his Memoires calls it 'a real Babylon.'''<br />  *<br />  *But once British rule established itself, the entrepreneurs of that age<br />  were wiped out. The new class of Indian industrialists that emerged during<br />  British rule were the "gomostahs," i.e. the go-betweens that assisted the<br />  British in procuring cheap raw materials from the country and offered to<br />  market British-made goods in the country. A few dozen of them (like the<br />  Tatas and Birlas) were permitted to set up small ancillary industries that<br />  complemented British industry and served the needs of the British empire in<br />  India. Given this origin, it isn't difficult to see why many of India's<br />  post-independence industrialists had a hard time overcoming the tendency to<br />  remain as "gomostahs" and traders. The trader isn't particularly concerned<br />  about value-addition as long as there is quick profit to be made through<br />  buying and selling. *</p>
