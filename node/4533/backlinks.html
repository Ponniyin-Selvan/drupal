        <p>Beautiful<br />:)</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "arunn" <arunn28@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  i have read balakumaran,akilan,paarthasarathi,vikraman,Sandiyan,KALKI</p>
<p>  akilan..<br />  some what influenced by Kalki... as with Vengaiin Maithan(not in the <br />  plots but at some times the style of writing and the <br />  Characterisation)...but the other novel ( i couldn't remember the <br />  name, that deals with thirumalai nayakar..) couldn't find much <br />  resemblance with Kalki.<br />  his writings does not involve high level plots and twists.. he <br />  explains things plainly.. but still a gud read... pleasing to read.<br />  the hero will always be "volukaseelan" as common with most of tamil <br />  novels.<br />  rating:<br />  plot and twist : not much... ok type<br />  feel gud factor: good<br />  facts and history: medium <br />  character's mentality: somewhat emotional.<br />  protagonist is a gud guy..not down to earth nor larger than  <br />  life character.. but inbetween them and more of a decent veeran..<br />  language used by characters: pleasant.<br />  Romance scenes : old style�.emotional�. very decent.(U rating)<br />  verdict: excellent in writing decent time pass works.</p>
<p>  balakumaran..<br />  i have read his "udaiyar". he thinks too much. he is interested in <br />  his imagination of people's emotions than that of the story (if any) <br />  or the history itself. <br />  he some times confuses the reader ..confliting his facts itself..one <br />  such occasion is that ..he introduces Panchvan maadevi as some kalai <br />  magal cast(i forgot the exact word..sorry..) who devote themselves <br />  for the kalai...she even thinks that RRC thannai sukithu vittu <br />  sendrirukalam aanaal he married me and gave me life....but in his <br />  next book( in another part) she is described as the princess of <br />  paluvetaraiyar royal family....(horrible contradiction)<br />  he believes in supertition(i wonder how he does this..in 1940's - <br />  50's kalki opposes superstition in his works...in 2005and after <br />  that.. this guy thinks the other way!!)<br />  plots are horrible...the way RRC and his subordinates discuss and <br />  plan for their attack on chalukayas for want money for the completion <br />  of Periya koil and therby the way they achieve it ...God! no words... <br />  he easily diverts the flow from the story line� not a good practice.<br />  rating:<br />  plot and twist : He He <br />  feel gud factor: worst<br />  facts and history: below par most times�but makes it up some times <br />  by throwing info offline.<br />  character's mentality: mostly aggressive. Nobody will be <br />  good..mostly every one will be error prone except for a very few <br />  Godly creatures�<br />  language used by characters: unpleasant.<br />  Romance scenes : some what open� not that decent.but ETHARTHAM...He <br />  is really gud at it. (U/A rating)<br />  verdict: excellent in writing social Novels.	</p>
<p>  paarthasarathi<br />  have read his book that explains Pandiyan King Kodungon(who <br />  reestablishes thamizh kingdom from the kalaprabhas ). Another book <br />  again forgot the title�<br />  that starts with "pallava�." � I couldn't read it. I leftit some <br />  half way thro it. He is not interested in too much of historical <br />  facts but still manages to catch the crux of it to spin a story. In <br />  his stories there will be a triangular(even quadrangle..) love affair <br />  � mostly the king �becos of his duty conscious mentality will leave <br />  his love interest stranded in the end. His writings are similar to <br />  serials and drrammaas or even flims that were shot during 1960's �to <br />  70's.</p>
<p>  rating:<br />  plot and twist : not much... sorry<br />  feel gud factor: good<br />  facts and history: medium <br />  character's mentality: Mainly emotional.<br />  language used by characters: pleasant.<br />  Romance scenes : decent. (U rating)<br />  verdict: can read.. his language command is Gud..</p>
<p>  vikraman<br />  A decent historian rather than story writer,� his Nanthi purathu <br />  Nayagi� was gud at the start � but I dunno what happened thereafter. <br />  He introduces character in the first part � only to forget completely <br />  in the subsequent parts...his work on RJC's GKC mmm... I didn't <br />  complete�.<br />  His travelogues are better�even better than Kalki's(might be an <br />  exaggeration). <br />  rating:<br />  plot and twist : please look else where  <br />  feel gud factor: good<br />  facts and history: decent.<br />  character's mentality: ---<br />  Romance scenes : decent. (U rating)<br />  language used by characters: pleasant <br />  verdict: Gud in writing travelogues.	</p>
<p>  Sandilyan,<br />  does a gud research work before writing any trival thing� language is <br />  excellent. Larger than life characters. Highly romantic� always <br />  positive ending�<br />  rating:<br />  plot and twist : very Gud � but the hero thrashes the opponent with <br />  ease- like rajini .<br />  feel gud factor: good<br />  facts and history: decent.<br />  character's mentality: highy talented highly romantic<br />  Romance scenes : . -U/A rating. Very gud at describing physical <br />  attributes of the characters without touching the lines of vulgarity.<br />  Mathil mel punai� but the punai lands safely <br />  in the end.<br />  language used by characters: pleasant .. high level in literature <br />  Thamizh<br />  verdict: Gud read�similar to watching MGR or Rajini films.	</p>
<p>  KALKI,<br />  Hero of all writers in Thamizh� stunning plots and twists..some times <br />  dramatic� this guy is responsible for many people taking interests in <br />  history with his block buster PS..have read almost all of his writings<br />  (short stories , novels both historical and social) very very gud <br />  read.<br />  Put ..

<p>  balakumaran..<br />  i have read his "udaiyar". he thinks too much. he is interested in<br />  his imagination of people's emotions than that of the story (if any)<br />  or the history itself.<br />  he some times confuses the reader ..confliting his facts itself..one<br />  such occasion is that ..he introduces Panchvan maadevi as some kalai<br />  magal cast(i forgot the exact word..sorry..) who devote themselves<br />  for the kalai...she even thinks that RRC thannai sukithu vittu<br />  sendrirukalam aanaal he married me and gave me life....but in his<br />  next book( in another part) she is described as the princess of<br />  paluvetaraiyar royal family....(horrible contradiction)<br />  he believes in supertition(i wonder how he does this..in 1940's -<br />  50's kalki opposes superstition in his works...in 2005and after<br />  that.. this guy thinks the other way!!)<br />  plots are horrible...the way RRC and his subordinates discuss and<br />  plan for their attack on chalukayas for want money for the completion<br />  of Periya koil and therby the way they achieve it ...God! no words...<br />  he easily diverts the flow from the story line? not a good practice.<br />  rating:<br />  plot and twist : He He<br />  feel gud factor: worst<br />  facts and history: below par most times?but makes it up some times<br />  by throwing info offline.<br />  character's mentality: mostly aggressive.

Another book<br />  again forgot the title?<br />  that starts with "pallava?." ? I couldn't read it. I left it some<br />  half way thro it. He is not interested in too much of historical<br />  facts but still manages to catch the crux of it to spin a story. In<br />  his stories there will be a triangular(even quadrangle..) love affair<br />  ? mostly the king ?becos of his duty conscious mentality will leave<br />  his love interest stranded in the end. His writings are similar to<br />  serials and drrammaas or even flims that were shot during 1960's ?to<br />  70's.</p>

<p>  vikraman<br />  A decent historian rather than story writer,? his Nanthi purathu<br />  Nayagi? was gud at the start ? but I dunno what happened thereafter.<br />  He introduces character in the first part ? only to forget completely<br />  in the subsequent parts...his work on RJC's GKC mmm...

His writings are similar to <br />serials and drrammaas or even flims that were shot during 1960's ?to <br />70's.</p>
<p>rating:<br />plot and twist : not much... sorry<br />feel gud factor: good<br />facts and history: medium <br />character's mentality: Mainly emotional.<br />language used by characters: pleasant.<br />Romance scenes : decent. (U rating)<br />verdict: can read.. his language command is Gud..</p>
<p>vikraman<br />A decent historian rather than story writer,? his Nanthi purathu <br />Nayagi? was gud at the start ? but I dunno what happened thereafter. <br />He introduces character in the first part ? only to forget completely <br />in the subsequent parts...his work on RJC's GKC mmm... I didn't <br />complete?.<br />His travelogues are better?even better than Kalki's(might be an <br />exaggeration). <br />rating:<br />plot and twist : please look else where  <br />feel gud factor: good<br />facts and history: decent.<br />character's mentality: ---<br />Romance scenes : decent. (U rating)<br />language used by characters: pleasant <br />verdict: Gud in writing travelogues.	</p>
<p>Sandilyan,<br />does a gud research work before writing any trival thing? language is <br />excellent. Larger than life characters. Highly romantic? always <br />positive ending?<br />rating:<br />plot and twist : very Gud ? but the hero thrashes the opponent with <br />ease- like rajini .<br />feel gud factor: good<br />facts and history: decent.<br />character's mentality: highy talented highly romantic<br />Romance scenes : . -U/A rating. Very gud at describing physical <br />attributes of the characters without touching the lines of vulgarity.<br />Mathil mel punai? but the punai lands safely <br />in the end.<br />language used by characters: pleasant .. high level in literature <br />Thamizh<br />verdict: Gud read?similar to watching MGR or Rajini films.	</p>
<p>KALKI,<br />Hero of all writers in Thamizh? stunning plots and twists..some times <br />dramatic? this guy is responsible for many people taking interests in <br />history with his block buster PS..have read almost all of his writings<br />(short stories , novels both historical and social) very very gud <br />read.<br />Put .. PS group members should not be offended from what I am going <br />to say ?..sorry?.<br />But?. Mostly inspired from Alexandre Dumas in his historical <br />writings?. His PS is some what shaped in lines of "three musketeers"<br />Our very own Vandhiyathevan resembles D'Arthagnan?<br />Nandini ----- Milady.<br />Nandini kills Aditya karikalan with the help of a pro pandiyan <br />enthusiast?? milady seduces a Felton to kill the minister?<br />Vandhi opposes Nandinini her mission?. D'Arthagnan does it against <br />Milady.<br />Nandini succeeds ?.milady succeeds.<br />Vandhi is attracted by Nandini.. even tries to please her or see her, <br />but still at heart is committed to Kundavai,?<br />D'Arthagnan does the same for Milady,,, still at heart he was in love <br />with some other girl(forgot name).<br />Another girl (kantha maraan's siter ) loves Vanthi?. Same happens for <br />D'Arthagnan.<br />The way our Vandhiya thevan escapes from nilavari resembles that of <br />the hero's work in "the count of monte cresto"?..<br />there are lots more... please read "3 musk".<br />?.but personally PS is far more interesting and a better book(this is <br />didn't say to please our PS members? but felt at heart).wonder how he <br />manages to map the story to a historical event in THAMIZ Nadu.  <br />rating:<br />plot and twist : Ultimate.<br />feel gud factor: very good<br />facts and history: decent.<br />character's mentality: ----<br />Romance scenes : . ?U rating. the one that impressed me? if I am to <br />write a romance sceen .. will definitely follow his foot steps<br />(inspirational).<br />language used by characters: pleasant .. <br />verdict: the best in business? .	</p>

        <p>Hi,<br />Yes, The Nicobar <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  was dragging, especially after introducing<br />Gangadevan who is killed by the hero. Since from the beginning of part<br />I conquering Srivijayam was mentioned as the ultimate goal, I had<br />expected a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  too much from the author.

        <p>Dear Sivaram and all</p>
<p>Akilan, I have read only Venkayin Mainden. That was really surprising as it <br />was so different from Kalki and Sandilyan. The hero is kind of dump, he gets <br />hurt, he is human and stupid sometimes. Sometimes he also behaves very cruelly to one of heroine, Rohini. </p>
<p>I dont think that Ilango was a dump Siva...second his Ilango and Rohini were more like Kalkis charectors which changed minds had mood swings and all</p>
<p>And Yavanarani only one marries the hero and same in Vamsathara....<br />Regards<br />Sri</p>

        <p>Hi,<br />I read Rajah Thilakam before even I touched Kalki's works. After<br />reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  I read a lot of Kalki's short novels and just now I<br />finished Kadal Pura and have started Jegasirpiyan's Alavaialzhagan.<br />I agree with the following points w.r.t Sandilyan.<br />1. The hero in Sandilyan novels are more than life like.<br />2. They know it all.<br />3. At times I dont understand why two people in the same situation<br />cannot think in the same lines as the hero. <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  illogical to me since<br />this happens everytime.<br />4. The hero always falls in love with two women.<br />5. In the end he marries both of them.<br />6. The women he potrays are very brave ones but are self-depreciating<br />when they think w.r.t the hero. Of the two one is dominant and the<br />other submissive. </acronym></acronym></p>
<p>I have few bones of contention. Sandilyan didnt emphasize much on the<br />third part of Kadal Pura. He did a good description of palur port and<br />things like that in first part. I was not satisfied with the<br />description of the war to win over Srivijayam. I felt he took us very<br />quickly about the turn of events. </p>
<p>I agree that he cannot satisfy every one's imagination. But stil....my<br />opinions....</p>
<p>Jegasirpiyan's novels are short and quite descriptive at the same<br />time. I have read Makarayaalzh mangai. It was fast paced and good<br />narration. One feels in the end "Yeh Dil Maange More" <br />:)<br />Regards,<br />Ragothaman</p>

        <p>My initial historic novel reading started off with Sandilyan and then Kalki<br />and others.</p>
<p>1. he used to give equal weight to both Hero and the Opponent (not a<br />villain).<br />2. His works have more "Sirungara Rasam" as he himself quoted on one of his<br />novels introduction. Sometime between real characters!.<br />3. More fictional characters, and from my reading experience most of the<br />heroes and heroines.<br />4. Episodes will end with dramatic twists and turns. As the other member<br />pointed out, the hero's strategy will be invincible and sometime will be<br />very dramatic.</p>

<p>Out of the lot that participated Mudhal yaathirai (pls go through<br />Files section for details or search Mudhal yaathirai in our Archieves<br />- first trip - Vandayathevan vazhiyil ) initiated by Kamal @<br />adithakarikalan of our Group (one of the editors of varalaaru.com team<br />) I think me and Pavithra are only now in South / India.</p>
<p>Vishvakshenan was kind enough to guide the lot - thanks to the effort<br />of Kamal, who spoke to Kalki Weekly on this. There was a follow up<br />write up of the trip by Vishvakshenan and another Sun TV capsule on<br />this..</p>

The author I have enjoyed most was Viswakesan(I have<br />read most<br />  of the books that came in Kalki, but could not remember the name) .<br />I felt<br />  Neelambaran and Vishwakesan both seemed to be inspired by Sandilyan(that<br />  is hero is invincible). what made Viswakesan enjoyable to me is the<br />comic<br />  element in his writing. I read one book of Neelambaran(Chola Vengai) and<br />  have decided not to buy any more book by him.</p>
<p>  Akilan, I have read only Venkayin Mainden. That was really<br />surprising as it<br />  was so different from Kalki and Sandilyan. The hero is kind of dump,<br />he gets</p>
<p>  hurt, he is human and stupid sometimes. Sometimes he also behaves very<br />  cruelly<br />  to one of heroine, Rohini.</p>
<p>  And one comman trait found in the books of all the authors I have<br />read is<br />  that two<br />  girls will be madly in love with the hero and mostly hero will be ending<br />  both the girls.</p>
