</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Godse's defense speech in court (a must read confession) </p>
<p>This is the speech given by nathuram godse in the court when he was<br />tried for the murder of mahatma Gandhi....really solid facts</p>
<p>Do read this....really hard-hitting</p>
<p>Born in a devotional Brahmin family, I instinctively came to revere<br />Hindu<br />religion, Hindu history and Hindu culture. I had, therefore, been<br />intensely<br />proud of Hinduism as a whole. As I grew up I developed a tendency to free<br />thinking unfettered by any superstitious allegiance to any isms, political<br />or religious. That is why I worked actively for the eradication of<br />untouchability and the caste system based on birth alone. I openly joined<br />anti-caste movements and maintained that all Hindus were of equal status as<br />to rights, social and religious and should be considered high or low on merit<br />alone and not through the accident of birth in a particular caste or<br />profession. I used publicly to take part in organized anti-caste dinners<br />in which thousands of Hindus, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Chamars<br />and Bhangis participated. We broke the caste rules and dined in the<br />company of each other.</p>
<p>I have read the speeches and writings of Dadabhai Naoroji, Vivekanand,<br />Gokhale, Tilak, along with the books of ancient and modern history of<br />India and some prominent countries like England, France, America and'<br />Russia. Moreover I studied the tenets of Socialism and Marxism. But above<br />all I studied very closely whatever Veer Savarkar and Gandhiji had written<br />and spoken, as to my mind these two ideologies have contributed more to<br />the moulding of the thought and action of the Indian people during the<br />last thirty years or so, than any other single factor has done.</p>
<p>All this reading and thinking led me to believe it was my first duty to<br />serve Hindudom and Hindus both as a patriot and as a world citizen.<br />To secure the freedom and to safeguard the just interests of some thirty<br />crores (300 million) of Hindus would automatically constitute the freedom<br />and the well-being of all India, one fifth of human race. This conviction<br />led me naturally to devote myself to the Hindu Sanghtanist ideology<br />and programme, which alone, I came to believe, could win and preserve<br />the national independence of Hindustan, my Motherland, and enable her to<br />render true service to humanity as well.</p>
<p>Since the year 1920, that is, after the demise of Lokamanya Tilak,<br />Gandhiji's influence in the Congress first increased and then became<br />supreme. His activities for public awakening were phenomenal in their<br />intensity and were reinforced by the slogan of truth and non-violence<br />which he paraded ostentatiously before the country. No sensible or<br />enlightened person could object to those slogans. In fact there is nothing<br />new or original in them. They are implicit in every constitutional<br />public movement. But it is nothing but a mere dream if you imagine<br />that the bulk of mankind is, or can ever become, capable of scrupulous<br />adherence to these lofty principles in its normal life from day to day.<br />In fact, hunour, duty and love of one's own kith and kin and country might<br />often compel us to disregard non-violence and to use force. I could never<br />conceive that an armed resistance to an aggression is unjust. I would<br />consider it a religious and moral duty to resist and, if possible, to<br />overpower such an enemy by use of force. [In the Ramayana] Rama killed<br />Ravana in a tumultuous fight and relieved Sita. [In the Mahabharata],<br />Krishna killed Kansa to end his wickedness; and Arjuna had to fight<br />and slay quite a number of his friends and relations including the<br />revered Bhishma because the latter was on the side of the aggressor.<br />It is my firm belief that in dubbing Rama, Krishna and Arjuna as guilty<br />of violence, the Mahatma betrayed a total ignorance of the springs of<br />human action.</p>
<p>In more recent history, it was the heroic fight put up by Chhatrapati<br />Shivaji that first checked and eventually destroyed the Muslim tyranny<br />in India. It was absolutely essentially for Shivaji to overpower and kill<br />an aggressive Afzal Khan, failing which he would have lost his own life.<br />In condemning history's towering warriors like Shivaji, Rana Pratap and<br />Guru Gobind Singh as misguided patriots, Gandhiji has merely exposed his<br />self-conceit. He was, paradoxical as it may appear, a violent pacifist<br />who brought untold calamities on the country in the name of truth and<br />non-violence, while Rana Pratap, Shivaji and the Guru will remain<br />enshrined in the hearts of their countrymen for ever for the freedom<br />they brought to them.</p>
<p>The accumulating provocation of thirty-two years, culminating in his last<br />pro-Muslim fast, at last goaded me to the conclusion that the existence<br />of Gandhi should be brought to an end immediately. Gandhi had done very<br />good in South Africa to uphold the rights and well-being of the Indian<br />community there. But when he finally returned to India he developed a<br />subjective mentality under which he alone was to be the final judge of<br />what was right or wrong. If the country wanted his leadership, it had to<br />accept his infallibility; if it did not, he would stand aloof from the<br />Congress and carry on his own way. Against such an attitude there can be<br />no halfway house. Either Congress had to surrender its will to his and had<br />to be content with playing second fiddle to all his eccentricity,<br />whimsicality, metaphysics and primitive vision, or it had to carry on<br />without him. He alone was the Judge of everyone and every thing; he was<br />the master brain guiding the civil disobedience movement; no other<br />could know the technique of that movement. He alone knew when to begin<br />and when to withdraw it. The movement might succeed or fail, it might<br />bring untold disaster and political reverses but that could make no<br />difference to the Mahatma's infallibility. 'A Satyagrahi can never fail'<br />was his formula for declaring his own infallibility and nobody except<br />himself knew what a Satyagrahi is.</p>
<p>Thus, the Mahatma became the judge and jury in his own cause. These<br />childish insanities and obstinacies, coupled with a most severe austerity<br />of life, ceaseless work and lofty character made Gandhi formidable and<br />irresistible. Many people thought that his politics were irrational<br />but they had either to withdraw from the Congress or place their<br />intelligence at his feet to do with as he liked. In a position of such<br />absolute irresponsibility Gandhi was guilty of blunder after blunder,<br />failure after failure, disaster after disaster.</p>
<p>Gandhi's pro-Muslim policy is blatantly in his perverse attitude on<br />the question of the national language of India. It is quite obvious<br />that Hindi has the most prior claim to be accepted as the premier<br />language. In the beginning of his career in India, Gandhi gave a great<br />impetus to Hindi but as he found that the Muslims did not like it, he<br />became a champion of what is called Hindustani. Everybody in India<br />knows that there is no language called Hindustani; it has no grammar; it<br />has no vocabulary. It is a mere dialect, it is spoken, but not written.<br />It is a bastard tongue and cross-breed between Hindi and Urdu, and<br />not even the Mahatma's sophistry could make it popular. But in his<br />desire to please the Muslims he insisted that Hindustani alone should be<br />the national language of India. His blind followers, of course,<br />supported him and the so-called hybrid language began to be used.<br />The charm and purity of the Hindi language was to be prostituted to<br />please the Muslims. All his experiments were at the expense of the<br />Hindus.</p>
<p>a massacre of the Hindus. The then Viceroy, Lord Wavell, though<br />distressed at what was happening, would not use his powers under the<br />Government of India Act of 1935 to prevent the rape, murder and arson.<br />The Hindu blood began to flow from Bengal to Karachi with some<br />retaliation by the Hindus. The Interim Government formed in September<br />was sabotaged by its Muslim League members right from its inception,<br />but the more they became disloyal and treasonable to the government of<br />which they were a part, the greater was Gandhi's infatuation for them.<br />Lord Wavell had to resign as he could not bring about a settlement and<br />he was succeeded by Lord Mountbatten. King Log was followed by King<br />Stork.</p>
<p>The Congress which had boasted of its nationalism and socialism<br />secretly accepted Pakistan literally at the point of the bayonet and<br />abjectly surrendered to Jinnah. India was vivisected and one-third of<br />the Indian territory became foreign land to us from August 15, 1947.<br />Lord Mountbatten came to be described in Congress circles as the greatest<br />Viceroy and Governor-General this country ever had. The official date<br />for handing over power was fixed for June 30, 1948, but<br />Mountbatten with his ruthless surgery gave us a gift of vivisected<br />India ten months in advance. This is what Gandhi had achieved after<br />thirty years of undisputed dictatorship and this is what Congress party<br />calls 'freedom' and 'peaceful transfer of power'. The Hindu-Muslim<br />unity bubble was finally burst and a theocratic state was established<br />with the consent of Nehru and his crowd and they have called 'freedom<br />won by them with sacrifice' - whose sacrifice? When top leaders of<br />Congress, with the consent of Gandhi, divided and tore the country -<br />which we consider a deity of worship - my mind was filled with direful<br />anger.</p>
<p>One of the conditions imposed by Gandhi for his breaking of the fast<br />unto death related to the mosques in Delhi occupied by the Hindu<br />refugees. But when Hindus in Pakistan were subjected to violent attacks<br />he did not so much as utter a single word to protest and censure the<br />Pakistan Government or the Muslims concerned. Gandhi was shrewd enough<br />to know that while undertaking a fast unto death, had he imposed for<br />its break some condition on the Muslims in Pakistan, there would have<br />been found hardly any Muslims who could have shown some grief if the<br />fast had ended in his death. It was for this reason that he purposely<br />avoided imposing any condition on the Muslims. He was fully aware of<br />from the experience that Jinnah was not at all perturbed or influenced<br />by his fast and the Muslim League hardly attached any value to the<br />inner voice of Gandhi.</p>
<p>Gandhi is being referred to as the Father of the Nation. But if that<br />is so, he had failed his paternal duty inasmuch as he has acted very<br />treacherously to the nation by his consenting to the partitioning of it.<br />I stoutly maintain that Gandhi has failed in his duty. He has proved<br />to be the Father of Pakistan. His inner-voice, his spiritual power and<br />his doctrine of non-violence of which so much is made of, all crumbled<br />before Jinnah's iron will and proved to be powerless.</p>
<p>Briefly speaking, I thought to myself and foresaw I shall be totally<br />ruined, and the only thing I could expect from the people would be<br />nothing but hatred and that I shall have lost all my honour, even more<br />valuable than my life, if I were to kill Gandhiji. But at the same time<br />I felt that the Indian politics in the absence of Gandhiji would surely<br />be proved practical, able to retaliate, and would be powerful with<br />armed forces. No doubt, my own future would be totally ruined, but the<br />nation would be saved from the inroads of Pakistan. People may even<br />call me and dub me as devoid of any sense or foolish, but the nation<br />would be free to follow the course founded on the reason which I consider<br />to be necessary for sound nation-building. After having fully considered<br />the question, I took the final decision in the matter, but I did not<br />speak about it to anyone whatsoever. I took courage in both my hands<br />and I did fire the shots at Gandhiji on 30th January 1948, on the<br />prayer-grounds of Birla House.</p>
<p>I do say that my shots were fired at the person whose policy and action<br />had brought rack and ruin and destruction to millions of Hindus.<br />There was no legal machinery by which such an offender could be<br />brought to book and for this reason I fired those fatal shots.</p>
<p>I bear no ill will towards anyone individually but I do say that I had<br />no respect for the present government owing to their policy which was<br />unfairly favourable towards the Muslims. But at the same time I could<br />clearly see that the policy was entirely due to the presence of Gandhi.<br />I have to say with great regret that Prime Minister Nehru quite forgets<br />that his preachings and deeds are at times at variances with each other<br />when he talks about India as a secular state in season and out of<br />season, because it is significant to note that Nehru has played a<br />leading role in the establishment of the theocratic state of Pakistan,<br />and his job was made easier by Gandhi's persistent policy of<br />appeasement towards the Muslims.</p>
<p>I now stand before the court to accept the full share of my responsibility<br />for what I have done and the judge would, of course, pass against me<br />such orders of sentence as may be considered proper. But I would like<br />to add that I do not desire any mercy to be shown to me, nor do I wish<br />that anyone else should beg for mercy on my behalf. My confidence about<br />the moral side of my action has not been shaken even by the criticism<br />levelled against it on all sides. I have no doubt that honest writers of</p>
<p>history will weigh my act and find the true value thereof some day<br />in future.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Godse's defense speech in court (a must read confession) </p>
<p>  This is the speech given by nathuram godse in the court when he was<br />  tried for the murder of mahatma Gandhi....really solid facts</p>
<p>  Do read this....really hard-hitting<br />  =======================================</p></blockquote>
<p>During the period of EMERGENCY, when Press Censorship was in force <br />(1975)?), journalist CHO wrote of the Film Review of the old Tamil <br />Film 'SARVADHIKARI" (DICTATOR) and got the matter published !</p>
<p>Today, in our Motherland, speaking in favour of HINDUISM itself is being <br />(mis)interpreted as Anti-Secular!</p>

        <p>Dear Mohanavel<br />interesting read..!!!<br />Everybody has his reasons and justifications...It would have been <br />very impresive if the Sangh had taken arms and fought the british and <br />chased them away...<br />Even the great Netaji neede the Japanese to help him fight the british</p>
<p>All he could do was weild his weapon on a unarmed oldman in a prayer <br />ground very impressive and there are outfits which want polital <br />mileage about anything so this has made an appearance</p>
<p>The Indo Pak divide is called the greatest and Bloodiest Divorse in <br />the World....</p>
<p>Why because we were trying to preserve a land mass under one union <br />following an occupation and preserve it...</p>
<p>If interested Read<br />Freedom at Midnight by Larry Collins and Dominique Lappieere(of City <br />of Joy)</p>
<p>Its a book every indian shoud read which starts with Gandhis Naokhali <br />Hunger strike and ends with his death</p>

        <p>Interesting...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  Gandhi's pro-Muslim policy is blatantly in his perverse attitude on<br />  the question of the national language of India. It is quite obvious<br />  that Hindi has the most prior claim to be accepted as the premier<br />  language. In the beginning of his career in India, Gandhi gave a great<br />  impetus to Hindi but as he found that the Muslims did not like it, he<br />  became a champion of what is called Hindustani. Everybody in India<br />  knows that there is no language called Hindustani; it has no grammar; it<br />  has no vocabulary. It is a mere dialect, it is spoken, but not written.<br />  It is a bastard tongue and cross-breed between Hindi and Urdu, and<br />  not even the Mahatma's sophistry could make it popular. But in his<br />  desire to please the Muslims he insisted that Hindustani alone should be<br />  the national language of India. His blind followers, of course,<br />  supported him and the so-called hybrid language began to be used.<br />  The charm and purity of the Hindi language was to be prostituted to<br />  please the Muslims. All his experiments were at the expense of the<br />  Hindus.</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Looks like no one ever thought about the south indian languages.. and how <br />they are very different from the hindi/hindustani/urdu..</p>
<p>Nice to know different perspectives.. But violence/murder is not a solution <br />to any of the grievances.. Infact Godse's murderous act setback his goals <br />by atleast 50 years and resulted in more minority communalist appeasement..</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Naren.</p>
