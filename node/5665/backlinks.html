<p>we are told often that the nataraja form is a creation of the chola <br />empire - though the form does feature much earlier, it was under <br />them that it was cast in bronze and accquired its current <br />definition. this is a spendid book ( more a penance)....some <br />excerpts...</p>
<p>NATARAJA ? THE LORD OF DANCE<br />C.Sivaramamurti</p>
<p>The composer of an inscription has said, and probably, in a normal<br />sense, rightly, that dance in the darkness is an impossibility. Let<br />kings compose hundreds of mellifluous poems, or chum up hosts of foes<br />on the battlefield, or scatter their wealth on deserving donees, but<br />with the passage of time all these their exploits would be like<br />dancing in utter darkness if these were not recorded by poets in<br />prasastis: kurvantu kirtanasatani rananganeshu mathnantu vairinikaram<br />dhanam utsrijantu kalanatare tad akhilam prabalandhakaranrityopamam<br />kavijanair anibaddhyamanam (Epigraph. Ind. 27, p. 281).</p>
<p>Dance in the darkness is no doubt unimaginable. But, Siva only <br />chooses<br />the evening for his dance, when it is dark, but the darkness is lit <br />up<br />by his own effulgence, the moon on his crest, the stars around, the<br />flame in his hand, and the powerful rays shooting forth from the gems<br />on the hoods of snakes he wears as his ornaments. This is abundantly<br />illustrated in literature, as stated elsewhere, to show how Siva<br />requires not a powerful light focussed on him, but the mild and soft<br />tone of moonlight, chosen to reveal not too luridly, but softly and<br />gracefully, the movement of his limbs.</p>
<p>Siva's dance cannot be comprehended by lesser masters. It is only the<br />great ones like Brahma, Bharata, Hari, Narada or Skanda who can<br />understand or appreciate his dance. An inscription on the cave temple<br />at Saluvankuppam has a verse to elucidate not only the distinction of<br />Siva's dance, but also to enumerate the great celestial exponents of<br />natya and sangita and their ability, as the right audience, to<br />appreciate Siva's dance: yadi na vidhata bharato yadi na harir narado<br />na va skandha boddhum ka iva samarthas sangitam kalakalasya <br />(Epigraph.<br />Ind. 10, p. 12). The word used here sangita includes music, both <br />vocal<br />and instrumental, and dance. Poetry, music, literature and dance are<br />time arts, while painting, sculpture and architecture are space arts<br />(Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition. Vol. X). The word Kalakala,<br />emphasizing the concept of time and eternity of Siva, appropriately<br />makes him the master of sangita, including music and dance. Ratnakara<br />goes one step further, when he describes even elements like water,<br />personified in the heavenly stream, Ganga, on his head, applauding, <br />as<br />he imagines, his excellence in dance. Siva's dance movements, wherein<br />the excels, are loudly applauded it would seem by the deep rumbling<br />sound of the waves of the heavenly stream entering the hollows of the<br />garland of skulls on his head:<br />kukshipravishtasuranir-jharinitarangajhankarataraninadair<br />nrikapalapanktih nritsatisayasvamandam (Haravijaya 2.57).</p>
<p>It is not only these great gods and goddesses, the creators each in<br />his or her own important way, that are the witnesses to applaud the<br />dance of Siva, but they enthusiastically also join in creating the<br />orchestra for him, by playing the musical instruments. At the very<br />sign of his brow, Vishnu takes up the drum mardala, which, with is<br />noble rumbling notes, like the cloud inspiring the blue-throated<br />peacock to dance, starts the musical sound. With his louts hand,<br />Brahma takes up a pair of cymbals, ostensibly to keep time to the<br />dance of the victor of Kama, but really because they allow his<br />mistaking them for the breasts of his consort, Sarasvati. Indra <br />places<br />the bamboo flute on his lip, the honey of which was lovingly tested <br />by<br />the celestial nymph, Rambha, and even by the excellence of his<br />playing, which keeps the worlds spell-bound, Indra makes himself<br />conspicuous in his high station. Sarasvati, the consort of Brahma,<br />beautifully plays the lute with the rosary placed on her left ear, as<br />if to suggest a faster pace in the musical play. Parvati smiles at <br />the<br />impatience of her beloved one (Siva) to dance, as he gets ready by<br />tying up his locks with the long snake coil and his waist with the<br />elephant hide. Sambhu, the kind-hearted, knowing that his dance<br />festival was not to be comprehended by the mortal eye, graciously<br />bestows divine sight for those who lack it. Then the whole concourse<br />witnesses the dance of Siva, with the locks whirling around and<br />lashing clusters of stars, as his feet with the serpent anklet,<br />jingling at his tread, pushes down the earth: tatra<br />sankarakatakshachoditas charumardalam avadayaddharih yah payoda iti<br />pushkarasrito nilakanthanatanochitadhvanih kamajinnatanakaranena va<br />bharatikuchayugabhramena va tatra talayugalim athadade<br />panipankajayugena padmabhuh rambhaya hritarase radachchhade <br />vamsanalam<br />avasajya vasavah vadanad api vimohayan janan adade kila na<br />vasavasthitam vadaya drutam itiva samsata sphatikakshavalayena<br />dakshine asrita sravasi charuvallakivadanam vyatanute Priya vidheh<br />ayatena phanina jatabharam madhyabhagam ibhacharmakakshyaya badhnatah<br />priyatamasya nartitum vikshya sambhramam uma smitam vyadhat<br />vikshanochitam apamsachakshusha nartanotsavam avekshitum nijam<br />sambhuna sakaladehinam tada divyam akshi didise dayaluna sandadarsa<br />sapadi bhramajjatataditoduputalam tada janah<br />vyalanupuraranatpadarpananyanchitaksshiti natesanartanam<br />(Patanjalicharita 4. 61-67).</p>
<p>As Siva commences his dance in the evening. Ratnakara imagines, in <br />the<br />loftiest terms the sun and moons as the cymbals used by the goddess <br />of<br />prosperity herself for tala and laya, the most important in the <br />nritta<br />aspect of dance. At the commencement of dance by Siva at dusk, with<br />the sun disc setting near the astagiri and the full moon emerging <br />into<br />light from his locks, it seems to make the celestial goddess of<br />prosperity hold as it were these two as cymbals for the Lord's <br />musical<br />orchestra: <br />astavalambiravibimbitayodayadsrichudonmishatsakalachandrataya<br />cha sayam sandhyapranrittaharavadyagrihitakamsyataladvayeva<br />samalakshyata nakalakshmih (Haravijya 19.5).</p>
<p>This exacting musical orchestra, the vina played by the Lady of <br />music,<br />Sarasvati herself, the flute by Indra who excels, Brahma keeping time<br />and Vishnu himself sounding the drum, is because Siva himself is an<br />adept in all the musical instruments. In the Sivasahasranama, there <br />is<br />an elaboration of his musical accomplishments. He is described as<br />Sarvaturyaninadi, he is also Vainavi, Panavi, Vini, Tali and Nali:<br />vainavi panavi kalah kalakanthah katamkatah?.. vini cha panavi tali<br />nail kalikatus tatha sarvaturyaninadi cha sarvavyuapyaparigrahah<br />(Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 11) tumbuvino mahakopah vamsavadi hyaninditah<br />(Linegamahapurana 1, 65, 21) naikatanaratas svarah (Lingamahapurana <br />1,<br />65, 40). The commentary here explains tumbu vina as the vina provided<br />with two gourds and popularly known as Rudra vina. Siva delights in<br />innumerable murchhanas or tanas, and he is of the very nature of the<br />svaras, not only udatta, anudatta, svarita, but the sangita svaras,<br />the seven famous notes. Siva is also called Rathagita: akshayo<br />rathagitas cha (Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 44). Ratha is Rathantarasama,<br />by the chant of which he is invoked. Siva's fondness for Sama is very<br />well known.</p>
<p>associated with several rishis, like Patanjali, Vyaghrapada, Agastya,<br />Durvasa, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana, Sanatkumara, and others.<br />Ramabhadra Dikshita gives a graphic description of the rasied foot of<br />Siva in his bhujangatrasita mode of dance at Chidambaram. Siva's<br />performance of karanas, making up angaharas, which go along with his<br />whirling movements in forming mandalas, scatters a spray of water <br />from<br />the heavenly stream on his head, bathing and purifying, as it were,<br />the entire space around, packed with spectators. The rapid swirl of<br />his arms raises blasts, resounding in the caverns of the mountains of<br />the quarters, while the light form his raised lotus foot, creates a<br />halo of light around him, fully observed only by the side-long <br />glances<br />of Devi, whose dark eyes are twins it would seem of the blue lotus. <br />As<br />Siva dances with the universe as his theme, he almost lets fall the<br />curtain of illusion, mystifying like Sambara's when soon he reveals<br />the truth to Patanjali, Vyaghrapada and the other rishis, 'This is <br />the<br />illusion of the world as you see it here, and you will now know the<br />eternal truth of the Supreme Brahman, immanent, beginningless,<br />eternal, sentient and blissful, unending and monistic:<br />mandalabhramishu kirnajahnavisikarasnapitachakravalakam<br />bahuvegapavanavapuritakrandadantaradigadrikandaram<br />uddhritaikacharanambujaprabhasrij ?yamanapariveshavigraham<br />utpalodarasahodarambikalochanantavalanaikagocharam sambariyavanikam<br />athakshipan saprapanchamayanartanam sivah drag adarsayata gonikasutam<br />vyaghrapadam itaran rishin api tena te svayam idam jagan mrisha <br />janate<br />sma paramarthatah punah brahma tat param Anadi <br />sachchidanandalakshanam<br />anantam advayam (Patanjalicharita 4. 70-73).</p>
<p>Like a musician, who, during his song, stops for a while, and draws<br />attention to the tala or the rhythm beat, Siva the great dancer,<br />pauses for a while, to sound the drum himself in between, to show the<br />correct adjustment when necessary. Kshemendra describes the patting <br />of<br />the universal lotus by Siva by a play on the world Pushkara, to<br />suggest his beat of the drum tala. The concept is so lofty it makes<br />even mountain meru only a small part of the universal lotus.<br />Sportively the hand of the Lord of Pramathas (Siva) pats the <br />universal<br />lotus, thus signifying the proper musical time beat, the lotus which<br />has the golden Menu mountain as its seed vessel, the twinkling stars<br />as the pollen filaments, the dark moving clouds, the resounding bees,<br />and the vast horizon, the lotus leaves: suvamagirikarnake<br />taralatarakakesare chalajjaladashatpade sphutadigantapatrastrite sa<br />vahpramathanayakah pradisatu sriyarm yatkarah karoti jagadambuje<br />chalitatalalilayitam (Brihatkathamanjari, p. 215, 1).</p>
<p>A sculpture from Rajasthan, actually showing Siva patting the drum as<br />he dances, and a Dakshinamurti from Kalugumalai, playing the drum and<br />acting as Mridanga Dakshinamurti, are excellent examples to <br />illustrate<br />this point.</p>
<p>Siva's fondness for dance, as for music, is clear in the epithets in<br />the Sivasahasranama. He is called Nrityapriya, Nityanritya, Nartana<br />and Sarvasadhaka: nrityapriyo nityanrityo nartanas sarvasadhakah<br />(Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 74)</p>
<p>Siva's epithets based on his love of music and dance are repeated in<br />other Puranas as well. A salutation to Siva is couched entirely in<br />praise of his musical qualities. He is called Nrityasila, meaning <br />that<br />it is his wont to dance, as he is very fond of both orchestral music<br />and dance - Vadyanrityapriya. He is also Gitasila. He always hums a<br />tune and beautiful music at that, sugiti, sugitim gayan ? namostu<br />nrityasilaya vadyanrityapriyaya cha manyave gitasilaya sugitim gayate<br />namah (Vayupurana 24, 142-143).</p>
<p>He is also called Nartanasila, habituated to dance. He is extremely<br />fond of dance and music, both vocal and instrumental, as an offering<br />of worship. His very limbs are composed of music, vocal and<br />instrumental and dance, and he is the beloved of musicians and<br />instrumentalists. He is Silpisa, the lord of musical artist, foremost<br />among the silpis, and the very progenitor of all fine arts,<br />sarvasilpapravartakah: namo nartanasilaya mukhavaditrakarine<br />natyopaharalubdhaya gitavadyarataya cha (Vayupurana 30, 198-199); gitavaditranrityango gitavadanakapriyah (Vayupurana 30, 248).</p>
<p>As he is so fond of dance as offering in worship, it is described as<br />very prominent in ritual. The rishis extol Siva, not only by the <br />chant<br />of the three Vedas - the Rig, Yajus and Sama - but also by dance and<br />music offerings, by the utterance of Pranava, humkara and <br />prostration:<br />archanadibhih omkarahumnamaskarair archayanti sadasivam (Vayupurana<br />54, 6).</p>
<p>Music and dance (Gandharvaveda), being one of the eighteen vidyas, is<br />given a high place, and Siva is its greatest exponent. The greatest<br />masters of dance are, therefore, not only enumerated but described as<br />always in attendance on the trinity ? Brahma, Vishnu and Siva ? who<br />are the three great exponents of dance. Naturally, dance is a great<br />offering for Siva in worship, as he delights in it, and is music and<br />dance personified. The great exponents are not only Brahma, Vishnu,<br />and Siva, but also Indra, Adityas, Rudras, Vasus and scores of other<br />celestials, like Gandharvas, Hamsa, the highest of the Vidyadharas,<br />Haha, Huhu, Brihaspati, Tumburu, Visvavasu and Apsarases, like <br />Menaka,<br />Sahajanya, Parnini, Punjikasthala, Ghritasthala, Ghritachi, Visvachi,<br />Purvachi, Pramlocha, Anumlochanti, Urvasi (Vayupurana 69, 46-51).</p>
<p>It is this aptitude for dances that has given the dance aspect of <br />Siva<br />prominence in his name Nataraja or Nartesvara. He is known as<br />Nartesvara in the north, and the term is actually used in the<br />inscription on the pedestal of one of the most magnificent creations<br />of the Nataraja image in Pala art, from Bharella, near Dacca. He is<br />styled, however, Nrittesvara in Isanavarman's Sambor Prei Kuk<br />inscription from Cambodia. Siva is known as Adavallan in Chola<br />inscriptions, as he excels in dance, and a whole district is called,<br />Nityavinoda, the eternal pleasure of dance of Siva. He dances<br />eternally. That is why he Nityanritya and the embodiment of dance,<br />which explains the name Nartana. He is the only one who can dance <br />both<br />tandava and lasya. Lasya, with the main emphasis on Kaisiki, is best<br />only in feminine performance, but Siva excels even here. That is why<br />he is Sarvasadhaka. He can, in his form shows the violent mode of<br />dance, the other portrays the softer part of it. Siva, however, is<br />handicapped by the fact that there is nothing in the world beyond <br />him,<br />as his immanence precludes his existence beyond it, and dance is a<br />portrayal of the three worlds. But even in rendering himself, Siva<br />excels. Siva's dance is only the dance rendering of himself, there<br />being nothing in the three worlds, apart from him, which would answer<br />trailokyanukriti. That is why Ratnakara sings the glory of Siva, 'O <br />my<br />Lord Sankara, you, who in your immanence, exist by encompassing the<br />entire universe, mobile and immobile, only rendering yourself as you<br />dance on all the nights, elaborate the modes of karanas and angaharas<br />and their usage: karanangaharavidhibhis savistarais sakalasu sankara<br />nisasu nrityata kriyate tvaya vikritir atmano vibho sacharacharam<br />jagad avapya tasthushah (Haravijaya 6. 180).</p>
<p>Siva being hermaphrodite has the unique opportunity to combine rasas<br />in a special bhavasabalata. He thus obviates the necessity to <br />restrict<br />himself to only sringara or raudra. As lasya has sringara as its main<br />theme, and tandava, raudra, Siva combines both, and illustrates these<br />two major rasas, a very difficult process indeed, as difficult or<br />performance as of comprehension by an audience. As Patanjali <br />tellingly<br />puts it elsewhere that the pupil was Indra and the teacher <br />Brihaspati,<br />Siva himself is here the dancer, and the audience the rest of the<br />great gods. A beautiful description of Siva's classical beauty as<br />Ardhanarisvara, is given in the copper-plate of Dharmapala of<br />Pragjyotisha, where the primal god, the Lord of half a youthful<br />damsel, poses with ear lobes decorated with a blue lotus in one and<br />the gems on the serpent hood on the other, and with the torso<br />symmetrically divided by the high full feminine breast tinged with<br />fragrant crimson, the masculine half ash-smeared, as if it were the<br />commingling of the two flavours, sringara and raudra: vande tam<br />ardhayuvatisvaram adidevam indivaroragaphanamanikarnapuram<br />uttungapinakuchakunkumabhasmabhinnam srihagararaudrarasayor iva <br />sargam<br />ekam (Epigraph. Ind. 30, p. 205).</p>
<p>Siva is not only the Lord of tandava and lasya in both varieties of<br />nritta and nritya, but he is also the Lord of natya. He is the actor<br />on the world stage, the Mahasailusha, as he is known and called<br />sometimes. He is styled Natakesvara in the Prasat Ta Keo inscription<br />of Suryavarman from Cambodia. Even here one the stage, in following<br />the dialogue and theme of a nataka, the actor has to follow the<br />principles of nritya, and by the language of gesture convey the sense<br />of the text of the drama as the actor. There are elaborate <br />injunctions<br />as to how a drisya kavya, like the nataka, has to be indicated by<br />dance or nritya and abhinaya. The stage directions in Raghavabhatta's<br />commentary, Arthadyotanika on Abhijnanasakuntalam, would make this<br />very clear. Coomaraswamy has illustrated a few points in his<br />introduction to the Mirror of Gesture, the nalina-padmakosa hands,<br />palms downwards, for watering of a tree, moving the head quickly to<br />and fro, vidhuta, lips quivering, hands in pataka unsteadily against<br />the face to show fear of a bee, and so for the (Mirror of Gesture, <br />pp.<br />4-5). It is this mystery of Siva's dance and association of Siva as<br />tutelary deity of Natya that accounts for the mention of several<br />presentations of innumerable danseuses to Siva temples in India and <br />in<br />other parts of South East Asia. The classical instance is the gift of<br />four hundred dancing girls to the temple of the Lord of dance,<br />Adavallan, in the shrine of Rajarajesvara at Tanjavur, with recorded<br />elaborate provision for their maintenance provided by the emperor<br />Rajaraja. The Badaun inscription of Lakhanapala mentions how, dance<br />forming a vital and vivid part of temple worship ritual, the ascetic<br />rajaguru Isanasiva caused adequate provision to be made for this<br />perpetual daily worship. The world would be wonderstruck at the<br />elaborate details of the great worship, causing almost a holy<br />giddiness, with the utmost praise propitiating the Beloved of the<br />Mountain-princes in daily ritual, the danseuses dancing, scattering<br />flowers to the sound of music of the orchestra, heightened by the<br />sweet sound of the lute, like the hum of the bees, drowned by the<br />clang of the temple bells in action: turyanam sanninadair<br />madhukaramadhurair vallakisphitagitair ghantasamghattaghoshaih<br />kusumaparimalair nartanair nartakinam yasminnatyantabhaktya mahati<br />girisutavallabham nityaritya bhrantih pavitriki syad<br />atibahalamahapujaya vismitanam (Epigraph. Ind. 1, p. 66).</p>
<p>In a copper plate of Prabhutavarsha, the temple ritual, including<br />elaborate offering of dance by danseuses, is mentioned. The poet of<br />the inscription shows how the audience in the temple was so<br />appreciative that it was captivated by the excellence of the<br />performance. The temple of Kannesvara, where the young women of the<br />city were enthralled by the dances of moon-faced girls, skilled in<br />gestures, indicated by their sprout-like hands, conveying their<br />sentiments and their emotions at the time of the dhupa, is a passage<br />of importance, showing how in medieval India, the Lord of dance was<br />propitiated by appropriate provision of danseuses in temples:<br />dhumavelalilagatavilasinijananam<br />karatalakisalayarasabhava-<br />sadbhavaprakatanakusalasasivadananganarnartanahrita-<br />paurayuvatijanachittantaram<br />(Epigraph, Ind. 1, p. 305).</p>
<p>An early Eastern Ganga inscription of Aniyanka Bhima, from<br />Bhubanesvar, incised in the Svapnesvara temple, gives a sparkling<br />vision painted in words of the danseuses, presented to Tripurahara<br />Siva Svapnesvara, whose moving side-long glances are spells to<br />captivate the universe, whose footsteps in dance still the motion of<br />all the denizens of the three worlds, whose germ-set bracelets shoot<br />froth the illumination of a thousand lamps without effort, at the<br />commencement of their dance: yasminnetranchalataralima<br />visvavasyaikamantrah padanyasas tribhubanagatistambhanam samvidhatte<br />nrityarambhe valayamanibhir nirmitaratnadipas tasmai dattas<br />tripurajayine tena tasta mrigakshyah (Epigraph. Ind. 6, p. 202).</p>
<p>Siva being the main source of dance, interpretation of karanas and<br />angaharas, created by Vishnu by his movements as he engaged Madhu and<br />Kaitabha in battle, have been the main source of inspiration for the<br />entire text on the dance forms by Bharata and others. The Natyasastra<br />clearly says that Bharata prepared the text, based mainly on what he<br />saw as the interpretation of rechakas, karanas and angaharas, as Siva<br />danced and, by word of mouth, explained their nuances: rechakair<br />angaharais cha nrityantam vikshya sankaram ityapi bruvata spashtam <br />tad<br />eva munina kritam (Natyasastra 4.257).</p>
<p>The dance of Siva, both as a sight for the eyes to experience and for<br />the ears to hear, in regard to the rhythmic tap of the feet, in<br />consonance with the orchestral sound, are picturesquely presented as<br />it were, one by Dhanapala and the other by Trivikrama. Dhanapala<br />imagines a battle array, with thousands of flags fluttering, swayed <br />by<br />blasts of wild wind, appearing like the tandava dance of Siva:<br />sakhandaparasutandava iva prachandaniladhutadhvajasahasraih<br />(Tilakamanjari 2, p. 203). Dhanapala is very fond of Kanchi and the<br />south. He is surely recalling the innumerable flames, like flags on<br />the mandala around Nataraja, a peculiar feature in the south in the<br />representation of the dancing Siva. In the line previous to this, he<br />refers to flame weapons exactly like these, like the flash of <br />lighting<br />fast approaching sakti weapons, all a flame. This effect of<br />innumerable flames, as in a battlefield, suggests not only a normal<br />pleasureable dance but something more, the dance of victory on the<br />battlefield, where the greatest opponents, like the Tripuras, are<br />overcome by the dark flames as weapons. The play of flames in<br />Tripurasamhara is itself very picturesquely painted in a famous verse<br />where bhayanaka, raudra and sringara are commingled. May the flames<br />from the darts of Siva destroy all evil, flames, that like a <br />faithless<br />lover caught erring, are discarded by the youthful tear-stained<br />lotus-eyed damsels from the seraglio of the Tripuras, thrown aside,<br />caught on their hand, violently shaken as they pulled at the hem of<br />the garments, flung aside as they caught their dresses, not even<br />observed in their embarrassment, even when fallen at their feet,<br />shaken off as they tried to embrace and envelop them: kshipto<br />hastavalagnah prasabham abhihato pyadadanomsukantam grihnan<br />keseshvapastas charananipatito nekshitas sambhramena alingan<br />yovadhutas tripurayuvatibhis sasrunetrotpalabhih kamivardraparadhas <br />sa<br />dhaatu duritam sambhavo vas saragnih (Amar-ukam 2).</p>
<p>Even the arrow of Siva is described as dancing, particularly that of<br />Tripurantaka. It is very appropriate because the arrow of Siva is <br />made<br />up of both Agni and Vishnu. The flame of fire is a great dancer,<br />indeed, and Vishnu created the lovely vrittis which constitute the<br />element of charm in dance. Like Brahma and Siva, Vishnu is also a<br />great acharya or preceptor of dance. The verse of Vaidya Gadadhara is<br />a picturesque description of Tripurantaka's arrow as a dancer. The<br />flame of arrow performs the tandava dance, removing the enveloping<br />curtain of smoke for entering the stage, scatters a handful of <br />flowers<br />in the guise of sparks of fire all over, and lightly stepping on the<br />wide expanse of the mansions of the three cities, created by Maya,<br />completely envelopes the aspect of the emotion of terror, multiplying<br />in all directions: vishvag vyadhuya dhumaprachayayavanikam<br />sphayamanasphulingavyajad akirya pushpanjalim upari padam nyasyato<br />mandiranam svachchandabhogasima mahati mayapure<br />dattaraudrangaragavyaptaseshasya visvesvarasarasikhinas tandavam nah<br />punatu (Saduktikarnamritam, p. 23, 78).</p>
<p>The sound of Siva's dance steps also again recalling the rhythm in<br />martial music is conceived in equality picturesque fashion, where<br />Trivikrama compares the tap sound of Siva's dance steps to that of <br />the<br />hoofs of the horse on the move, appearing to exercise themselves in<br />the technique of Siva's dance steps themselves:<br />chatulakhuracharipracharenadambaritatandavasya khandaparasoh <br />padalilam<br />iva' bhyasyata?.jatyataraturagasainyena parivritah (Nalachampu 6. pp.<br />373-74).</p>
<p>A Kakatiya inscription gives exactly the same simulation of Siva's<br />dance steps to similar tap of the hoofs of the equestrian regiment<br />marching forth to battle.</p>
<p>In early Tamil literature, there is elaborate description of Siva's<br />martial dance. Siva as Dakshinamurti, Gangadhara, Kalikatandava,<br />Vinadhara, Tripurantaka, Gajantaka, Brahmasiraschhetta, is fused in<br />the concept of the dancing Siva in the company of Devi, the witness o<br />his dance, who keeps time and applauds, in the invocation to the <br />early<br />Tamil poem kalittokai. Here Siva, who taught the Vedas and Vedangas <br />to<br />the seers, scattered fire on the Tripuras, contested in dance with<br />Kali, created music from his drum, is described as dancing, in his <br />joy<br />of victory, the Kotti, Pandaranga and Kapala dances, eight-armed,<br />wearing the tiger skin and with the skull of Brahma in his hand, as<br />Devi of lovely form, with attenuated waist, drooping shoulders and<br />perfumed locks, attracting bees, watches the time beat: aru ari<br />antanarkku aru marai pala pakarntu teru nir chataik karantu tirupuram<br />timatuttu karamal kurittatan mel chellum katun kuli marap por mani<br />mitarru en kaiyay kel in patuparai pala iyampa pal uruvam peyarttu ni<br />kotikotti atunkai kotu uyar akal alkul koti purai nuchuppinai konta<br />chir taruvalo mantu amar pala katantu matukaiyal niru anintu<br />pantarankarm atumkai panai elil anai men tol vantu ararrum kuntalai<br />valar tukkut taruvalo kolai uluvait tol achaii konraittar chuvar<br />purala talai ankai kontu ni kapalam atumkal mulai aninta muruvalal<br />munpanitaruvalo paniyum tukkum chirun enru ivai man ilai arival kappa<br />anam il poru! emakku amarntanai ati (History of Tamil Literature p.<br />154).</p>
<p>In fact, Siva's dance in several instances is the dance of victory.<br />There is a very early yupa inscription from Nandsa, near Udaipur,<br />mentioning the dance of victory. The word used is Jayanartana. This<br />auspicious name of king, very appropriately chosen, assures prowess <br />to<br />a prince as soon as he is born. Jayanartana can be the name of no<br />other than Siva himself, who danced the Tripurasamhara and <br />Gajasamhara<br />dance: jayanartanaprabhavardhanapautrasya jayasomaputrasya sominetus<br />srisomasya (Epigraph. Ind. 27, p. 263).</p>
<p>Jaya in describing dance closely correlates it with warfare and <br />points<br />out how mandalas, angaharas and music are essentials in both. A wise<br />one should utilise in warfare, as well as in regular dance, the<br />different mandalas in their varieties, as well as pleasing angaharas<br />that captivate the mind, to the accompaniment of music: etani<br />khandasahitanyapi mandalani lilangayashtimadhurani manoharani<br />vadyanugani vivadhani budho niyuddhe yuddhetha naratanavidhau <br />vidhivad<br />vidadhyat (Nrittaratnavali 3. 197).</p>
<p>Jaya, the Commander of the armed forces of the Kakatiyas, who was<br />himself an adept in fine arts, particularly, music and dance, besides<br />being a poet, fancies Siva the Lord of dance, as they very embodiment<br />of nritya. He, therefore, by a play on words, brings together the<br />names of all the karanas, at the same time describing a situation of<br />Siva in dance, with his foot resounding with the anklet slipped on it<br />by Parvati, bending forward to embrace him, with his hand holding the<br />leaping deer, entwined by the quivering snake, joyously raising his<br />knee in sport, to gently move aside the Nandi bull, come very close <br />to<br />him. Siva, the lord of the daughter of the mountain, looks the very<br />embodiment of dance karanas, like valitoru, vartita, akshipta, <br />nupura,<br />kranta, harinapluta, bhujanganchita, parsvakranta, apaviddha,<br />vrishabhakrida, urdhvajanu and the rest:<br />aslishyadvalitoruvarttitasivak-shiptasphurannupurakrantamghrim<br />harinaplutasrayakaram chanchadbhujanganchitam<br />parsvakrantapadapaviddhavrishabhakridordhvajanutsukamvyachashte<br />karanaugham adritanayakantopamam jayanah (Nrittaratnavali 4.1).</p>
<p>In describing a situation like the dire need of the Devas to master a<br />precious text of dancing by a specialist like Nandikesvara in order <br />to<br />overcome a great dancer representing the Daityas, the appellation<br />given even to him is Natasekhara. Indra request Nandikesvara to<br />acquaint him with Bharatarnava so that he could triumph over<br />Natasekhara. Natasekhara means 'the crest jewel among dancers'. It is<br />not very different from the appellation Nataraja. In the Sivapurana,<br />Bana, the great devotes of Siva, is described as dancing his best to<br />please Siva who is never so overjoyed as when he listens to Sama <br />music<br />and witnesses the best of dance. The story of Ravana, chanting the<br />Sama hymns in musical notes to please Siva and get released from <br />under<br />the Kailasa mountain where he got trapped by his own overweaning<br />pride, when he tried to shake the mighty mountain, is only too well<br />known.</p>
<p>Music and dance can never be separated. In fact, sangita includes<br />music, both vocal and instrumental, and dance. There is very early<br />mention of all these as silpa (Kausitaki Brahmana 29.5). That is why<br />Siva is sometimes represented as the Lord of music with the lute and<br />sometimes as a dancer carrying the lute. He also occasionally plays<br />the drum independently, as the musical Dakshinamurti, or sounds the<br />drum dancing as Nataraja. When Kalidasa says sangitaya <br />prahatamurajah-<br />sangita means not only instrumental and vocal music, atodya and gita,<br />but also nritya or dance. By dance has to be understood not only pure<br />nritta, composed of tala and laya, but also nritya which expounds the<br />text of the song through abhinaya. This brings into the scene<br />literature. The sculpturesque position in dance and the beautiful<br />situations in the stances of angaharas and karanas, where the body<br />beautiful looks much more so by the flexions, completely draws in the<br />art of chitra, sculpture and painting, which give a permanent vision<br />of fleeting, charming situations in dance. That is why Siva, as<br />Vinadhara Dakshinamurti and as Nataraja, along with Vyakhyana<br />Dakshinamurti, go together. Even in dance, it is not any theme that <br />is<br />favoured so much as a worthy theme, like the Tripurasamhara, which is<br />the greatest heroic episode appealing at once to literature, art,<br />music and dance: tripuravijayo giyate kinnaribhih (Meghaduta 1.58).<br />Tradition also has it that the first performance to popularise natya<br />among the gods was Tripuravijaya, witnessed and appreciated by Siva<br />himself. A very important early terracotta of the Sunga period,<br />representing Siva as Vina Dakshinamurti, emphasises the sangita <br />aspect<br />of Siva and in mute eloquence describes him as the teacher of music,<br />vocal and instrumental, and dance. Centuries later, was created the<br />more developed, charming, rate iconographic figure of Siva, as<br />Saptasvaramaya. Siva from Parel is a form multiplied into seven to<br />represent the personified musical notes, nishada, rishabha, gandhara,<br />shadja, madhyama and dhaivata. The Ganas themselves are shown at the<br />feet, on either side, playing the four varieties of musical<br />instruments that compose the atodya, the stringed, tata, including <br />the<br />harp, lute and other vina-like instruments, the anaddha like <br />mridanga,<br />muraja, pushkara and other varieties of drum, belonging to the<br />percussion class, the sushira variety of wind instruments, like the<br />flute and others, and the ghana, or clanging metallic cymbals and<br />others of that type, both large and small. There can be no mistaking<br />the intent of the Vakataka sculptor who has portrayed the musical <br />Siva<br />at Parel. It is one of the gems of Vakataka art. The theme of<br />Bhutaganas playing musical instruments as orchestral accompaniment to<br />Siva's dance is a great favourite in literature as in art and in the<br />Tevaram hymns of the early Tamil saints there are pictures conjured<br />up, as by Tirujnanasambanda, who has Siva or Alankador, with the<br />crescent moon, the mighty stream of Ganga in his locks, dancing, as<br />many Vedic chants are accompanied by the play of drum, flute and harp<br />by the Bhutaganas: paraiyunchirukkulalum yalumputam payirrave <br />maraiyum<br />palapati mayanattiraiya maintanar piraiyumperumpunalcher <br />chataiyinarum<br />(Tevarattirupatikam 45.6).</p>
<p>As the drum precedes the other musical instruments, both for music <br />and<br />for dance, the sounding of it by Nandi at the commencement of Siva's<br />dance becomes a favourite theme in literary descriptions. Mayura has<br />an interesting allusion to it. He compares it to the pranava or <br />omkara<br />at the commencement of Vedic chant. The sound of the Nandi drum by<br />Nandi at the start of the evening dance of the foe of Madana (Siva),<br />is like the first blast of winds in the season of laden clouds, like<br />smoke before fire, like the first created (water) in the universe,<br />like the sacred Om for the mass of Vedic literature, the son of<br />Vinata, i.e. Aruna at the front of the vehicle of Surya: paurastyas<br />toyadartoh Pavana iva pavan pavakasyeva dhumo visvasyevadisargo<br />pranava ive param pavano vedaraseh sandhyanrityotsavechchhor iva<br />madanaripor nandinandininadas saurasyagre sukham vo vitaratu<br />vinatanandanas syandanasya (Mayurasataka, 55).</p>
<p>Siva being the most auspicious, the orchestra itself, composed of<br />vina, venu and mridanga, in turn serve the purpose of the great dance<br />master, and are thus auspicious. Ratnakara records the ancient belief<br />that the musical orchestra is a remover of visha or poison. Siva as<br />the greatest of physicians, bhishaktama among the bhishajas, the<br />greatest among the physicians, as the Veda would have it, is the <br />great<br />God who swallowed the deadliest poison, kalakuta. Naturally, Siva's<br />orchestra of vina, venu and mridanga, can be held to be consecrated <br />by<br />mantra and remove all visha or poison. The general belief that<br />consecrated musical instruments remove poison is thus voiced by<br />Ratnakara: prastauti mantrakritasamskritirupavenuvinaravopi <br />vishamasya<br />vishasya nasam (Haravijaya 16, 9). The learned commentator gives the<br />authority for this belief: mantrena kritasamskaram rupam yasya <br />vinades<br />tadiyo ravo visham nasayati; yad<br />uktam-'vinavenumridangadarpanataleshvaropitah kichako dashtanam<br />vishapankalepam achirad dhyatas samutpumsayer' iti.</p>
<p>Kalidasa conceives of a magnificent natural orchestra for Siva, with<br />nor artificial instrument, but natural elements themselves combining<br />to produce the effect of the four instruments composing atodya. <br />Filled<br />with wind, the bamboos sound sweet with the effect of venu (flute),<br />the resounding thunder of the cloud gives the effect of the noble <br />note<br />of the muraja drum, as vocal music is supplied by the sweet-throated<br />Kinnaris, singing in passionate earnestness the great theme of Siva's<br />triumph over the Tripuras. Kalidasa feels that this would complete <br />the<br />musical background for Pasupati's dance: sabdayante madhuram anilaih<br />kichakash puryamanas samraktabhis tripuravijayo giyate kinnaribhih<br />nirhradas te muraja iva chet kandareshu dhvanis syat sangitartho nanu<br />pasupates tatra bhavi samagrah (Meghaduta 1.56).</p>
<p>So stupendous is the concept of the Lord of dance, Nataraja, so<br />completely enveloping the universe, in which and as which he dances,<br />an impossible situation indeed, where he is both the container and <br />the<br />contained, that his adoration through dance and music, which is <br />itself<br />part of temple ritual, is likened to lighting up the sun with a <br />flame.<br />Sudraka laughs at this idea of adoring Siva, the Lord of dance, by<br />dance and music, as this is not different from the worship of the sun<br />by waving the lamp before him, or the ocean by offering a handful of<br />water, or Vasanta, the god of spring, by a scatter of blooming<br />flowers, which is all the same as the adoration of the Lord of <br />letters<br />by utterances: suryam yajanti dipais samudram adbhir vasantam api<br />pushpaih archamo bhagavantam vayam api vagisvaram vagbhih<br />(Padmaprabhritaka 11).</p>
<p>What is meant here is music, and sangita necessarily brings in dance<br />also, which is an offering to Siva Dakshinamurti, who is also a <br />dancer<br />carrying the vina, symbolising music and dance. This idea closely<br />follows the hymn from the Upanishad, na tatra suryo bhati na<br />chandratarakam nema vidyuto bhanti kutoyam agnih tam eva bhantam<br />anubhati sarvam tasya bhasa sarvam idam vibhati. The ideas of Siva<br />about dance are manifest or unmanifest as there is no knowledge of<br />dance or music or any other art of science apart from him. That is<br />why, while appreciating the performance of Samudramathana and<br />Tripuradaha by the celestials, Siva tells Bharata that he had also<br />been often contemplating as he danced in the evenings, on the beauty<br />of natya as he now witnessed it. He himself however had preference <br />for<br />nritta in the charming Kaisiki mode. With an admixture of the<br />perfection of nritta with its angaharas and karanas, as taught to him<br />by Tandu at the instance of Siva, Bharata improved his natya.</p>
<p>The<br />ancients visualised Nataraja as a manifestation of the cosmic energy<br />symbolising the three aspects of creation, preservation and<br />destruction. The dance of Nataraja has always been synonymously <br />viewed<br />with truth and beauty, force and rhythm, movement and change,<br />realisation and dissolution. Nataraja has been visualised in variety<br />of forms by seers, poets and artists- chiselled, painted, described<br />and sung about in many parts of India and countries in the<br />neighbourhood since long. This itself is a testimony to the twin<br />aspects of time and timelessness of Nataraja,both as a personality <br />and<br />as a theme. This book highlights Nataraja as the presiding deity of<br />fine arts whether it be music, dance, painting, sculpture or<br />epigraphy. The Vedic roots of the cosmic dancer and the blend of<br />tradition and modernity is woven as a thread throughout the book<br />describing vividly the exploits of the great dancer on world stage. <br />It<br />also contains interesting information on famous spots of the Nataraja<br />theme and the concept of Nataraja beyond Indian frontiers.</p>

<p>you yourself have quoted so many links between the big temple and <br />thillai.<br />the cholas crowned themselves symbolically in chidambaram. they had <br />to sit on the siver panchaatchara steps have an abishekam and then <br />move to the 1000 pillared hall where the chief dhikshitar crowned <br />them on behalf of nataraja.<br />chidambaram was the defacto capital of rajendra when he built <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym .<br />his star too was margali thiruvathirai.<br />he chose <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  because floods in the kolidam prevented him from going <br />to a chidambaram temple festival.<br />kulothunga (?) threw govinda raja into the sea rvoving al competition <br />to natraja.the last event is however disputed.</acronym></acronym></p>

<p>this is the popular contention - with regard to especially the <br />depiction of the orb around him etc. the very mention of bronze and <br />chola bronzes in particular - we get to see them credited with this <br />image.</p>

<blockquote><p>  hi sps sir,</p>
<p>  we are told often that the nataraja form is a creation of the chola <br />  empire - though the form does feature much earlier, it was under <br />  them that it was cast in bronze and accquired its current <br />  definition. this is a spendid book ( more a penance)....some <br />  excerpts...</p>
<p>  NATARAJA ? THE LORD OF DANCE<br />  C.Sivaramamurti</p>
<p>  The composer of an inscription has said, and probably, in a normal<br />  sense, rightly, that dance in the darkness is an impossibility. Let<br />  kings compose hundreds of mellifluous poems, or chum up hosts of <br />foes<br />  on the battlefield, or scatter their wealth on deserving donees, but<br />  with the passage of time all these their exploits would be like<br />  dancing in utter darkness if these were not recorded by poets in<br />  prasastis: kurvantu kirtanasatani rananganeshu mathnantu <br />vairinikaram<br />  dhanam utsrijantu kalanatare tad akhilam prabalandhakaranrityopamam<br />  kavijanair anibaddhyamanam (Epigraph. Ind. 27, p. 281).</p>
<p>  Dance in the darkness is no doubt unimaginable. But, Siva only <br />  chooses<br />  the evening for his dance, when it is dark, but the darkness is lit <br />  up<br />  by his own effulgence, the moon on his crest, the stars around, the<br />  flame in his hand, and the powerful rays shooting forth from the <br />gems<br />  on the hoods of snakes he wears as his ornaments. This is abundantly<br />  illustrated in literature, as stated elsewhere, to show how Siva<br />  requires not a powerful light focussed on him, but the mild and soft<br />  tone of moonlight, chosen to reveal not too luridly, but softly and<br />  gracefully, the movement of his limbs.</p>
<p>  Siva's dance cannot be comprehended by lesser masters. It is only <br />the<br />  great ones like Brahma, Bharata, Hari, Narada or Skanda who can<br />  understand or appreciate his dance. An inscription on the cave <br />temple<br />  at Saluvankuppam has a verse to elucidate not only the distinction <br />of<br />  Siva's dance, but also to enumerate the great celestial exponents of<br />  natya and sangita and their ability, as the right audience, to<br />  appreciate Siva's dance: yadi na vidhata bharato yadi na harir <br />narado<br />  na va skandha boddhum ka iva samarthas sangitam kalakalasya <br />  (Epigraph.<br />  Ind. 10, p. 12). The word used here sangita includes music, both <br />  vocal<br />  and instrumental, and dance. Poetry, music, literature and dance are<br />  time arts, while painting, sculpture and architecture are space arts<br />  (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition. Vol. X). The word Kalakala,<br />  emphasizing the concept of time and eternity of Siva, appropriately<br />  makes him the master of sangita, including music and dance. <br />Ratnakara<br />  goes one step further, when he describes even elements like water,<br />  personified in the heavenly stream, Ganga, on his head, applauding, <br />  as<br />  he imagines, his excellence in dance. Siva's dance movements, <br />wherein<br />  the excels, are loudly applauded it would seem by the deep rumbling<br />  sound of the waves of the heavenly stream entering the hollows of <br />the<br />  garland of skulls on his head:<br />  kukshipravishtasuranir-jharinitarangajhankarataraninadair<br />  nrikapalapanktih nritsatisayasvamandam (Haravijaya 2.57).</p>
<p>  It is not only these great gods and goddesses, the creators each in<br />  his or her own important way, that are the witnesses to applaud the<br />  dance of Siva, but they enthusiastically also join in creating the<br />  orchestra for him, by playing the musical instruments. At the very<br />  sign of his brow, Vishnu takes up the drum mardala, which, with is<br />  noble rumbling notes, like the cloud inspiring the blue-throated<br />  peacock to dance, starts the musical sound. With his louts hand,<br />  Brahma takes up a pair of cymbals, ostensibly to keep time to the<br />  dance of the victor of Kama, but really because they allow his<br />  mistaking them for the breasts of his consort, Sarasvati. Indra <br />  places<br />  the bamboo flute on his lip, the honey of which was lovingly tested <br />  by<br />  the celestial nymph, Rambha, and even by the excellence of his<br />  playing, which keeps the worlds spell-bound, Indra makes himself<br />  conspicuous in his high station. Sarasvati, the consort of Brahma,<br />  beautifully plays the lute with the rosary placed on her left ear, <br />as<br />  if to suggest a faster pace in the musical play. Parvati smiles at <br />  the<br />  impatience of her beloved one (Siva) to dance, as he gets ready by<br />  tying up his locks with the long snake coil and his waist with the<br />  elephant hide. Sambhu, the kind-hearted, knowing that his dance<br />  festival was not to be comprehended by the mortal eye, graciously<br />  bestows divine sight for those who lack it. Then the whole concourse<br />  witnesses the dance of Siva, with the locks whirling around and<br />  lashing clusters of stars, as his feet with the serpent anklet,<br />  jingling at his tread, pushes down the earth: tatra<br />  sankarakatakshachoditas charumardalam avadayaddharih yah payoda iti<br />  pushkarasrito nilakanthanatanochitadhvanih kamajinnatanakaranena va<br />  bharatikuchayugabhramena va tatra talayugalim athadade<br />  panipankajayugena padmabhuh rambhaya hritarase radachchhade <br />  vamsanalam<br />  avasajya vasavah vadanad api vimohayan janan adade kila na<br />  vasavasthitam vadaya drutam itiva samsata sphatikakshavalayena<br />  dakshine asrita sravasi charuvallakivadanam vyatanute Priya vidheh<br />  ayatena phanina jatabharam madhyabhagam ibhacharmakakshyaya <br />badhnatah<br />  priyatamasya nartitum vikshya sambhramam uma smitam vyadhat<br />  vikshanochitam apamsachakshusha nartanotsavam avekshitum nijam<br />  sambhuna sakaladehinam tada divyam akshi didise dayaluna sandadarsa<br />  sapadi bhramajjatataditoduputalam tada janah<br />  vyalanupuraranatpadarpananyanchitaksshiti natesanartanam<br />  (Patanjalicharita 4. 61-67).</p>
<p>  As Siva commences his dance in the evening. Ratnakara imagines, in <br />  the<br />  loftiest terms the sun and moons as the cymbals used by the goddess <br />  of<br />  prosperity herself for tala and laya, the most important in the <br />  nritta<br />  aspect of dance. At the commencement of dance by Siva at dusk, with<br />  the sun disc setting near the astagiri and the full moon emerging <br />  into<br />  light from his locks, it seems to make the celestial goddess of<br />  prosperity hold as it were these two as cymbals for the Lord's <br />  musical<br />  orchestra: <br />  astavalambiravibimbitayodayadsrichudonmishatsakalachandrataya<br />  cha sayam sandhyapranrittaharavadyagrihitakamsyataladvayeva<br />  samalakshyata nakalakshmih (Haravijya 19.5).</p>
<p>  This exacting musical orchestra, the vina played by the Lady of <br />  music,<br />  Sarasvati herself, the flute by Indra who excels, Brahma keeping <br />time<br />  and Vishnu himself sounding the drum, is because Siva himself is an<br />  adept in all the musical instruments. In the Sivasahasranama, there <br />  is<br />  an elaboration of his musical accomplishments. He is described as<br />  Sarvaturyaninadi, he is also Vainavi, Panavi, Vini, Tali and Nali:<br />  vainavi panavi kalah kalakanthah katamkatah?.. vini cha panavi tali<br />  nail kalikatus tatha sarvaturyaninadi cha sarvavyuapyaparigrahah<br />  (Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 11) tumbuvino mahakopah vamsavadi <br />hyaninditah<br />  (Linegamahapurana 1, 65, 21) naikatanaratas svarah (Lingamahapurana <br />  1,<br />  65, 40). The commentary here explains tumbu vina as the vina <br />provided<br />  with two gourds and popularly known as Rudra vina. Siva delights in<br />  innumerable murchhanas or tanas, and he is of the very nature of the<br />  svaras, not only udatta, anudatta, svarita, but the sangita svaras,<br />  the seven famous notes. Siva is also called Rathagita: akshayo<br />  rathagitas cha (Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 44). Ratha is Rathantarasama,<br />  by the chant of which he is invoked. Siva's fondness for Sama is <br />very<br />  well known.</p>
<p>  associated with several rishis, like Patanjali, Vyaghrapada, <br />Agastya,<br />  Durvasa, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana, Sanatkumara, and others.<br />  Ramabhadra Dikshita gives a graphic description of the rasied foot <br />of<br />  Siva in his bhujangatrasita mode of dance at Chidambaram. Siva's<br />  performance of karanas, making up angaharas, which go along with his<br />  whirling movements in forming mandalas, scatters a spray of water <br />  from<br />  the heavenly stream on his head, bathing and purifying, as it were,<br />  the entire space around, packed with spectators. The rapid swirl of<br />  his arms raises blasts, resounding in the caverns of the mountains <br />of<br />  the quarters, while the light form his raised lotus foot, creates a<br />  halo of light around him, fully observed only by the side-long <br />  glances<br />  of Devi, whose dark eyes are twins it would seem of the blue lotus. <br />  As<br />  Siva dances with the universe as his theme, he almost lets fall the<br />  curtain of illusion, mystifying like Sambara's when soon he reveals<br />  the truth to Patanjali, Vyaghrapada and the other rishis, 'This is <br />  the<br />  illusion of the world as you see it here, and you will now know the<br />  eternal truth of the Supreme Brahman, immanent, beginningless,<br />  eternal, sentient and blissful, unending and monistic:<br />  mandalabhramishu kirnajahnavisikarasnapitachakravalakam<br />  bahuvegapavanavapuritakrandadantaradigadrikandaram<br />  uddhritaikacharanambujaprabhasrij ?yamanapariveshavigraham<br />  utpalodarasahodarambikalochanantavalanaikagocharam sambariyavanikam<br />  athakshipan saprapanchamayanartanam sivah drag adarsayata <br />gonikasutam<br />  vyaghrapadam itaran rishin api tena te svayam idam jagan mrisha <br />  janate<br />  sma paramarthatah punah brahma tat param Anadi <br />  sachchidanandalakshanam<br />  anantam advayam (Patanjalicharita 4. 70-73).</p>
<p>  Like a musician, who, during his song, stops for a while, and draws<br />  attention to the tala or the rhythm beat, Siva the great dancer,<br />  pauses for a while, to sound the drum himself in between, to show <br />the<br />  correct adjustment when necessary. Kshemendra describes the patting <br />  of<br />  the universal lotus by Siva by a play on the world Pushkara, to<br />  suggest his beat of the drum tala. The concept is so lofty it makes<br />  even mountain meru only a small part of the universal lotus.<br />  Sportively the hand of the Lord of Pramathas (Siva) pats the <br />  universal<br />  lotus, thus signifying the proper musical time beat, the lotus which<br />  has the golden Menu mountain as its seed vessel, the twinkling stars<br />  as the pollen filaments, the dark moving clouds, the resounding <br />bees,<br />  and the vast horizon, the lotus leaves: suvamagirikarnake<br />  taralatarakakesare chalajjaladashatpade sphutadigantapatrastrite sa<br />  vahpramathanayakah pradisatu sriyarm yatkarah karoti jagadambuje<br />  chalitatalalilayitam (Brihatkathamanjari, p. 215, 1).</p>
<p>  A sculpture from Rajasthan, actually showing Siva patting the drum <br />as<br />  he dances, and a Dakshinamurti from Kalugumalai, playing the drum <br />and<br />  acting as Mridanga Dakshinamurti, are excellent examples to <br />  illustrate<br />  this point.</p>
<p>  Siva's fondness for dance, as for music, is clear in the epithets in<br />  the Sivasahasranama. He is called Nrityapriya, Nityanritya, Nartana<br />  and Sarvasadhaka: nrityapriyo nityanrityo nartanas sarvasadhakah<br />  (Lingamahapurana 1, 65, 74)</p>
<p>  Siva's epithets based on his love of music and dance are repeated in<br />  other Puranas as well. A salutation to Siva is couched entirely in<br />  praise of his musical qualities. He is called Nrityasila, meaning <br />  that<br />  it is his wont to dance, as he is very fond of both orchestral music<br />  and dance - Vadyanrityapriya. He is also Gitasila. He always hums a<br />  tune and beautiful music at that, sugiti, sugitim gayan ? namostu<br />  nrityasilaya vadyanrityapriyaya cha manyave gitasilaya sugitim <br />gayate<br />  namah (Vayupurana 24, 142-143).</p>
<p>  He is also called Nartanasila, habituated to dance. He is extremely<br />  fond of dance and music, both vocal and instrumental, as an offering<br />  of worship. His very limbs are composed of music, vocal and<br />  instrumental and dance, and he is the beloved of musicians and<br />  instrumentalists. He is Silpisa, the lord of musical artist, <br />foremost<br />  among the silpis, and the very progenitor of all fine arts,<br />  sarvasilpapravartakah: namo nartanasilaya mukhavaditrakarine<br />  natyopaharalubdhaya gitavadyarataya cha (Vayupurana 30, 198-199);   gitavaditranrityango gitavadanakapriyah (Vayupurana 30, 248).</p>
<p>  As he is so fond of dance as offering in worship, it is described as<br />  very prominent in ritual. The rishis extol Siva, not only by the <br />  chant<br />  of the three Vedas - the Rig, Yajus and Sama - but also by dance and<br />  music offerings, by the utterance of Pranava, humkara and <br />  prostration:<br />  archanadibhih omkarahumnamaskarair archayanti sadasivam (Vayupurana<br />  54, 6).</p>
<p>  Music and dance (Gandharvaveda), being one of the eighteen vidyas, <br />is<br />  given a high place, and Siva is its greatest exponent. The greatest<br />  masters of dance are, therefore, not only enumerated but described <br />as<br />  always in attendance on the trinity ? Brahma, Vishnu and Siva ? who<br />  are the three great exponents of dance. Naturally, dance is a great<br />  offering for Siva in worship, as he delights in it, and is music and<br />  dance personified. The great exponents are not only Brahma, Vishnu,<br />  and Siva, but also Indra, Adityas, Rudras, Vasus and scores of other<br />  celestials, like Gandharvas, Hamsa, the highest of the Vidyadharas,<br />  Haha, Huhu, Brihaspati, Tumburu, Visvavasu and Apsarases, like <br />  Menaka,<br />  Sahajanya, Parnini, Punjikasthala, Ghritasthala, Ghritachi, <br />Visvachi,<br />  Purvachi, Pramlocha, Anumlochanti, Urvasi (Vayupurana 69, 46-51).</p>
<p>  It is this aptitude for dances that has given the dance aspect of <br />  Siva<br />  prominence in his name Nataraja or Nartesvara. He is known as<br />  Nartesvara in the north, and the term is actually used in the<br />  inscription on the pedestal of one of the most magnificent creations<br />  of the Nataraja image in Pala art, from Bharella, near Dacca. He is<br />  styled, however, Nrittesvara in Isanavarman's Sambor Prei Kuk<br />  inscription from Cambodia. Siva is known as Adavallan in Chola<br />  inscriptions, as he excels in dance, and a whole district is called,<br />  Nityavinoda, the eternal pleasure of dance of Siva. He dances<br />  eternally. That is why he Nityanritya and the embodiment of dance,<br />  which explains the name Nartana. He is the only one who can dance <br />  both<br />  tandava and lasya. Lasya, with the main emphasis on Kaisiki, is best<br />  only in feminine performance, but Siva excels even here. That is why<br />  he is Sarvasadhaka. He can, in his form shows the violent mode of<br />  dance, the other portrays the softer part of it. Siva, however, is<br />  handicapped by the fact that there is nothing in the world beyond <br />  him,<br />  as his immanence precludes his existence beyond it, and dance is a<br />  portrayal of the three worlds. But even in rendering himself, Siva<br />  excels. Siva's dance is only the dance rendering of himself, there<br />  being nothing in the three worlds, apart from him, which would <br />answer<br />  trailokyanukriti. That is why Ratnakara sings the glory of Siva, 'O <br />  my<br />  Lord Sankara, you, who in your immanence, exist by encompassing the<br />  entire universe, mobile and immobile, only rendering yourself as you<br />  dance on all the nights, elaborate the modes of karanas and <br />angaharas<br />  and their usage: karanangaharavidhibhis savistarais sakalasu sankara<br />  nisasu nrityata kriyate tvaya vikritir atmano vibho sacharacharam<br />  jagad avapya tasthushah (Haravijaya 6. 180).</p>
<p>  Siva being hermaphrodite has the unique opportunity to combine rasas<br />  in a special bhavasabalata. He thus obviates the necessity to <br />  restrict<br />  himself to only sringara or raudra. As lasya has sringara as its <br />main<br />  theme, and tandava, raudra, Siva combines both, and illustrates <br />these<br />  two major rasas, a very difficult process indeed, as difficult or<br />  performance as of comprehension by an audience. As Patanjali <br />  tellingly<br />  puts it elsewhere that the pupil was Indra and the teacher <br />  Brihaspati,<br />  Siva himself is here the dancer, and the audience the rest of the<br />  great gods. A beautiful description of Siva's classical beauty as<br />  Ardhanarisvara, is given in the copper-plate of Dharmapala of<br />  Pragjyotisha, where the primal god, the Lord of half a youthful<br />  damsel, poses with ear lobes decorated with a blue lotus in one and<br />  the gems on the serpent hood on the other, and with the torso<br />  symmetrically divided by the high full feminine breast tinged with<br />  fragrant crimson, the masculine half ash-smeared, as if it were the<br />  commingling of the two flavours, sringara and raudra: vande tam<br />  ardhayuvatisvaram adidevam indivaroragaphanamanikarnapuram<br />  uttungapinakuchakunkumabhasmabhinnam srihagararaudrarasayor iva <br />  sargam<br />  ekam (Epigraph. Ind. 30, p. 205).</p>
<p>  Siva is not only the Lord of tandava and lasya in both varieties of<br />  nritta and nritya, but he is also the Lord of natya. He is the actor<br />  on the world stage, the Mahasailusha, as he is known and called<br />  sometimes. He is styled Natakesvara in the Prasat Ta Keo inscription<br />  of Suryavarman from Cambodia. Even here one the stage, in following<br />  the dialogue and theme of a nataka, the actor has to follow the<br />  principles of nritya, and by the language of gesture convey the <br />sense<br />  of the text of the drama as the actor. There are elaborate <br />  injunctions<br />  as to how a drisya kavya, like the nataka, has to be indicated by<br />  dance or nritya and abhinaya. The stage directions in <br />Raghavabhatta's<br />  commentary, Arthadyotanika on Abhijnanasakuntalam, would make this<br />  very clear. Coomaraswamy has illustrated a few points in his<br />  introduction to the Mirror of Gesture, the nalina-padmakosa hands,<br />  palms downwards, for watering of a tree, moving the head quickly to<br />  and fro, vidhuta, lips quivering, hands in pataka unsteadily against<br />  the face to show fear of a bee, and so for the (Mirror of Gesture, <br />  pp.<br />  4-5). It is this mystery of Siva's dance and association of Siva as<br />  tutelary deity of Natya that accounts for the mention of several<br />  presentations of innumerable danseuses to Siva temples in India and <br />  in<br />  other parts of South East Asia. The classical instance is the gift <br />of<br />  four hundred dancing girls to the temple of the Lord of dance,<br />  Adavallan, in the shrine of Rajarajesvara at Tanjavur, with recorded<br />  elaborate provision for their maintenance provided by the emperor<br />  Rajaraja. The Badaun inscription of Lakhanapala mentions how, dance<br />  forming a vital and vivid part of temple worship ritual, the ascetic<br />  rajaguru Isanasiva caused adequate provision to be made for this<br />  perpetual daily worship. The world would be wonderstruck at the<br />  elaborate details of the great worship, causing almost a holy<br />  giddiness, with the utmost praise propitiating the Beloved of the<br />  Mountain-princes in daily ritual, the danseuses dancing, scattering<br />  flowers to the sound of music of the orchestra, heightened by the<br />  sweet sound of the lute, like the hum of the bees, drowned by the<br />  clang of the temple bells in action: turyanam sanninadair<br />  madhukaramadhurair vallakisphitagitair ghantasamghattaghoshaih<br />  kusumaparimalair nartanair nartakinam yasminnatyantabhaktya mahati<br />  girisutavallabham nityaritya bhrantih pavitriki syad<br />  atibahalamahapujaya vismitanam (Epigraph. Ind. 1, p. 66).</p>
<p>  In a copper plate of Prabhutavarsha, the temple ritual, including<br />  elaborate offering of dance by danseuses, is mentioned. The poet of<br />  the inscription shows how the audience in the temple was so<br />  appreciative that it was captivated by the excellence of the<br />  performance. The temple of Kannesvara, where the young women of the<br />  city were enthralled by the dances of moon-faced girls, skilled in<br />  gestures, indicated by their sprout-like hands, conveying their<br />  sentiments and their emotions at the time of the dhupa, is a passage<br />  of importance, showing how in medieval India, the Lord of dance was<br />  propitiated by appropriate provision of danseuses in temples:<br />  dhumavelalilagatavilasinijananam<br />  karatalakisalayarasabhava-<br />  sadbhavaprakatanakusalasasivadananganarnartanahrita-<br />  paurayuvatijanachittantaram<br />  (Epigraph, Ind. 1, p. 305).</p>
<p>  An early Eastern Ganga inscription of Aniyanka Bhima, from<br />  Bhubanesvar, incised in the Svapnesvara temple, gives a sparkling<br />  vision painted in words of the danseuses, presented to Tripurahara<br />  Siva Svapnesvara, whose moving side-long glances are spells to<br />  captivate the universe, whose footsteps in dance still the motion of<br />  all the denizens of the three worlds, whose germ-set bracelets shoot<br />  froth the illumination of a thousand lamps without effort, at the<br />  commencement of their dance: yasminnetranchalataralima<br />  visvavasyaikamantrah padanyasas tribhubanagatistambhanam samvidhatte<br />  nrityarambhe valayamanibhir nirmitaratnadipas tasmai dattas<br />  tripurajayine tena tasta mrigakshyah (Epigraph. Ind. 6, p. 202).</p>
<p>  Siva being the main source of dance, interpretation of karanas and<br />  angaharas, created by Vishnu by his movements as he engaged Madhu <br />and<br />  Kaitabha in battle, have been the main source of inspiration for the<br />  entire text on the dance forms by Bharata and others. The <br />Natyasastra<br />  clearly says that Bharata prepared the text, based mainly on what he<br />  saw as the interpretation of rechakas, karanas and angaharas, as <br />Siva<br />  danced and, by word of mouth, explained their nuances: rechakair<br />  angaharais cha nrityantam vikshya sankaram ityapi bruvata spashtam <br />  tad<br />  eva munina kritam (Natyasastra 4.257).</p>
<p>  The dance of Siva, both as a sight for the eyes to experience and <br />for<br />  the ears to hear, in regard to the rhythmic tap of the feet, in<br />  consonance with the orchestral sound, are picturesquely presented as<br />  it were, one by Dhanapala and the other by Trivikrama. Dhanapala<br />  imagines a battle array, with thousands of flags fluttering, swayed <br />  by<br />  blasts of wild wind, appearing like the tandava dance of Siva:<br />  sakhandaparasutandava iva prachandaniladhutadhvajasahasraih<br />  (Tilakamanjari 2, p. 203). Dhanapala is very fond of Kanchi and the<br />  south. He is surely recalling the innumerable flames, like flags on<br />  the mandala around Nataraja, a peculiar feature in the south in the<br />  representation of the dancing Siva. In the line previous to this, he<br />  refers to flame weapons exactly like these, like the flash of <br />  lighting<br />  fast approaching sakti weapons, all a flame. This effect of<br />  innumerable flames, as in a battlefield, suggests not only a normal<br />  pleasureable dance but something more, the dance of victory on the<br />  battlefield, where the greatest opponents, like the Tripuras, are<br />  overcome by the dark flames as weapons. The play of flames in<br />  Tripurasamhara is itself very picturesquely painted in a famous <br />verse<br />  where bhayanaka, raudra and sringara are commingled. May the flames<br />  from the darts of Siva destroy all evil, flames, that like a <br />  faithless<br />  lover caught erring, are discarded by the youthful tear-stained<br />  lotus-eyed damsels from the seraglio of the Tripuras, thrown aside,<br />  caught on their hand, violently shaken as they pulled at the hem of<br />  the garments, flung aside as they caught their dresses, not even<br />  observed in their embarrassment, even when fallen at their feet,<br />  shaken off as they tried to embrace and envelop them: kshipto<br />  hastavalagnah prasabham abhihato pyadadanomsukantam grihnan<br />  keseshvapastas charananipatito nekshitas sambhramena alingan<br />  yovadhutas tripurayuvatibhis sasrunetrotpalabhih kamivardraparadhas <br />  sa<br />  dhaatu duritam sambhavo vas saragnih (Amar-ukam 2).</p>
<p>  Even the arrow of Siva is described as dancing, particularly that of<br />  Tripurantaka. It is very appropriate because the arrow of Siva is <br />  made<br />  up of both Agni and Vishnu. The flame of fire is a great dancer,<br />  indeed, and Vishnu created the lovely vrittis which constitute the<br />  element of charm in dance. Like Brahma and Siva, Vishnu is also a<br />  great acharya or preceptor of dance. The verse of Vaidya Gadadhara <br />is<br />  a picturesque description of Tripurantaka's arrow as a dancer. The<br />  flame of arrow performs the tandava dance, removing the enveloping<br />  curtain of smoke for entering the stage, scatters a handful of <br />  flowers<br />  in the guise of sparks of fire all over, and lightly stepping on the<br />  wide expanse of the mansions of the three cities, created by Maya,<br />  completely envelopes the aspect of the emotion of terror, <br />multiplying<br />  in all directions: vishvag vyadhuya dhumaprachayayavanikam<br />  sphayamanasphulingavyajad akirya pushpanjalim upari padam nyasyato<br />  mandiranam svachchandabhogasima mahati mayapure<br />  dattaraudrangaragavyaptaseshasya visvesvarasarasikhinas tandavam nah<br />  punatu (Saduktikarnamritam, p. 23, 78).</p>
<p>  The sound of Siva's dance steps also again recalling the rhythm in<br />  martial music is conceived in equality picturesque fashion, where<br />  Trivikrama compares the tap sound of Siva's dance steps to that of <br />  the<br />  hoofs of the horse on the move, appearing to exercise themselves in<br />  the technique of Siva's dance steps themselves:<br />  chatulakhuracharipracharenadambaritatandavasya khandaparasoh <br />  padalilam<br />  iva' bhyasyata?.jatyataraturagasainyena parivritah (Nalachampu 6. <br />pp.<br />  373-74).</p>
<p>  A Kakatiya inscription gives exactly the same simulation of Siva's<br />  dance steps to similar tap of the hoofs of the equestrian regiment<br />  marching forth to battle.</p>
<p>  In early Tamil literature, there is elaborate description of Siva's<br />  martial dance. Siva as Dakshinamurti, Gangadhara, Kalikatandava,<br />  Vinadhara, Tripurantaka, Gajantaka, Brahmasiraschhetta, is fused in<br />  the concept of the dancing Siva in the company of Devi, the witness <br />o<br />  his dance, who keeps time and applauds, in the invocation to the <br />  early<br />  Tamil poem kalittokai. Here Siva, who taught the Vedas and Vedangas <br />  to<br />  the seers, scattered fire on the Tripuras, contested in dance with<br />  Kali, created music from his drum, is described as dancing, in his <br />  joy<br />  of victory, the Kotti, Pandaranga and Kapala dances, eight-armed,<br />  wearing the tiger skin and with the skull of Brahma in his hand, as<br />  Devi of lovely form, with attenuated waist, drooping shoulders and<br />  perfumed locks, attracting bees, watches the time beat: aru ari<br />  antanarkku aru marai pala pakarntu teru nir chataik karantu <br />tirupuram<br />  timatuttu karamal kurittatan mel chellum katun kuli marap por mani<br />  mitarru en kaiyay kel in patuparai pala iyampa pal uruvam peyarttu <br />ni<br />  kotikotti atunkai kotu uyar akal alkul koti purai nuchuppinai konta<br />  chir taruvalo mantu amar pala katantu matukaiyal niru anintu<br />  pantarankarm atumkai panai elil anai men tol vantu ararrum kuntalai<br />  valar tukkut taruvalo kolai uluvait tol achaii konraittar chuvar<br />  purala talai ankai kontu ni kapalam atumkal mulai aninta muruvalal<br />  munpanitaruvalo paniyum tukkum chirun enru ivai man ilai arival <br />kappa<br />  anam il poru! emakku amarntanai ati (History of Tamil Literature p.<br />  154).</p>
<p>  In fact, Siva's dance in several instances is the dance of victory.<br />  There is a very early yupa inscription from Nandsa, near Udaipur,<br />  mentioning the dance of victory. The word used is Jayanartana. This<br />  auspicious name of king, very appropriately chosen, assures prowess <br />  to<br />  a prince as soon as he is born. Jayanartana can be the name of no<br />  other than Siva himself, who danced the Tripurasamhara and <br />  Gajasamhara<br />  dance: jayanartanaprabhavardhanapautrasya jayasomaputrasya sominetus<br />  srisomasya (Epigraph. Ind. 27, p. 263).</p>
<p>  Jaya in describing dance closely correlates it with warfare and <br />  points<br />  out how mandalas, angaharas and music are essentials in both. A wise<br />  one should utilise in warfare, as well as in regular dance, the<br />  different mandalas in their varieties, as well as pleasing angaharas<br />  that captivate the mind, to the accompaniment of music: etani<br />  khandasahitanyapi mandalani lilangayashtimadhurani manoharani<br />  vadyanugani vivadhani budho niyuddhe yuddhetha naratanavidhau <br />  vidhivad<br />  vidadhyat (Nrittaratnavali 3. 197).</p>
<p>  Jaya, the Commander of the armed forces of the Kakatiyas, who was<br />  himself an adept in fine arts, particularly, music and dance, <br />besides<br />  being a poet, fancies Siva the Lord of dance, as they very <br />embodiment<br />  of nritya. He, therefore, by a play on words, brings together the<br />  names of all the karanas, at the same time describing a situation of<br />  Siva in dance, with his foot resounding with the anklet slipped on <br />it<br />  by Parvati, bending forward to embrace him, with his hand holding <br />the<br />  leaping deer, entwined by the quivering snake, joyously raising his<br />  knee in sport, to gently move aside the Nandi bull, come very close <br />  to<br />  him. Siva, the lord of the daughter of the mountain, looks the very<br />  embodiment of dance karanas, like valitoru, vartita, akshipta, <br />  nupura,<br />  kranta, harinapluta, bhujanganchita, parsvakranta, apaviddha,<br />  vrishabhakrida, urdhvajanu and the rest:<br />  aslishyadvalitoruvarttitasivak-shiptasphurannupurakrantamghrim<br />  harinaplutasrayakaram chanchadbhujanganchitam<br />  parsvakrantapadapaviddhavrishabhakridordhvajanutsukamvyachashte<br />  karanaugham adritanayakantopamam jayanah (Nrittaratnavali 4.1).</p>
<p>  In describing a situation like the dire need of the Devas to master <br />a<br />  precious text of dancing by a specialist like Nandikesvara in order <br />  to<br />  overcome a great dancer representing the Daityas, the appellation<br />  given even to him is Natasekhara. Indra request Nandikesvara to<br />  acquaint him with Bharatarnava so that he could triumph over<br />  Natasekhara. Natasekhara means 'the crest jewel among dancers'. It <br />is<br />  not very different from the appellation Nataraja. In the Sivapurana,<br />  Bana, the great devotes of Siva, is described as dancing his best to<br />  please Siva who is never so overjoyed as when he listens to Sama <br />  music<br />  and witnesses the best of dance. The story of Ravana, chanting the<br />  Sama hymns in musical notes to please Siva and get released from <br />  under<br />  the Kailasa mountain where he got trapped by his own overweaning<br />  pride, when he tried to shake the mighty mountain, is only too well<br />  known.</p>
<p>  Music and dance can never be separated. In fact, sangita includes<br />  music, both vocal and instrumental, and dance. There is very early<br />  mention of all these as silpa (Kausitaki Brahmana 29.5). That is why<br />  Siva is sometimes represented as the Lord of music with the lute and<br />  sometimes as a dancer carrying the lute. He also occasionally plays<br />  the drum independently, as the musical Dakshinamurti, or sounds the<br />  drum dancing as Nataraja. When Kalidasa says sangitaya <br />  prahatamurajah-<br />  sangita means not only instrumental and vocal music, atodya and <br />gita,<br />  but also nritya or dance. By dance has to be understood not only <br />pure<br />  nritta, composed of tala and laya, but also nritya which expounds <br />the<br />  text of the song through abhinaya. This brings into the scene<br />  literature. The sculpturesque position in dance and the beautiful<br />  situations in the stances of angaharas and karanas, where the body<br />  beautiful looks much more so by the flexions, completely draws in <br />the<br />  art of chitra, sculpture and painting, which give a permanent vision<br />  of fleeting, charming situations in dance. That is why Siva, as<br />  Vinadhara Dakshinamurti and as Nataraja, along with Vyakhyana<br />  Dakshinamurti, go together. Even in dance, it is not any theme that <br />  is<br />  favoured so much as a worthy theme, like the Tripurasamhara, which <br />is<br />  the greatest heroic episode appealing at once to literature, art,<br />  music and dance: tripuravijayo giyate kinnaribhih (Meghaduta 1.58).<br />  Tradition also has it that the first performance to popularise natya<br />  among the gods was Tripuravijaya, witnessed and appreciated by Siva<br />  himself. A very important early terracotta of the Sunga period,<br />  representing Siva as Vina Dakshinamurti, emphasises the sangita <br />  aspect<br />  of Siva and in mute eloquence describes him as the teacher of music,<br />  vocal and instrumental, and dance. Centuries later, was created the<br />  more developed, charming, rate iconographic figure of Siva, as<br />  Saptasvaramaya. Siva from Parel is a form multiplied into seven to<br />  represent the personified musical notes, nishada, rishabha, <br />gandhara,<br />  shadja, madhyama and dhaivata. The Ganas themselves are shown at the<br />  feet, on either side, playing the four varieties of musical<br />  instruments that compose the atodya, the stringed, tata, including <br />  the<br />  harp, lute and other vina-like instruments, the anaddha like <br />  mridanga,<br />  muraja, pushkara and other varieties of drum, belonging to the<br />  percussion class, the sushira variety of wind instruments, like the<br />  flute and others, and the ghana, or clanging metallic cymbals and<br />  others of that type, both large and small. There can be no mistaking<br />  the intent of the Vakataka sculptor who has portrayed the musical <br />  Siva<br />  at Parel. It is one of the gems of Vakataka art. The theme of<br />  Bhutaganas playing musical instruments as orchestral accompaniment <br />to<br />  Siva's dance is a great favourite in literature as in art and in the<br />  Tevaram hymns of the early Tamil saints there are pictures conjured<br />  up, as by Tirujnanasambanda, who has Siva or Alankador, with the<br />  crescent moon, the mighty stream of Ganga in his locks, dancing, as<br />  many Vedic chants are accompanied by the play of drum, flute and <br />harp<br />  by the Bhutaganas: paraiyunchirukkulalum yalumputam payirrave <br />  maraiyum<br />  palapati mayanattiraiya maintanar piraiyumperumpunalcher <br />  chataiyinarum<br />  (Tevarattirupatikam 45.6).</p>
<p>  As the drum precedes the other musical instruments, both for music <br />  and<br />  for dance, the sounding of it by Nandi at the commencement of Siva's<br />  dance becomes a favourite theme in literary descriptions. Mayura has<br />  an interesting allusion to it. He compares it to the pranava or <br />  omkara<br />  at the commencement of Vedic chant. The sound of the Nandi drum by<br />  Nandi at the start of the evening dance of the foe of Madana (Siva),<br />  is like the first blast of winds in the season of laden clouds, like<br />  smoke before fire, like the first created (water) in the universe,<br />  like the sacred Om for the mass of Vedic literature, the son of<br />  Vinata, i.e. Aruna at the front of the vehicle of Surya: paurastyas<br />  toyadartoh Pavana iva pavan pavakasyeva dhumo visvasyevadisargo<br />  pranava ive param pavano vedaraseh sandhyanrityotsavechchhor iva<br />  madanaripor nandinandininadas saurasyagre sukham vo vitaratu<br />  vinatanandanas syandanasya (Mayurasataka, 55).</p>
<p>  Siva being the most auspicious, the orchestra itself, composed of<br />  vina, venu and mridanga, in turn serve the purpose of the great <br />dance<br />  master, and are thus auspicious. Ratnakara records the ancient <br />belief<br />  that the musical orchestra is a remover of visha or poison. Siva as<br />  the greatest of physicians, bhishaktama among the bhishajas, the<br />  greatest among the physicians, as the Veda would have it, is the <br />  great<br />  God who swallowed the deadliest poison, kalakuta. Naturally, Siva's<br />  orchestra of vina, venu and mridanga, can be held to be consecrated <br />  by<br />  mantra and remove all visha or poison. The general belief that<br />  consecrated musical instruments remove poison is thus voiced by<br />  Ratnakara: prastauti mantrakritasamskritirupavenuvinaravopi <br />  vishamasya<br />  vishasya nasam (Haravijaya 16, 9). The learned commentator gives the<br />  authority for this belief: mantrena kritasamskaram rupam yasya <br />  vinades<br />  tadiyo ravo visham nasayati; yad<br />  uktam-'vinavenumridangadarpanataleshvaropitah kichako dashtanam<br />  vishapankalepam achirad dhyatas samutpumsayer' iti.</p>
<p>  Kalidasa conceives of a magnificent natural orchestra for Siva, with<br />  nor artificial instrument, but natural elements themselves combining<br />  to produce the effect of the four instruments composing atodya. <br />  Filled<br />  with wind, the bamboos sound sweet with the effect of venu (flute),<br />  the resounding thunder of the cloud gives the effect of the noble <br />  note<br />  of the muraja drum, as vocal music is supplied by the sweet-throated<br />  Kinnaris, singing in passionate earnestness the great theme of <br />Siva's<br />  triumph over the Tripuras. Kalidasa feels that this would complete <br />  the<br />  musical background for Pasupati's dance: sabdayante madhuram anilaih<br />  kichakash puryamanas samraktabhis tripuravijayo giyate kinnaribhih<br />  nirhradas te muraja iva chet kandareshu dhvanis syat sangitartho <br />nanu<br />  pasupates tatra bhavi samagrah (Meghaduta 1.56).</p>
<p>  So stupendous is the concept of the Lord of dance, Nataraja, so<br />  completely enveloping the universe, in which and as which he dances,<br />  an impossible situation indeed, where he is both the container and <br />  the<br />  contained, that his adoration through dance and music, which is <br />  itself<br />  part of temple ritual, is likened to lighting up the sun with a <br />  flame.<br />  Sudraka laughs at this idea of adoring Siva, the Lord of dance, by<br />  dance and music, as this is not different from the worship of the <br />sun<br />  by waving the lamp before him, or the ocean by offering a handful of<br />  water, or Vasanta, the god of spring, by a scatter of blooming<br />  flowers, which is all the same as the adoration of the Lord of <br />  letters<br />  by utterances: suryam yajanti dipais samudram adbhir vasantam api<br />  pushpaih archamo bhagavantam vayam api vagisvaram vagbhih<br />  (Padmaprabhritaka 11).</p>
<p>  What is meant here is music, and sangita necessarily brings in dance<br />  also, which is an offering to Siva Dakshinamurti, who is also a <br />  dancer<br />  carrying the vina, symbolising music and dance. This idea closely<br />  follows the hymn from the Upanishad, na tatra suryo bhati na<br />  chandratarakam nema vidyuto bhanti kutoyam agnih tam eva bhantam<br />  anubhati sarvam tasya bhasa sarvam idam vibhati. The ideas of Siva<br />  about dance are manifest or unmanifest as there is no knowledge of<br />  dance or music or any other art of science apart from him. That is<br />  why, while appreciating the performance of Samudramathana and<br />  Tripuradaha by the celestials, Siva tells Bharata that he had also<br />  been often contemplating as he danced in the evenings, on the beauty<br />  of natya as he now witnessed it. He himself however had preference <br />  for<br />  nritta in the charming Kaisiki mode. With an admixture of the<br />  perfection of nritta with its angaharas and karanas, as taught to <br />him<br />  by Tandu at the instance of Siva, Bharata improved his natya.</p>
<p>  The<br />  ancients visualised Nataraja as a manifestation of the cosmic energy<br />  symbolising the three aspects of creation, preservation and<br />  destruction. The dance of Nataraja has always been synonymously <br />  viewed<br />  with truth and beauty, force and rhythm, movement and change,<br />  realisation and dissolution. Nataraja has been visualised in variety<br />  of forms by seers, poets and artists- chiselled, painted, described<br />  and sung about in many parts of India and countries in the<br />  neighbourhood since long. This itself is a testimony to the twin<br />  aspects of time and timelessness of Nataraja,both as a personality <br />  and<br />  as a theme. This book highlights Nataraja as the presiding deity of<br />  fine arts whether it be music, dance, painting, sculpture or<br />  epigraphy. The Vedic roots of the cosmic dancer and the blend of<br />  tradition and modernity is woven as a thread throughout the book<br />  describing vividly the exploits of the great dancer on world stage. <br />  It<br />  also contains interesting information on famous spots of the <br />Nataraja<br />  theme and the concept of Nataraja beyond Indian frontiers.</p>
<p>  About the Author:</p>
<p>  Dr. Sivaramamurti has been one of the most acclaimed art historians <br />  of<br />  this country. He had devoted an entire life time to iconography,<br />  especially to the Nataraja theme. This book is an outcome of his<br />  research as part of the Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship awarded to him<br />  1968. Some of the other books of the author include South Indian<br />  Paintings, Some Aspects of Indian Culture, Indian Sculpture and<br />  Sanskrit Literature and Art.</p>
