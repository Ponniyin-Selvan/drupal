<p>Subramania Bharati was born on 11 December 1882 at Ettayapuram in the<br />Tirunelveli District. His father Chinnaswamy Iyer was a learned Brahmin<br />attached to the Ettayapuram Zamin. He was also interested in Western<br />technology and managed to install the first textile mill at Ettayapuram in<br />1880. Bharati lost his mother when he was hardly five but found in his<br />stepmother affection and love. He was a precocious child and became a Tamil<br />scholar at a very early age. He was awarded the title of 'Bharati' for<br />successfully taking part in literary contest sponsored by the Raja of<br />Ettayapuram.</p>
<p>After a few years of reluctant schooling in Tirunelveli, he joined the Zamin<br />service in 1897.The same year he was married to Chellammal. The sudden death<br />of Iyer in 1898 left him rudderless; he went to Banaras where his aunt<br />Kuppammal gave him shelter. He passed the Entrance examination of the<br />Allahabad University. Though he returned to Ettayapuram, Bharati was not<br />happy in the decadent, strife-ridden society of the Raja's palace. He took<br />up a temporary teaching post in Tamil at Madurai Setupati High School and<br />later joined theTamil daily Swadesa Mithran.</p>
<p>The new job took him to Madras. His major work in the office was to<br />translate into Tamil news appearing in English dailies. This job gave him a<br />taste for politics and social reform. His passion-swathed patriotic poems<br />thrilled the entire Tamil Nadu and enthused the people to take part in<br />direct action. During these days,he met Sister Nivedita who blessed his<br />political involvement and zeal for the emancipation of women.</p>
<p>Bharati was closely associated with the Extremist movement in the<br />Congress.To escape police persecution he retired to Pondicherry in1908. Here<br />he spent ten years writing brilliant poetry and prose. Tired with an exile's<br />life, he returned to British India. He was promptly arrested but released at<br />the instant of his well wishers. He rejoined his desk at the Swadesa Mithran<br />office but died in 1921 after being hit by the temple elephant at<br />Triplicane.</p>
<p>Though Bharati was involved in active policies throughout his life and spent<br />his time in spirit-consuming journalism, he has left behind considerable<br />body of brilliant poetry. His poems can be divided into four categories:<br />Patriotic Poems, Devotional Songs ; Miscellaneous Poems ; Three Great Poems.</p>
<p>*Patriotic Poems :* Bharati who loved Shelley's tireless search for<br />individual liberty was influenced by him while writing patriotic poetry. He<br />caught the breathless attention of the Tamil people with his powerful lyric,<br />the bulk of which are to be found in ' Swadesa Gitangal ' (1908) and ' Janma<br />Bhumi ' (1909). Significantly he dedicated both the books to Sisters<br />Nivedita.</p>
<p>Abjuring mere political propaganda he gave a spiritual dimension to the<br />Indian thirst for freedom. He approached his task from three directions ; an<br />incantatory review of India, detailing its physical and spiritual rareness ; an injection of the ideal of ' freedom ' into every person so as to banish<br />fear ; an evocation of the lives of the great men of India as living<br />examples for emulation.</p>
<p>*Devotional Songs:* Bharati was a deeply religious man but had no patience<br />with obscurantism. The prayer songs dedicated to the embodied manifestations<br />of the University Deity are very popular today. His knowledge hymns repeat<br />the Vedantic search for universality. His autobiographical fragments too<br />come under this category. They are ' A Dream ' and ' Bharati : Sixty-Six '.<br />The most significant group is formed by his poems on Shakti. Bharti's ishta<br />devta was Shakti, the primordial power that makes and unmakes the whole<br />universe</p>
<p>The Kali worship he witnessed at Banaras his meeting with Sister Nivedita,<br />the powerful poem ' Vande Mataram ' indicated by Bankim -all influence his<br />Shakti songs. His approach is personal and approximates to the Mother -Child<br />relationship. Her many aspects are caught within the area of his poetic<br />creation. ' Oozhi-k-koothu 'is the most audaciously frenzied and most<br />poetically articulate piece in the Bharati canon .It is a description of the<br />Mother's terrible dance of destruction which is at last arresed by the<br />advent of Shiva in his auspicious form, and they unite to recreate the<br />worlds once again.</p>
<p>*Miscellaneous Poems:* The subject matter of these lyrics is social reform.<br />Even " Puthia Athisoodi " which is apparently meant for children has<br />commitments such as ' Curse Astrology', 'Learn Astronomy' and ' Modernise<br />ancient scriptures '. Many of the poems deal with nature, education and the<br />dignity of labour. Much of his nature poetry is contain in 'Vachana Kavithai<br />'. The emancipation of women excercised Bharati's mind greatly. He<br />visualised The ' New Woman ' as an emanation of Shakti. A willing helpmate<br />of man to build a new earth through co-operative endeavour.</p>
<p>*Three Great Poems :* ( 1 ) ' Kannan Pattu ' Consists of twenty-three lyrics<br />published in 1917.Bharati ecstatically sang of Krishna as a friend , mother<br />, servant , teacher , student ,king ,child, prankish boy ,lover ,lady-love<br />and deity. The nayaka-nayaki bhava of Indian ecstatics is given a novel<br />twist by Bharati whose intense absorption in Krishna gives this superb<br />collection a unique place in Tamil literature.</p>
<p>(2) The first part of 'Panchali Sapatham 'appeared in 1912 and the second<br />part twelve years later. Bharati's epic concentrates on the critical<br />movement when Duhshasana rises to disorobe Draupadi. By choosing this moment<br />and linking it to the earlier motivation of Duryodhana and the later series<br />of 'vows' by the Pandavas that seal his fate, Bharati created an<br />architecturally perfect poem that has both the epic sweep and the intensity<br />of tragic drama. The epic consists of five cantos. For the first time a long<br />Tamil poem was written with "simple phrases, simple style, easily understood<br />prosody, rhythms liked by the common man".</p>
<p>Bharati's ideas on social reform, anxiety to rid India of its foreign rulers<br />and devotion to Mahashakti also find a place in the movement of the epic.<br />The insulted and injured Queen, womanhood fighting for her due place in the<br />world of men, Mother India struggling to be free, and Mahashakti in the<br />plenitude of her splendour: these four attributes merge in that immortal<br />character turning from men to God at the centre of the Kuru court.</p>
<p>(3) "Kuyil Pattu' is a narrative poem and tells a fable about an Indian<br />nightingale, a bull and a monkey. The human characters are a prince and a<br />poet. The story came to the poet in a dream, a kind of vision of Beauty and<br />love. The fable could be interpreted in many ways. Chiefly, the poem seems<br />to point out the impossibility of a divine love on earth. Inevitably the<br />mundane earth tarnishes and kills such true love. The poem initiated a new<br />trend in Tamil poetry.</p>
<p>Bharati wrote short stories and an unfinished novel, 'Chandrikayin Kathai'.<br />His 'wisdom tales', in imitation of 'Panchatantra' and 'Hitopadesa' stories,<br />are still popular in Tamil Nadu. Bharati also wrote in English and these<br />writings have been collected in 'Agni and Other Poems and Translations'<br />(1937) and 'Essays and other Prose Fragments' (1937).</p>
<p>Subramania Bharati is now fully acknowledged as the father of modern Tamil<br />style. He showed the Tamilians that that the spoken rhythms of the language<br />can be easily transferred to the written page. It would be no exaggeration<br />to say that creative writing in Tamil during the last five decades owes its<br />existence to Bharati. Above everything else, he was one of the earliest to<br />speak of India as an entity. In his poems and prose writing he stressed the<br />need for an integrated India as an entity. In his poems and prose writings<br />he stressed the need for an integrated India and exhorted the Indians to<br />eschew regional rivalries and think in terms of an 'Indian'.</p>
<p>Poem after poem describes the best in each region and how these should be<br />brought together to build a glorious future for India. He was sure that when<br />the call came, India's millions would answer with one voice. So he sang of<br />Mother Bharat at the dawn of our Independence Movement:<br />"She has thirty crores of faces,<br />But her heart is one; She speaks eighteen languages,<br />Yet her mind is one".</p>
<p>His message for national unity is still relevant for our life times.</p>
<p>Author : Prema Nandakumar</p>
<p>Sardar A.Vedaratnam Pillai of Vedaraniam</p>
<p>Vedaratnam Pillai was born on 25th February 1897 in Vedaraniam to salt<br />merchants Appakutty Pillai and Thangam Aachi. He was younger of the two<br />children for his parents. He belonged to the *Saiva* (vegetarian) Pillai<br />community that had a long tradition both of composing Tamil poetry about<br />Lord Shiva and serving and managing Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>As a young man growing up in a pious and a patriotic family, Vedaratnam<br />Pillai was deeply influenced by Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, and Rajaji.<br />He liked their ideas and joined India's Freedom Struggle as a teenager. He<br />followed the teachings of Gandhiji and made cotton clothes for himself and<br />requested that everyone in his family wear only *Khadi* (pure cotton). He<br />eagerly participated in the boycott of foreign cloth, called<br />*Swadehsi*(from ones own nation) movement<br />* *(supporting materials made locally as opposed to made abroad). With the<br />blessings and help from his older brother, young Vedaratnam devoted a lot of<br />time in the Freedom Struggle, was arrested several times and spent several<br />months in prison. In 1930 when Gandhiji started his now famous salt<br />*Satyagraha<br />*(non-violent; strong belief in truth) March to Dandi in Gujarat, Vedaratnam<br />Pillai and Rajaji carried out the march in Vedaraniam, first of its kind in<br />South India putting himself and his family at risk. Because of this<br />Vedaratnam Pillai had to face the anger of the British Government which made<br />him pay triple the damages: a fine, time in jail, and confiscated his land<br />and property.</p>
<p>In 1931, he attended the meeting of the agriculturists in Tamil Nadu where<br />he was given the title of *Sardar* (a commander) in recognition of his<br />participation in the freedom struggle, particularly the Salt* Satyagraha*.<br />In 1942, when Rajaji and other freedom fighters were arrested by the<br />British, Mr. Vedaratnam Pillai made sure Gandiji's teachings and programs<br />were kept alive and well. Following the death of Kasthurba Gandhi (wife of<br />Mahatma Gandhi) in 1944, he went around and requested funds for several<br />Women's and Children's Welfare Centers. In 1946, he founded the Kasthurba<br />Gandhi Kanya Gurukulam in Vedaraniam, a residential school with free<br />boarding and lodging for poor girls. For his service in the field of<br />untouchable's (*Harijhan*) welfare, he was awarded a gold medal by the<br />Madras (now Tamil Nadu) Government. He was elected three times as a Member<br />of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of Madras State (now Tamil Nadu). He<br />donated all his MLA salary to Shri Ramakrishna Mission. He passed away on<br />August 24, 1961 due to an heart ailment while still attending the Madras<br />Assembly. The Gurukulam which he founded for the purpose of women's<br />betterment carries on its mission of educating young and unprivileged girls<br />even today. He was a nationalist and was opposed regionalism, and advocated<br />the study of Hindi as the unifying language, despite the fact that he was<br />fond of Tamil. The Indian Department of Posts issued a special<br />commemorative postage stamp, which you can see here, in the memory of him to<br />mark his 101st birth day.</p>
<p>*ROLE OF TAMILNADU IN THE FREEDOM STRUGGLE*</p>
<p>* *</p>
<p>*MODERATES, EXTREMISTS AND GANDHIAN PERIOD*</p>
<p>Tamilnadu played a vital role in the Indian freedom movement. Many leaders<br />have shed their life for the cause of our freedom. Because of their<br />sacrifice we got liberation and freedom from the British rule.</p>
<p>*Rise of Nationalism: *The nineteenth century witnessed the socioreligious<br />reform movements. The rise of nationalism took its deep root in Tamilnadu.<br />During that period, Swami Vivekananda stayed at Chennai and delivered his<br />patriotic speeches. It kindled the spirit of the people to a greater extent.<br />Raja of Ramnad helped Swami Vivekananda for his voyage to Chicago. His<br />speech at Chicago was very famous. He loved and encouraged the youth of<br />Tamilnadu. The press, particularly The Hindu, Swadesamitran and Desabakthan<br />played a significant role in awakening the people. Means of transport like<br />railways helped the Nationalists to carry their ideas even to the remote<br />places of Tamilnadu.</p>
<p>In order to rise the prestige of Tamil people the Madras Native Association<br />was founded in 1852. The grievances of the people were submitted to the<br />British Government. Madras Mahajana Sabha was established in 1884.<br />G.Subramaniya Iyer, P.Anandacharlu, Rangaiya Naidu played a significant part<br />in the association to redress the miseries of the people.</p>
<p>*Rise of Indian National Congress*: The Indian National Congress was founded<br />by A.O.Hume in 1885. With the formation of Indian National Congress in 1885,<br />the freedom movement gained momentum in Tamilnadu. The first conference of<br />the congress was held at Bombay under the presidentship of W.C.Banerji.<br />C.Vijayaraghavachariyar of Salem, a close associate of A.O. Hume, was one of<br />the members of the committee which drafted the constitution of Indian<br />National</p>
<p>Congress. G.Subramaniya Iyer of Chennai participated and moved a resolution<br />in the congress. In the beginning, the role of the Indian National Congress<br />was not to oppose the British government, but to submit their grievances in<br />a peaceful way. The sessions of Indian National Congress were convened at<br />Madras in 1887, 1895 and 1898. C.Vijayaraghavachariyar took a prominent role<br />in framing the rules of the congress during these years. During the early<br />phase of the congress,</p>
<p>V.O.Chidambaram Pillai led the people of Tamilnadu in the Independent<br />struggle. He started the Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company at Tuticorin. He</p>
<p>vehemently opposed the British imperialism To honour his service and<br />sacrifice he was given the title Kappalottiya Tamizhan</p>
<p>*Surat** Congress: *The Indian National Congress was held at Surat in the<br />year 1907. In this session ,Congress got split into extremists and<br />moderates. The extremists were led by Balagangadhar Tilak. *Swaraj is my<br />birth right' is the famous slogan of Balagangadhar Tilak.*</p>
<p>* *</p>
<p>*Rise of Extremism: *Balagangadhar Tilak was supported by V.O.Chidambaram<br />Pillai and Subramaniya Siva. They were called the Lieutenant's of Tilak and<br />they chanted the Mantra *'Vande Mataram'. *In Tuticorin, V.O.Chidambaram<br />Pillai and Subramaniya Siva protested against the British administration. In<br />1908 the mill workers of Tirunelveli and Tuticorin struck work, Ashe the Sub<br />Collector of Tirunelveli, fired into the crowd. The leaders who supported<br />the workers were arrested and imprisoned at Coimbatore and Salem<br />respectively.</p>
<p>*Extremist activities: *Ashe was murdered in 1911 at Maniachi Railway<br />station by Vanchi Iyer, one of the patriots of Tamilnadu. Then, he shot<br />himself dead. The writings of Bharathi, the national poet kindled the<br />patriotic spirit of the people of Tamilnadu. V.V.S.Iyer started a Gurukulam<br />at Cheranmadevi to give training to the extremists.</p>
<p>*Home rule movement: *It was started by Dr.Annie Besant in 1916. She induced<br />the people through her patriotic ideas. She delivered her *37 *speeches at<br />Marina and Luz in Chennai. Her writings and speeches helped the freedom<br />fighters to achieve their goals. S.Subramaniya Iyer, Thiru V. Kalyana<br />Sundaranar and Dr.Varadarajulu Naidu and E.V.Ramasamy Naicker helped her to<br />promote the Home Rule ideas. C.Vijayaraghavachariyar, Thiru V.Kalyana<br />Sundaranar,</p>
<p>Varadharajulu Naidu, E.V.Ramasamy Naickear, S.Srinivasa Iyangar,<br />Sathyamurthy and K.Kamaraj were the leaders of the moderates. They played a<br />vital role in the freedom movement of Tamilnadu.</p>
<p>*Dr.Annie Besant*</p>
<p>*Dr. Annie Besant started 'Common Wheel'*</p>
<p>*and 'New India' newspapers .*</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>*The period from 1920-47 is called the era of Gandhiji in the history of*</p>
<p>*Indian National Movement.*</p>
<p>* *</p>
<p>*Non Co-operation Movement: *The people of Tamilnadu were angry with the<br />British Government because of the Rowlatt Act and Jallianwala Bagh tragedy<br />which occurred in 1919. Gandhiji moved the Non Co-operation resolution at<br />Nagpur Congress session. It was presided by C.Vijayaraghava Chariyar,<br />eminent Nationalist of Tamilnadu. Rajaji acted as the Lieutenent of<br />Gandhiji. He along with Sathyamurthy and E.V.Ramaswamy Naicker led the non<br />co-operation movement.</p>
<p>*Events of the non co-operation movement: *Rajaji was arrested and<br />imprisoned in Vellore jail. Agitations occurred in different places. The<br />leaders and the people boycotted the courts and the government offices. When<br />the Prince of Wales visited Madras in 1921,his visit was boycotted by the<br />congress leaders like Rajaji and Periyar. Agitations infront of toddy and<br />arrack shops were held in various places of Tamilnadu.</p>
<p>*Boycott of Simmon commission: *Under the leadership of Sathyamurthy Simon<br />commission was boycotted because there was no Indian member in it. In 1927,<br />the congress volunteers organised a Satyagraha for the removal of the Statue<br />of Colonel Neill (a tyrant of the 1857 Rebellion) errected at Madras. Many<br />were arrested. Yet the statue was broken. The statue was removed and kept in<br />the museum in 1937 when Rajaji became the premier of Madras.</p>
<p>*Civil Disobedience Movement*</p>
<p>* *</p>
<p>*Salt Satyagraha: *on March 1930, Gandhiji violated the salt laws at Dandi.<br />Simulataneously, in Tamilnadu Rajaji violated the salt laws at Vedaranyam .<br />Leaders like Sardar Vedharatanam Pillai, T.S.S.Rajan, Srimathi Ruckmani<br />Lakshmipathy took part in this salt satyagraha. It created awareness among<br />the people against the British Government.</p>
<p>Many people like Rajaji, K.Kamaraj were arrested when they disobeyed the<br />British government . *"No Tax Campaign" *was also conducted in many parts of<br />Tamilnadu. At Tirupur on 11th January 1932 the police attacked a procession<br />carrying National flags and singing national songs . As a result of the<br />lathi charge, Tirupur Kumaran, a freedom fighter sacrificed his life. He<br />demonstrated his patriotism by firmly holding the congress flag and shouting<br />Vande Mataram against the British. It was a deed of patriotism, heroism and<br />symbol of dedication.</p>
<p>*Tirupur Kumaran is popularly known as Kodikatha Kumaran*</p>
<p>As per the directions of Gandhiji individual satyagraha was followed by the<br />leaders of Tamilnadu. Many young leaders like Adikeasava Naicker, Salem Adi<br />Narayana chettiar, Guruswamy naidu, K.Kamaraj, Omandoor Ramasamy Reddiar,<br />Baktavatsalam, C.Subramaniyam and R.Venkatraman participated in the freedom<br />movement.</p>
<p>*Quit India movement: *The resolution of Quit India movement was passed at<br />Bombay congress session in 1942. On the advice of Gandhiji many leaders like<br />K.Kamaraj participated in the movement. Leaders like Muthuranga Mudaliar,<br />Baktavatsalam and R.Venkataraman were arrested. Disturbances spread all over<br />Tamilnadu in support of the freedom movement.</p>
<p>In Madras the agitators led the procession . They raised 'Quit India'<br />slogans, observed hartals and burnt the public offices. The workers of<br />Buckingham and Carnatic Mills and Madras Port Trust struck work. In North<br />Arcot the disturbances were severe. The agitators cut off telegraphic and<br />telephone lines. They also burnt the public buildings at Vellore and<br />Panapakkam. In South Arcot there were similar outbreaks. In Chidambaram,<br />Annamalai University students went on strike. Many patriots were killed at<br />Rajapalayam, Karaikudi, Devakottai, Tiruvadanai and Poolankuruchi. The<br />British took severe actions against the agitators.</p>
<p>* *</p>
<p>*India** towards Independence *: The Cripps and Cabinet Mission visited<br />India, and studied the condition. The interim government headed by Nehru<br />assumed the office and Rajaji became the Home Minister of India in 1946.<br />Mountbatten plan was accepted. The Indian Independence Act was passed in the<br />British Parliament. India attained independence from the clutches of the<br />British on 15th August 1947 after the heroic struggle.</p>
