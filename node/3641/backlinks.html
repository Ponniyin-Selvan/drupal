<p>when does a king become great?</p>
<p>the area he conquers???</p>
<p>then malik kafur qualifies though he wasnt a king</p>
<p>(and of course Rahul I sincerely beleive he saw lord shiva himself in <br />the madurai temple.)</p>
<p>if it is the code of laws a king formulates then ashoka or akbar <br />qualify.</p>
<p>if somebody becomes a great king without having come ina dynasty then <br />hyder ali,chatrapathi shivaji, and ranjit singh qualify.<br />because they all became kings on their merit rather than by right of <br />birth.</p>
<p>however since this group is about <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  we should let others know why we <br />feel he was great</acronym></p>
<p>let me take the first shot.</p>
<p>I THINK <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was great beacuse he let go his right to the throne even <br />when he was not sure it would come back to him.<br />to him, a sibling of very ambitious people it was a tremondous thing <br />to do<br />venketesh</acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  He was a great king but to call him "The Greatest" wouldn't be fair <br />to many<br />  others maybe "One of the greatest kings of India" would be an apt <br />phrase.<br />  Ashoka,the Mughals, the Pandyas (Im not giving up on that),the <br />Pallavas all<br />  were great in thier own way. Just because some of them weren't <br />documented<br />  doesn't mean they should be relegated to second grade.<br />  If this list can include great leaders then would Malik Kafur <br />qualify? He<br />  was a Gujurati afterall. Dont forget the Lord did not even come in <br />the<br />  dreams of all the great kings in this list but he let himself be <br />viewed by<br />  this temple destroyer. Is that a sign? This is more a doubt than a <br />point of<br />  view. I think Mr Venketesh can give us a good account on this.<br />  BTW Mr.Venketesh you are very special person in this Pandya <br />community. I<br />  still get dreams about "MADURAI"</p>

<p>I think the two sentences contradict each other.</p>
<p>Isn't it?</p>
<blockquote><p>  Here, do you mean pandyas were not brave?</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>oh, honestly, I do not know much about the Pandyas. I caught myself<br />thinking "Its heroic to defeat other heroes, but not so heroic to defeat<br />smaller men", when you said that the poets were humble to even respect<br />defeated enemies instead of belittling them.</p>
<p>I will give you another example. Lets say I'm a better programmer than<br />loosupaiyan loganathan (hypothetical loganathan ;). If you have to praise me<br />in front of SPS, you would have to say that I'm greater than Loganathan.<br />Then if you say that Loganathan is a loosupaiyan, would that add any value<br />to the praise you gave me? OTOH, if you say that Loganathan is a great<br />programmer who created the Apple corporation, and then you tell him than am<br />greater than Loganathan, *that* would add value to the praise.</p>

<p>CHERA CLAN - SENGUTTUVAN B/O ELANGOADIGL (AUTHOR : SILAPATHIGARAM) <br />ALSO BEEN TO NORTH AND BROUGHT THE STONE TO ERECT KANNAGI STATUE ..</p>
<p>THERE IS A POSTULATE THAT PANDYA KADUNGON WAS KALABRA ..</p>
<p>RE PALLAVAS : SIMHA VISHNU - " Jithath Simha Vishnu " - Rockfort <br />Trichy inscription - conquored Cauvery Delta. Another inscription <br />of Mahendra Varman - Jain converted Hindu - praising Cauvery at par <br />with Ganga and Uma sitting next to Siva to protect her interest ..! <br />Gunabaran terminology used in this Slokha is related to his <br />conversion and it is he who constructed Thiruvadhigai @ <br />Gunabareswaram / Near Pandruti. <br />Dr. Kalaikkovan has written quoted Rockfort inscriptions in his <br />Adyanthakamam.<br />Vaathapi Narasimha and Rajasimhan of Kanchi Kailasa Naathar temple <br />fame ..</p>
<p>Constructing a temple for KAILASANATHAR appears to be an obsession <br />for certain Kings ..</p>
<p>Himalayas - Siva - Parvathy - (Ganges of course) - with 5 small <br />mountains - Rivers including Saraswathi (antharvahini - not visible <br />to human eyes - but visible to Satellites ! ) - Imaging <br />Thirunavukkarsar talks of this in his hymns - Kabalikas / Bharivas <br />etc., to Sivanadiyar .. Which is what Kalki touched in his Novels ..</p>
<p>According to Dr. Kkvn - Rajasimha Pallava was a role model to RRC !</p>
<p>Even after discounting Thiruvalangadu copper plates - meyskeerthis <br />etc., - Avtar of Ram with Sanghu Chkra rekhas in both Hands - as <br />Dear Venkat Says - RRC brought Glory to Tamil Kings .. PLEASE <br />RECALL A STRONG TAMIL KING TEN CENTURIES BEFORE OF RRC's <br />CALIBRE ..WHICH KAMALAKKANNAN NICELY EVALUATED ..</p>
<p>Apart from Poilitcal rivalry - EMPERORS were considering their <br />Opponents with reverence and did not touch a single place of worship <br />of Inter-Regions - with very HIGH REGARD TO DEAR VENKAT - <br />MALIKAFUR is out of the list for this single reason !</p>
<p>Please go through Sundara Pandyan Meykeerthi : He destroyed every <br />single pillar in Chozha Empire after 400 yrs of vengance - BUT LEFT <br />THE 16 PILLAR MANDAPAM IN WHICH KARIKALAN GAVE AWAY PRESENTS TO <br />PATTINAPALAI AUTHOR UTHIRANKANNANAR !</p>
<p>HE GAVE GRANTS TO CHIDAMBARAM - SRIRANGAM (GOLDEN ROOF !) ETc., </p>
<p>WHEN WE HAD INFORMAL CHAT WITH DR. KKVN ABOUT 4 YRS BACK, he was <br />telling us : when we give a small gift - tube light - to a temple - <br />we put our name in the tube and in the frame !</p>
<p>This Person Rajaraja - has allowed all his people - including <br />servants to make grants and allowed everyone's name go into <br />History .. KODUPPAR KODUTHANAVUM ... Reason for Greatest ..</p>
<p>We have Scholars here .. Pls give us similar examples of Harshar - <br />Asokar - Chandraguptar .. Do we know their Chief Architect - <br />Engineer - servant - Village Sabha members ... No doubt Asoka's <br />renuciation after Kalinga war definitely places him in very High <br />Position in History ..</p>
<p>And that famous Sabha member requesting RRC to permit him light one <br />for RRC and RRC telling him to do for him and this man lighting TW0 -<br />.. Chingleput inscription ... !</p>
<p>My assumption is that because of Politcal compulsions, he was not on <br />the run till 985 AD - and it was Uthama who put the Crown on his <br />head - and till 1000 AD - settled old scores - like normal King - <br />then concentrated on developments - Accurate Survey and <br />classification of lands - Improving Panchayat system - IN <br />MONARCHY, PARTICIPATION OF VILLAGERS IN ADMINISTRATION (?) - PLS <br />QUOTE PARALLELS IN NORTH - excellent Revenue Administration - Land <br />Reclamation - Queens participating in Public auction - NOT ACQUIRING <br />LANDS BY GOVERNMENT ORDERS ! - AND leaving the Lands for Temple / <br />poor feeding, WOMEN LIBERATION - Art &amp; Architecture - from 1006 to <br />1012 and RELINQUISHED FROM ACTIVE POLITICS - during life time ...</p>
<p>PLEASE RE-READ UDAYARKUDI PALLIPADAYA ? IN <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com" title="www.varalaaru.com">www.varalaaru.com</a> First <br />issue ... It is not proved to be ..</p>
<p>BUT ONE INFORMATION IS THERE.</p>
<p>UDAYAR SREE RAJARAJA DEVAR EZHUNTHARULIYA MANDAPATHU THIRUMUNDRIL <br />was dilapidated ... and it was renovated in Kulothunga period by <br />the person after Performing Virudhams !</p>
<p>We Can understand RRC's Chief Architect Thennavan Moovenda Velalan - <br />who made all the 43 Idols in the Big temple - making a Brass Idol <br />of Rajaraja and placing it along with Sundarar .. naming this as <br />PERIYA DEVAR .. when RRC was alive ..</p>
<p>We Can understand this idol also being taken in front of Uthasavar <br />along with Chandrasekara murthy ..</p>
<p>We can understand Rajendra donating a Viboothi madal to Periyadevar <br />after RRC is demise ...Godifying him ..</p>
<p>All acts of Glorifying a King - Emperor - by his Kins ..</p>
<p>But after about 150 yrs - a warrior of Kulothunga renovating a <br />Mandap after performing Vridham .. what for ?</p>
<p>HE should have been seen more as a person Renounced worldly things <br />than as an Emperor .. </p>
<p>Sivapathasekaran</p>
<p>Can understand Rajendra</p></adhitha_karikalan@...></sps10142004@yahoo.co.in></p>
<blockquote><p>    should we only depend on the chola version for <br />    his life on the warfield. or should we not make<br />    a search for contradicting accounts from the<br />    opposite side too?</p>
<p>    my simple point is history should not be written<br />    by the victors alone.</p>
<p>  Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  Yes. You are correct. I agree with you. But, fortunately, we have <br />  records from both winners and losers in very few cases. Why not <br />  from each and every loser? It is not possible. Because, losers <br />  will always think about getting out to normal life as early as <br />  possible instead of recording the happenings.</p>
<p>  Every coin has 2 sides. We thamizh people celebrate the victories <br />  of Rajendran. But in north india, he is portrayed <br />as 'Kollaikkaran'. <br />  It is same as how we see Pulikesi. In case of Narasimma, there <br />  is no inscription in tamilnadu which states his vatapi invasion. <br />We <br />  know his victories only from the vatapi inscriptions.</p>
<p>  Another thing we need to understand is, all invasions need not <br />  be for wealth and expansion alone. It is also a duty for an <br />  emperor to ensure peace among his citizens and insist moral <br />  values among his neighbour kings. The article Pudhiraana <br />  pudhumai explains the reasons for all his invasions very well.</p>
<p>    In fact its mainly because of kalki that we dont get<br />    a real picture of the real RRc.it is the image shri.<br />    krinamurthy left us which is preventing us.</p>
<p>  I think this is our failure to understand kalki. We should always <br />  remember that kalki wrote a novel. Not history. He talked only <br />  about Arumozhi. Not RRC. All the incidents narrated by him need <br />  not be true. That is the freedom of a writer and kalki used this <br />  freedom to mix imagination in right proportion most effectively. <br />The <br />  varnanai 'Nilavai ponra mugam' is not kalki's imagination. It is <br />said <br />  in Thiruvalangadu copper plates. The transition from ps fan to <br />  history student will happen only if we understand these.</p>
<p>  All the historians and scholars we have met so far, told that RRC <br />  was introduced to them by Kalki only. And some say because of <br />  ps only they got interest in history. That is the greatness of <br />kalki.</p>
<p>  Thanks<br />  Kamal</p>

        <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I would like to argue to exclude Kulothungan I, as one of the attributes that qualifies to greatness is to leave a kingdom to their heirs which is stable, and allows then to expand and hence kulothungan cannot be ascribed with this yardstick</p>
<p><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  did leave behind a stable and wonderful launch pad for Rajendra to go about bringing down others.</p>
<p>In this case, we can include Mahendra Varma Pallavan, infact of getting defeated or blocked by pulikesi, he did leave a stable and a launch pad for Narasimha pallavan to build upon. Also Mahendra as a patron of arts did well to leave such ever lasting monuments, that we can feel proud to be a tamil.. </p>

<blockquote><p> At the same time, we could not blame KL for his<br /> handling of Vengi matters too because he wanted this<br /> country to be included as part of Tamilnadu. Had he<br /> succeeded in that effort, the coastal belt of present<br /> Andhra Pradesh would have been a pure Tamil country<br /> like Thondai mandalam. <br />=====================================</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a small doubt. Was Thondai mandalam also made<br />as "Tamil country"?</p>

<blockquote><p>    should we only depend on the chola version for <br />    his life on the warfield. or should we not make<br />    a search for contradicting accounts from the<br />    opposite side too?</p>
<p>    my simple point is history should not be written<br />    by the victors alone.</p>
<p>  Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  Yes. You are correct. I agree with you. But, fortunately, we have <br />  records from both winners and losers in very few cases. Why not <br />  from each and every loser? It is not possible. Because, losers <br />  will always think about getting out to normal life as early as <br />  possible instead of recording the happenings.</p>
<p>  Every coin has 2 sides. We thamizh people celebrate the victories <br />  of Rajendran. But in north india, he is portrayed <br />as 'Kollaikkaran'. <br />  It is same as how we see Pulikesi. In case of Narasimma, there <br />  is no inscription in tamilnadu which states his vatapi invasion. <br />We <br />  know his victories only from the vatapi inscriptions.</p>
<p>  Another thing we need to understand is, all invasions need not <br />  be for wealth and expansion alone. It is also a duty for an <br />  emperor to ensure peace among his citizens and insist moral <br />  values among his neighbour kings. The article Pudhiraana <br />  pudhumai explains the reasons for all his invasions very well.</p>
<p>    In fact its mainly because of kalki that we dont get<br />    a real picture of the real RRc.it is the image shri.<br />    krinamurthy left us which is preventing us.</p>
<p>  I think this is our failure to understand kalki. We should always <br />  remember that kalki wrote a novel. Not history. He talked only <br />  about Arumozhi. Not RRC. All the incidents narrated by him need <br />  not be true. That is the freedom of a writer and kalki used this <br />  freedom to mix imagination in right proportion most effectively. <br />The <br />  varnanai 'Nilavai ponra mugam' is not kalki's imagination. It is <br />said <br />  in Thiruvalangadu copper plates. The transition from ps fan to <br />  history student will happen only if we understand these.</p>
<p>  All the historians and scholars we have met so far, told that RRC <br />  was introduced to them by Kalki only. And some say because of <br />  ps only they got interest in history. That is the greatness of <br />kalki.</p>
<p>  Thanks<br />  Kamal</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<blockquote><p> At the same time, we could not blame KL for his<br /> handling of Vengi matters too because he wanted this<br /> country to be included as part of Tamilnadu.

<p>I have a small doubt. Was Thondai mandalam also made<br />as "Tamil country"?</p>

<p>Infact, in one of dr.Jaybee's email(not sure) I read that Angorwat is mostly pandya style architecture..Hats off to our anscestors.. </p>
<p>By trying to prove and compare who is the greatest, are we not trying to alienate each region individually.. </p>
<p>Balasubramani's email on the Hathikumba enscription, stated an alliance of tamil kings, but its like the Karavela has broken the same...</p>
<p>Why is that we never had a person(eg. Bismark) who could think in terms of bringing the warring factions together to make a larger homeland?</p>
<p>Can we not find the root cause for all this breakup and wars? </p>
<p>We as a civilization killed ourselves in petty wars and petty fights that we have lost our place in the sun..</p>
<p>coming back to the topic of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  being the greatest.. I am yet to be told of a single great pandya king(from 5th - 12th century AD).. Come on pandya naatu katrorare.. </p>
<p>Pallavas have left their glory in their temples all around Thondainaadu.. and even in the Sirapalli pillayar temple.. so who is the greatest of them all? Mamalla, Mahendra or Simha vishnu?</p>
<p>Come on guys, I am expecting a lively competition here... </p>

<p>Hi Nandakumar,</p>
<p>comparing the pandyas to roaches is like insulting ourselves.</p>
<p>first- pandyas managed to maintain a clear line of heirs under the <br />most adverse of conditions.</p>
<p>cholas did not go out in a fit of firing and glory. they just faded <br />away seeing before their eyes bits of their land being plucked away by <br />neigbours. the lethargy that set in after the great two and the <br />matriachial inheritance watered down their greatness.</p>
<p>pandyas beat the cholas hollow, razed their capital to the ground, <br />destroyed all their monuments, excepting places of religious and <br />literary importance. and even melted down every chola coin with a <br />tiger. thats one reason why we find very few chola coins around.</p>
<p>the turk was a great force from delhi. malik had finished off gujarat, <br />dwarasamudra, hoysalas, the warrangal rudras befor coming here. any <br />dynasty including the cholas at their peak could not have offered any <br />resisitance.</p>
<p>it just happened the pandyas had to face him<br />however after the pandyas initially retreated they did come back under <br />vikrama pandya's leadership and drove malik off.<br />the pandya kingdom continued for another decade before the second turk <br />invasion finished them off.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  when does a king become great?</p>
<p>  the area he conquers???</p>
<p>  then malik kafur qualifies though he wasnt a king</p>
<p>  (and of course Rahul I sincerely beleive he saw lord shiva himself <br />in <br />  the madurai temple.) </p>
<p>  if it is the code of laws a king formulates then ashoka or akbar <br />  qualify.</p>
<p>  if somebody becomes a great king without having come ina dynasty <br />then <br />  hyder ali,chatrapathi shivaji, and ranjit singh qualify. <br />  because they all became kings on their merit rather than by right of <br />  birth.</p>
<p>  however since this group is about rrc we should let others know why <br />we <br />  feel he was great</p>
<p>  let me take the first shot.</p>
<p>  I THINK RRC was great beacuse he let go his right to the throne even <br />  when he was not sure it would come back to him.<br />  to him, a sibling of very ambitious people it was a tremondous thing <br />  to do<br />  venketesh</p>

<p>    He was a great king but to call him "The Greatest" wouldn't be <br />fair <br />  to many<br />    others maybe "One of the greatest kings of India" would be an apt <br />  phrase.<br />    Ashoka,the Mughals, the Pandyas (Im not giving up on that),the <br />  Pallavas all<br />    were great in thier own way. Just because some of them weren't <br />  documented<br />    doesn't mean they should be relegated to second grade. <br />    If this list can include great leaders then would Malik Kafur <br />  qualify? He<br />    was a Gujurati afterall. Dont forget the Lord did not even come in <br />  the<br />    dreams of all the great kings in this list but he let himself be <br />  viewed by<br />    this temple destroyer. Is that a sign? This is more a doubt than a <br />  point of<br />    view. I think Mr Venketesh can give us a good account on this.<br />    BTW Mr.Venketesh you are very special person in this Pandya <br />  community. I<br />    still get dreams about "MADURAI"</p>

          I THINK rrc is great because......        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Actually I wanted argue for Kuloththungan-1 as a greatest King we have seen in Tamilnadu History because he, the only King ruled under centralised system from Godavari south bank to Ceylon and also It was the country that time was the biggest (and also Hindu kingdom) over other kingdoms in India. And no doubt, he was a real emperor in his times like Samudra Gupta or Akbar.</p>
<p>But Kamal's valuable points have changed my perception. KL has equalant qualities what <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  possess, but lacking in democratic process. Though he started the initiative for an independent ruling system in Madurai, he has not allowed the same in his paternal kingdom in Vengi and Ceylon where he appointed his own people as representative of him (like present day governors). <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  did not do this in Vengi and Celon.. He has handled the Vengi and Celon matters very very cleverly and this particular rajathandram is still valid. Here <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  scored over KL. </p>
<p>At the same time, we could not blame KL for his handling of Vengi matters too because he wanted this country to be included as part of Tamilnadu. Had he succeeded in that effort, the coastal belt of present Andhra Pradesh would have been a pure Tamil country like Thondai mandalam. He has even sent quite a number of Tamil population during his period to settle in godavari and krishna districts. So, it was a worth try.</p>
<p>Meykiirthis are valid points to consider as proof.</p>

<p>Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I was afraid that people may skip my mail <br />because of its length.</p>
<p>Out of 6 points, only the first one talks about meikeerthi. So far, <br />we haven't come across any evidence stating that meikeerthi was sung <br />before the king every day. OK. For the sake of argument, let us <br />assume that meikeerthi was sung before the king daily and <br />possess 'Uyarvu navirchi ani'. It should have been sung before <br />Rajendra and his descendants also, right? Even if we assume the <br />entire meikeerthi as poikeerthi and do not count on the victories <br />listed, doesn't the polite words show his humanity? The poets could <br />have used some funny or impolite words about pandyas and sinhalese <br />to impress <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  if they possess sychophancy. Isn't it? What could <br />have stopped them to insult core enemies when there is a golden <br />opportunity, which can impress the king directly?</acronym></p>
<p><acronym title="In my humble opinion" IMHO</acronym , meikeerthi is not a 'Pugazh maalai'. It is nothing but a <br />visiting card.</acronym></p>

          I THINK rrc is great because......        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>-Dear Kamal</p>
<p>if we were all not fans of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  we wouldnt be here in the first place.</p>
<p>he was a phenomenal man , one who has left his mark a millenium hence.</p>
<p>but the point as I said is we should attempt to derive a real <br />charecter map of him</p>
<p>In fact its mainly because of kalki that we dont get a real picture of <br />the real <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym .it is the image shri. krinamurthy left us which is <br />preventing us.<br />reading <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  ,I still imagine <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  with a baby face and large biceps( <br />that itself is a paradox)</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>I am not doubting his meikeerthi at all. because we know when he died <br />he was literally undefeated.</p>
<p>but how good was he during the conquests. once again shri krinamurthy <br />clouds our understanding. he goes out of the way to say grains were <br />sent for the invading chola army in lanka. if they were so good why <br />conquer at all.</p>
<p>should we only depend on the chola version for his life on the <br />warfield. or should we not make a search for contradicting accounts <br />from the opposite side too?</p>
<p>my simple point is history should not be written by the victors alone.</p>
<p>regards<br />venketesh</p></acronym></p>

<p>that was a very nice justification. but arent we depending on the <br />meikeerthi too much. meikeerthi is something they might have sung <br />before the king himself daily. and our lands are known for sychophancy <br />thro the ages.</p>
<p>( for example in kachur near madras a small chieftain called gopala <br />thevar inscribes himself as "THirubuvana chakravarthi") and inside the <br />temple there is a kalvettu of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  himself.</p>
<p>but can the experts in the group list <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's achivements in different <br />fields. that would enable a lot of people to judge for themselves</acronym></p>
<p>his conquests and victories in the battle field<br />his achievements in architecture<br />his people friendly laws and justice etc and any other things you <br />might think of</p>
<p>but the first question is what did <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  conquer( in terms of kingdoms)</p>

<p>    Dear Kamal</p>
<p>    can you quote from that article to substantiate your point.<br />    would be most helpful.</p>
<p>    I think at the end of this discussion we would have<br />    finished a full charecter mapping of rrc.</p>
<p>  Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  Here are my points.</p>
<p>  1. Manidha neyam</p>
<p>  We are talking about looting and it is justified as way of relief <br />  for soldiers. Narasimma pallavan's army looted vatapi. Adhitha <br />  karikalan's army looted madurai. Rajendran's and his sons' armies <br />  looted north india. But, in case of Rajaraja, there was only one <br />  looting. Udhakai. The title given by later period poets 'Udhakai <br />  thee uyththa uravon' has no place in his meikeerthi. The udhakai <br />  invasion was not for capturing. It is just for punishing the king <br />  who got deviated from norms. You can compare Rajendra and his sons' <br />  meikeerthi with RRC's. While other meikeerthi talks about their <br />  lootings and 'nose-cuts', 'Thirumagal pola' poetically lists the <br />  victories chronologically. This means he never encouraged lootings. <br />  Even the 'paramparai' enemies pandyas and sinhalese are mentioned <br />  without any insulting intention. 'Murattezhil singalavar' <br />  and 'Chezhiyarai dhesu kol'. How can core enemies be addressed more <br />  honorific than this? Not only the 'hollywood speeches' recharge the <br />  soldiers. Dedicating victory to soldiers would also cheer them up!</p>
<p>  2. King lived for people</p>
<p>  The vallam inscriptions talk about a village administrative officer <br />  who met the emperor. Most of you may know this already. But i am <br />  explaining here just for compiling RRC's merits. The VAO met RRC and <br />  asked for 'nivandham' to light lamp in his village for the king to <br />  live long and give 'nallaatchi'. RRC replied that people are the <br />  backbone of government and asked him to light the lamp in the name <br />  of village people instead of the king and donated some money and <br />  goats. After returning to his village, the VAO started lighting 2 <br />  lamps in the name of king as well as village people. Out of his busy <br />  schedule of continuous wars and massive temple constructions, he <br />  thought about people and their welfare.</p>
<p>  3. Distributed power centers</p>
<p>  This is the wonder of democracy in monocracy. India is such a large <br />  country, which cannot be ruled by a single person. I think this is <br />  what Rajendra and his sons failed to understand which lead to <br />  decline of chola dynasty. RRC was well aware of this. So, he <br />  surveyed the entire kingdom, splitted into many divisions and <br />  appointed administrative officers on rotation basis. Defined set of <br />  norms for each department. Scandals and bribes were found <br />  immediately by excellent spy network. Defaulters were punished <br />  without any exception. Even when an officer takes leave or retires <br />  or dies, the method to choose the person to take in-charge was also <br />  well drafted. Well planned administration. 'Nivandhams' were closely <br />  watched and revoked when misused. Administration of akbar can come <br />  only next to RRC.</p>
<p>  4. Peridhinum peridhu kEl</p>
<p>  He may be ambitious and egoist. But nobody is better example for <br />  Bharathi's 'Peridhinum peridhu kel' and Abdul kalam's 'Kanavu <br />  kaanungal' than RRC. He dreamt big. We got the wonderful temple. <br />  When we were sitting next to the kalasam, we became speechless and <br />  breatheless. Not because of height. Even the 1000 feet Tokyo tower <br />  didn’t give this much impact in my mind. That time everyone <br />thought <br />  the same, but couldn’t share with others. Just understood by <br />seeing <br />  others' faces. We feel great just by climbing to the top. But he <br />  dreamt, planned and executed. He is the man who achieved this. How <br />  would have he felt? Nobody can imagine. Though i am not 100% sure, I <br />  think that was the tallest building in the world at that time, when <br />  the citizens of present day developed nation were barbarians. Slaves <br />  might have been used for bringing stones from various places. But <br />  without giving due respect and attention to sculptures and <br />  architects, such wonder wouldn't have been possible at all. The <br />  saying 'Kasaiyadi koduthu kavidhai vaanga mudiyaathu' perfectly fits <br />  for all forms of art. The modern management principle 'Unless the <br />  leader is dedicated and gives importance to his duty, the <br />  productivity of people working under him cannot be high' holds good <br />  for the case of building such architectural wonder also.</p>
<p>  5. Right to get information</p>
<p>  Right from his meikeerthi to his last reginal year inscription in <br />  periya koyil, it is evident that he wanted to give transparent <br />  administration which was less in the period of other kings. <br />  Inscriptions and copper plates play major role in drafting history. <br />  For whom these inscriptions are useful? Only for historians and <br />  people like us who are interested in history? This was the way to <br />  announce happenings in kingdom to common people and inscribed where <br />  people assemble frequently. Though major portion of inscriptions <br />  talk about grants, the historical facts are hidden in that. Let me <br />  give an example. Today, when we register a sale of house, we mention <br />  the location of that house by providing the details of each <br />  neighbour. If we collect all the sale deeds of that village from <br />  registrar office, we can find out who was living in which house and <br />  when. That is how history is filtered from various inscriptions. One <br />  of the rare social inscriptions 'Thalichery kalvettu' exclusively <br />  talks about the details of allotment of houses to ladies who <br />  involved in activities of big temple. As far as i know, there is no <br />  such detailed inscription by any other king.</p>
<p>  6. Selflessness</p>
<p>  He never owned any pride by himself alone. Let it be the victory in <br />  wars or grants to temples. Grants of everyone for temples he built <br />  is documented in excellent way. Not only big temple. Thiruvalanjuzhi <br />  is also another feather in his crown. Even the grant of golden <br />  flowers by maid of queen. Imagine if a maid of queen can donate some <br />  golden flowers, how would have been the economy of the kingdom. <br />  Sometimes back, there was a discussion about increasing tax for <br />  building temples. That wouldn't have happened in case of big temple. <br />  If the temple was built from people's money, then why should the <br />  king and common people donate separately and they are documented?</p>
<p>  The last point is, about the available information on other kings of <br />  india. I agree that we should not underrate a king just because of <br />  not having any record. But only if we have proper evidences, we can <br />  say it as a fact. Otherwise, it would be mere fiction. Those <br />  assumptions cannot come under history. As of now, we have enough <br />  evidences to prove RRC as 'The Greatest' king of India. The validity <br />  period of this conclusion expires when another king is proved <br />  as 'The Greatest' with proper evidences.</p>
<p>  Thanks<br />  Kamal</p>

<p>one mans bread is another man's poison<br />one man's hero is surely another's villian.</p>
<p>even in this forum we have heard of chalukya history terming pallavas <br />as dastardly looters</p>
<p>I am sure the ceylonese chronicles will not appreciate the role of <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym ( like kalki did).</p>
<p>remember siruthodar ( one of the 63)even looted a pillaiyar from <br />vatapi<br />looting was a form of funding warfare. every king who went to war <br />looted and burnt down cities.</p>

<p>Regarding cockroaches, i am sure almost everybody knows that the cockroach<br />is the only being which can live longest without its head. Even though<br />insulting dont you think this is similar to the Pandya clan. These guys even<br />after thier kings (head) had been slain managed to regroup and come back<br />strongly.Roaches are the hardest insects to kill.</p>
<p>The roaches also have a tendency to "generate" resistance mechanisms to<br />whatever new pesticides man invents. If a pesticide is used for a longtime<br />on thier clan they tend to start developing thier own mechanisms to resist<br />those. fascinating insect!! Sorry to digress but blame Nanda! ;) ;)</p>

<p>  while on the subject of cock roaches let me add some trivia</p>
<p>  The cockroach is also one of the hardiest insects on the planet, It is<br />  popularly suggested that cockroaches will "inherit the earth" after<br />  humanity destroys itself in a nuclear war. Cockroaches do indeed have<br />  a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrates, with the lethal<br />  dose perhaps 6 to 15 times that for humans.</p>
<p>  Some of the earliest writings with regards to cockroaches encourage<br />  their use as medicine. Pedanius Dioscorides (1st century), Kamal al-<br />  Din al-Damiri and Abu Hanifa ad-Dainuri (9th century) all offered<br />  medicines that either suggest grinding them up with oil or boiling.<br />  The list of ailments included earaches, open wounds and<br />  "gynaecological disorders".</p>

<p>      Hi all;       Looks like a good arguement is going. I am glad i started it from<br />      MrVenketesh's mail. Oru Narathar feeling irukku "Narayana,<br />  Narayana"</p>
<p>      I think we are digressing towards who is greater Pandyas or Cholas<br />  instead<br />      of sticking to the main issue which is "is RRC great or THE<br />  GREATEST"</p>
<p>      "THE GREATEST" is not a correct term when we are comparing kings<br />  from<br />      different eras, who had different types of opponents, who had<br />  access to<br />      different levels of technical skills. Kings before RRC might not<br />  have had<br />      access to stone building techniques so thier super structures<br />  built of<br />      mud/clay would have been destroyed over time. These<br />  superstructures could<br />      have been bigger and more beautiful than whatever RRC built.<br />  Remember<br />      mud/clay is easier to mould into complex shapes than stone<br />  carving, hence<br />      the complexities of structures then would have been greater. This<br />  is just an<br />      example of the issue.<br />      All i am saying is we cant just grant RRC the title "THE<br />  GREATEST".<br />      He has an unfair advantage over his compatriots in a lot of things<br />  also<br />      RRC had the The Incomparable Amarar Kalki writing about him and<br />  introducing<br />      him to a whole new generation centuries after his death. Regarding<br />  RRC<br />      looking like "the moon has come to earth" (that article in<br />  varalaaru), I<br />      think we had a discussion regarding how RRC looked like a Mongol<br />  with slit<br />      eyes,etc. Hope Mr Venketesh can back me up on this.<br />      RRC is surely one of the greatest kings to have ruled India/TN. We<br />  cant<br />      give the title "The Greatest" as it is a comparision of different<br />  eras.</p>

<p>rahul when we pandyans win you want to put nanda in a paathaala <br />sirai and throw in a lot of cock roaches right? see I read your mind</p>
<p>while on the subject of cock roaches let me add some trivia</p>
<p>The cockroach is also one of the hardiest insects on the planet, It is <br />popularly suggested that cockroaches will "inherit the earth" after <br />humanity destroys itself in a nuclear war. Cockroaches do indeed have <br />a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrates, with the lethal <br />dose perhaps 6 to 15 times that for humans.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest writings with regards to cockroaches encourage <br />their use as medicine. Pedanius Dioscorides (1st century), Kamal al-<br />Din al-Damiri and Abu Hanifa ad-Dainuri (9th century) all offered <br />medicines that either suggest grinding them up with oil or boiling. <br />The list of ailments included earaches, open wounds and <br />"gynaecological disorders".</p>
<p>( sorry moderator, but nanda brought up the roach issue first )</p>
<p>venketesh</p>

<p>    Hi all;     Looks like a good arguement is going. I am glad i started it from<br />    MrVenketesh's mail. Oru Narathar feeling irukku "Narayana, <br />Narayana"</p>
<p>    I think we are digressing towards who is greater Pandyas or Cholas <br />instead<br />    of sticking to the main issue which is "is RRC great or THE <br />GREATEST"</p>
<p>    "THE GREATEST" is not a correct term when we are comparing kings <br />from<br />    different eras, who had different types of opponents, who had <br />access to<br />    different levels of technical skills. Kings before RRC might not <br />have had<br />    access to stone building techniques so thier super structures <br />built of<br />    mud/clay would have been destroyed over time. These <br />superstructures could<br />    have been bigger and more beautiful than whatever RRC built. <br />Remember<br />    mud/clay is easier to mould into complex shapes than stone <br />carving, hence<br />    the complexities of structures then would have been greater. This <br />is just an<br />    example of the issue.<br />    All i am saying is we cant just grant RRC the title "THE <br />GREATEST".<br />    He has an unfair advantage over his compatriots in a lot of things <br />also<br />    RRC had the The Incomparable Amarar Kalki writing about him and <br />introducing<br />    him to a whole new generation centuries after his death. Regarding <br />RRC<br />    looking like "the moon has come to earth" (that article in <br />varalaaru), I<br />    think we had a discussion regarding how RRC looked like a Mongol <br />with slit<br />    eyes,etc. Hope Mr Venketesh can back me up on this.<br />    RRC is surely one of the greatest kings to have ruled India/TN. We <br />cant<br />    give the title "The Greatest" as it is a comparision of different <br />eras.</p>

<p>Thanks dear Kamal sir</p>
<p>thats what mr.rahul tries to state unless until u dont know abt one it is<br />quite unfair to underrate them.</p>
<p>regarding sacrifice of the throne there is definitely some under current its<br />my gut feeling only.</p>
<p>i feel shima vishnu , kadungon pandian, and nedumaran must have their<br />definite share on the list.</p>

<p>  Hello MrVenketesh;  <br />  I dont think RRC can be called "The Greatest" ofcourse he was great but<br />  not the greatest. That title "The Greatest" should go to the kings who got<br />  the throne on merit rather than by right. Would Arulmozhi have become a king<br />  if he had started at the bottom of the food chain?<br />  I personally rate Malik Kafur very high in this list(influenced by<br />  MrVenketesh, all u Malik Kafur haters can take it out on him ;) )</p>
<p>  Also isn't our imagination of RRC very much influenced by Kalki?</p>

<p>    Hi all</p>
<p>    when does a king become great?</p>
<p>    the area he conquers???</p>
<p>    then malik kafur qualifies though he wasnt a king</p>
<p>    (and of course Rahul I sincerely beleive he saw lord shiva himself in<br />    the madurai temple.)</p>
<p>    if it is the code of laws a king formulates then ashoka or akbar<br />    qualify.</p>
<p>    if somebody becomes a great king without having come ina dynasty then<br />    hyder ali,chatrapathi shivaji, and ranjit singh qualify.<br />    because they all became kings on their merit rather than by right of<br />    birth.</p>
<p>    however since this group is about rrc we should let others know why we<br />    feel he was great</p>
<p>    let me take the first shot.</p>
<p>    I THINK RRC was great beacuse he let go his right to the throne even<br />    when he was not sure it would come back to him.<br />    to him, a sibling of very ambitious people it was a tremondous thing<br />    to do<br />    venketesh</p>

<p>      He was a great king but to call him "The Greatest" wouldn't be fair<br />    to many<br />      others maybe "One of the greatest kings of India" would be an apt<br />    phrase.<br />      Ashoka,the Mughals, the Pandyas (Im not giving up on that),the<br />    Pallavas all<br />      were great in thier own way. Just because some of them weren't</p>
<p>    documented<br />      doesn't mean they should be relegated to second grade.<br />      If this list can include great leaders then would Malik Kafur<br />    qualify? He<br />      was a Gujurati afterall. Dont forget the Lord did not even come in<br />    the<br />      dreams of all the great kings in this list but he let himself be<br />    viewed by<br />      this temple destroyer. Is that a sign? This is more a doubt than a<br />    point of<br />      view. I think Mr Venketesh can give us a good account on this.<br />      BTW Mr.Venketesh you are very special person in this Pandya<br />    community. I<br />      still get dreams about "MADURAI"</p>

<p>the pandyas were indeeactive during the period you mention till <br />atleast the rise of the cholas.</p>

          I THINK rrc is great because......        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>i AGREE with most of the your email.. I was providing a metaphor and was not equating pandyas to roaches.. </p>
<p>Infact, in one of dr.Jaybee's email(not sure) I read that Angorwat is mostly pandya style architecture..Hats off to our anscestors.. </p>
<p>By trying to prove and compare who is the greatest, are we not trying to alienate each region individually.. </p>
<p>Balasubramani's email on the Hathikumba enscription, stated an alliance of tamil kings, but its like the Karavela has broken the same...</p>
<p>Why is that we never had a person(eg. Bismark) who could think in terms of bringing the warring factions together to make a larger homeland?</p>
<p>Can we not find the root cause for all this breakup and wars? </p>
<p>We as a civilization killed ourselves in petty wars and petty fights that we have lost our place in the sun..</p>
<p>coming back to the topic of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  being the greatest.. I am yet to be told of a single great pandya king(from 5th - 12th century AD).. Come on pandya naatu katrorare.. </p>
<p>Pallavas have left their glory in their temples all around Thondainaadu.. and even in the Sirapalli pillayar temple.. so who is the greatest of them all? Mamalla, Mahendra or Simha vishnu?</p>
<p>Come on guys, I am expecting a lively competition here... </p>

<p>Hi Nandakumar,</p>
<p>comparing the pandyas to roaches is like insulting ourselves.</p>
<p>first- pandyas managed to maintain a clear line of heirs under the <br />most adverse of conditions.</p>
<p>cholas did not go out in a fit of firing and glory. they just faded <br />away seeing before their eyes bits of their land being plucked away by <br />neigbours. the lethargy that set in after the great two and the <br />matriachial inheritance watered down their greatness.</p>
<p>pandyas beat the cholas hollow, razed their capital to the ground, <br />destroyed all their monuments, excepting places of religious and <br />literary importance. and even melted down every chola coin with a <br />tiger. thats one reason why we find very few chola coins around.</p>
<p>the turk was a great force from delhi. malik had finished off gujarat, <br />dwarasamudra, hoysalas, the warrangal rudras befor coming here. any <br />dynasty including the cholas at their peak could not have offered any <br />resisitance.</p>
<p>it just happened the pandyas had to face him<br />however after the pandyas initially retreated they did come back under <br />vikrama pandya's leadership and drove malik off.<br />the pandya kingdom continued for another decade before the second turk <br />invasion finished them off.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  when does a king become great?</p>

<p>  then malik kafur qualifies though he wasnt a king</p>
<p>  (and of course Rahul I sincerely beleive he saw lord shiva himself <br />in <br />  the madurai temple.) </p>
<p>  if it is the code of laws a king formulates then ashoka or akbar <br />  qualify.</p>
<p>  if somebody becomes a great king without having come ina dynasty <br />then <br />  hyder ali,chatrapathi shivaji, and ranjit singh qualify. <br />  because they all became kings on their merit rather than by right of <br />  birth.</p>
<p>  however since this group is about rrc we should let others know why <br />we <br />  feel he was great</p>
<p>  let me take the first shot.</p>
<p>  I THINK RRC was great beacuse he let go his right to the throne even <br />  when he was not sure it would come back to him.<br />  to him, a sibling of very ambitious people it was a tremondous thing <br />  to do<br />  venketesh</p>

        <p>Hi Rahul</p>
<p>You can call me Nanda..you can drop of "Mr." Lets not digress from the topic in hand.... </p>
<p>Roaches story was meant to whip up the passion.. ;)</p>
<p>Greatness is attributed to Kings, who are able to leave a lasting impression in the minds of the people through their deeds, uncompromising justice, giving unhindered peace, people who are able to improve the life of all and sundry in their domains and make a difference in the altering the history.</p>
<p>Is Ivan called "Ivan the great" no, he is called "ivan the terrible"? lets look around, even Queen victoria is not called the Great.. she had an empire on which the sun never set... </p>
<p>Akbar, Ashoka, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , Shivaji</p>
<p>Kulothangan I ruled for 50 years, but he is never ascribed to the title "Great" .. likewise Rajendra I, acheived more land..but he was continuing what his father did.. and hence he is not given the title Great..</p>

        <p>Hi Nandakumar,</p>
<p>comparing the pandyas to roaches is like insulting ourselves.</p>
<p>first- pandyas managed to maintain a clear line of heirs under the <br />most adverse of conditions.</p>
<p>cholas did not go out in a fit of firing and glory. they just faded <br />away seeing before their eyes bits of their land being plucked away by <br />neigbours. the lethargy that set in after the great two and the <br />matriachial inheritance watered down their greatness.</p>
<p>pandyas beat the cholas hollow, razed their capital to the ground, <br />destroyed all their monuments, excepting places of religious and <br />literary importance. and even melted down every chola coin with a <br />tiger. thats one reason why we find very few chola coins around.</p>
<p>the turk was a great force from delhi. malik had finished off gujarat, <br />dwarasamudra, hoysalas, the warrangal rudras befor coming here. any <br />dynasty including the cholas at their peak could not have offered any <br />resisitance.</p>
<p>it just happened the pandyas had to face him<br />however after the pandyas initially retreated they did come back under <br />vikrama pandya's leadership and drove malik off.<br />the pandya kingdom continued for another decade before the second turk <br />invasion finished them off.<br />venketesh</p>

        <p>Dear MrNandakumar; &lt;<Somebody said outlast the cholas   That was me<br />You are comparing this modern day Chola-Pandya battle with Dinosaurs vs<br />Cockroaches. There is a small scientifc community in this group comprising<br />of doctors, they would tell you that cockroaches were indeed greater than<br />Dinosaurs. It dont outlast the dinosaurs by one or two generations but by<br />millions of years. The cockroach will probably outlast mankind and womankind<br />(i dont want to get into that arguement!).</somebody></p>
<p>*Verdict cockroaches were greater than Dinousaurs. Cockroaches are greater<br />than Cholas, Pandyas, Pallavas, Cheras put-together ;) ;)<br />*</p>
<p>Somebody said outlast the cholas.. I have a point to prove, the roaches did<br />outlast the dinosaurs.. does that mean roaches are the greatest??</p>
<p>nay... people become great by their deeds.. lets see if we can find a<br />pandiya apart from the known sundara pandiya or mara varma, are there any<br />other pandiyas worth mentioning...

        <p>Somebody said outlast the cholas.. I have a point to prove, the roaches did outlast the dinosaurs.. does that mean roaches are the greatest?? </p>
<p>nay... people become great by their deeds.. lets see if we can find a pandiya apart from the known sundara pandiya or mara varma, are there any other pandiyas worth mentioning... Pandiyas outdid themselves by going to the turks for the race to the throne, unlike cholas who had lost to troika of kings.. so who is the greatest in losing it?</p>
<p>:) Iets see if we can find the chola, pandiya &amp; pallava people joining the fights.</p>

          I THINK rrc is great because......        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi all</p>
<p>when does a king become great?</p>
<p>the area he conquers???</p>
<p>then malik kafur qualifies though he wasnt a king</p>
<p>(and of course Rahul I sincerely beleive he saw lord shiva himself in <br />the madurai temple.)</p>
<p>if it is the code of laws a king formulates then ashoka or akbar <br />qualify.</p>
<p>if somebody becomes a great king without having come ina dynasty then <br />hyder ali,chatrapathi shivaji, and ranjit singh qualify.<br />because they all became kings on their merit rather than by right of <br />birth.</p>
<p>however since this group is about <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  we should let others know why we <br />feel he was great</acronym></p>
<p>let me take the first shot.</p>
<p>I THINK <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  was great beacuse he let go his right to the throne even <br />when he was not sure it would come back to him.<br />to him, a sibling of very ambitious people it was a tremondous thing <br />to do<br />venketesh</acronym></p>

<blockquote><p>  He was a great king but to call him "The Greatest" wouldn't be fair <br />to many<br />  others maybe "One of the greatest kings of India" would be an apt <br />phrase.<br />  Ashoka,the Mughals, the Pandyas (Im not giving up on that),the <br />Pallavas all<br />  were great in thier own way. Just because some of them weren't <br />documented<br />  doesn't mean they should be relegated to second grade.<br />  If this list can include great leaders then would Malik Kafur <br />qualify? He<br />  was a Gujurati afterall. Dont forget the Lord did not even come in <br />the<br />  dreams of all the great kings in this list but he let himself be <br />viewed by<br />  this temple destroyer. Is that a sign? This is more a doubt than a <br />point of<br />  view. I think Mr Venketesh can give us a good account on this.<br />  BTW Mr.Venketesh you are very special person in this Pandya <br />community. I<br />  still get dreams about "MADURAI"</p>
