<blockquote><p>  Hi Friend:<br />  ?<br />  Do you know that there is a version that "Tirupathi Balaji" is not reallya vaishnavite temple? but the original deity is only?Murugan.? And that is why Tamil Leaders like the late?Ma Po Sivagnanam and others?wereferocisouly fighting with the Govt of India to retain Tirupati and Tiruttani with Tamilnadu when state boundaries were redrawn after Independence. <br />  ?<br />  It is said that centuries back, when the saivite and vaishnavite war was going on, to retain Tirupathi as a vaishnavite shrine, some secret plans were?made to show that the original deity is Balaji and that is why?a big?Thirunamam was put up? to cover up his face!? But one of my uncles says that it is neither Balaji nor Murugan but only Ambal! Ambal's face?iscovered up with lot of decorations including the Thirunamam !? He tells me that many years back, on a very rare occasion, alongwith friends he had the opportunity to take darshan of the deity when?all the abhishekams were performed and at that time they were able to find out the truth!? Now you can't even stand a few seconds near the sanctum sanctorum which is?another story!??<br />  ?<br />  veegopalji@...</p>

        <p>Ravi, I certainly agree with you on the civility of the crowd, whether it is Tirupathi or elsewhere. Civility unfortunately is tied to literacy and culture and it is difficult to enforce in a country with over 1 billion. </p>
<p>Some places do try though - Kerala temples for instance have a very strict dress code. Free prasad can be something the person gets while passing through the doorway so that no duplicate or asking more is possible. 80% of darshan may be free but perhaps for a fraction of a second, I do not deny the crowd but is it possible to issue tickets or timings when people can come and go instead of standing in line forever and pushed through without a chance to take even a second look.</p>
<p>I am not at all implying anything is easy but if we do not try nothing is possible. while individual responsiblity is undeniable, the people who hold the responsiblity for managing the Lord's finances cannot just get away by saying the Lord brings in the money -and pander to celebrities in the process. There is surely more accountability to it than that.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>    ..how should temple funds be managed? What should be done with funds over and above temple upkeep? Is it ok to treat a temple as a commercial establishment totally (or does anyone feel there are some differences?</p>
<p>    Hi maloo<br />    you question would need to be answered with the context of history, politics and economics.</p>
<p>    first history<br />    the temples were probably owned by the kings who vanished with the advent of british. those who went along with them still retain the temples likesivaganga, ramnad and pudukottai.</p>
<p>     the next are well established adheenams which own temples for several centuries. the british were good enough not to disturb them.<br />    some large temples like vaitheeswaran koil, thirukadayur, thirunallar are owned by adheenams.</p>
<p>    these adheenams have a free hand to spend the money they receive I guess. they run colleges and choultries too.<br />    a majority of temples however had no owners since the kings vanished.<br />    example kapali temple, or thiruvallikeni for that matter.<br />    so the government owns them for some centuries.</p>
<p>    the tamilnadu temples own huge amounts of land. these lands are held byboth poor peasants as well as powerful land sharks. its a huge political desicion which is required to get them back.needs a lot of back bone. <br />    people are very angry that the HR&amp;CE is literally looting the temples<br />    however i feel inspite of the governmental control and to an extent looting of the income,<br />    1.there is a degree of security for these temples, (people sometimes respect the government more than god- that arasan andre kolluvaan thievam nindru kollum example)</p>
<p>    2lesser bickering for their ownerships between locals.( this would haveled to large scale violence and feuds- a small example is kandadevi templewhich flares up every year)<br />    i am sure many including sathish kumar arunachalam will not agree . lets see the others viewpoint too now.</p>

<p>        TIRUMALA: The global meltdown has rocked the economies of several countries, toppling business establishments and pushing leading financial institutions to the verge of collapse . But the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, the sole custodian of the Venkateswara temple, remains `unscathed.' The lion's share of the income of the TTD is derived from the hundi, in which devotees deposit their offerings. Over Rs.521 crore is expected from the hundi during 2009-10 out of the total revenue of Rs.1,363 crore. The hundi contributes slightly above 38 % of the net proceeds of the TTD. Besides, goingby TTD records the hundi income has registered a steady increase of 10-15 % every year over the past four decades. The hundi income from January 2009to March 9 is put as Rs.40.69 crore, Rs.34.87 crore and Rs.40.90 crore as against Rs.36.13 crore, Rs.33.76 crore and Rs.37.76 crore for the corresponding period during 2008.</p></vj.episteme@></p></abhivencat@></p></blockquote>

        <p>Dear SPS<br />??? The answer to your qn. is Yes. Thanjavor Samastanams have 64 temples under their direct supervison and 63 gardens? in various places for the temples and 20 chatrams for the devotees. The list of temples and placesare long and this mail box is not sufficient for that.<br />Anbudan<br />Vishwak</p>

<p>SPS - does tanjoer samasthanam own temples?</p>
<p>Nisumbasoodhani - nearby Vaidhyanathar temple - Mariamman, nearby perumal and other temples are under the control of Thanjai Aranmanai devasthanam.</p>

<p>  Hi maloo<br />  you question would need to be answered with the context of history, politics and economics.</p>
<p>  first history<br />  the temples were probably owned by the kings who vanished with the adventof british. those who went along with them still retain the temples like sivaganga, ramnad and pudukottai.</p>
<p>   the next are well established adheenams which own temples for several centuries. the british were good enough not to disturb them.<br />  some large temples like vaitheeswaran koil, thirukadayur, thirunallar areowned by adheenams.</p>
<p>  these adheenams have a free hand to spend the money they receive I guess.they run colleges and choultries too.<br />  a majority of temples however had no owners since the kings vanished.<br />  example kapali temple, or thiruvallikeni for that matter.<br />  so the government owns them for some centuries.</p>
<p>  the tamilnadu temples own huge amounts of land. these lands are held by both poor peasants as well as powerful land sharks. its a huge political desicion which is required to get them back.needs a lot of back bone. <br />  people are very angry that the HR&amp;CE is literally looting the temples<br />  however i feel inspite of the governmental control and to an extent looting of the income,<br />  1.there is a degree of security for these temples, (people sometimes respect the government more than god- that arasan andre kolluvaan thievam nindru kollum example)</p>
<p>  2lesser bickering for their ownerships between locals.( this would have led to large scale violence and feuds- a small example is kandadevi temple which flares up every year)<br />  i am sure many including sathish kumar arunachalam will not agree . lets see the others viewpoint too now.</p>

<p>      TIRUMALA: The global meltdown has rocked the economies of several countries, toppling business establishments and pushing leading financial institutions to the verge of collapse . But the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams,the sole custodian of the Venkateswara temple, remains `unscathed.' The lion's share of the income of the TTD is derived from the hundi, in which devotees deposit their offerings. Over Rs.521 crore is expected from the hundiduring 2009-10 out of the total revenue of Rs.1,363 crore. The hundi contributes slightly above 38 % of the net proceeds of the TTD. Besides, going by TTD records the hundi income has registered a steady increase of 10-15 % every year over the past four decades. The hundi income from January 2009 to March 9 is put as Rs.40.69 crore, Rs.34.87 crore and Rs.40.90 crore as against Rs.36.13 crore, Rs.33.76 crore and Rs.37.76 crore for the corresponding period during 2008.</p>

        <p>Hi Venkat, have made a note to see the solar cooker. It looks like TTD is doing better than government run temples. Although in my opinion they can domore - run more free buses/transportation atleast for elderly and those with children, more creative ideas for darshan than just money money and moremoney.</p>
<p>Regarding government interference really there is nothing that does well under government control and temples are not any different. I don't know muchabout mosques and how they are management. I do know a lot about churches - there are lot of factors to church management that are very very different than temples. The concept of church itself for christians it is a community center, a place where friends/like minded people meet, discuss personal issues, take advice, all of that. A temple can perhaps do this but normallyit is not. Most chrsitians contribute regularly to the church they are afflliated with. Many churches depending on their affiliation get funds from abroad on a regular basis(many don't also but just much more than temples). Some churches are housed in antique buildings but many do not have significant art work or anything to be preserved. Lastly the christian community isusually very possessive as far as management goes, unlike us where nobody will come forward to do the dirty management work (unless money is involved) there is no shortage of people among them who are willing to do it. Givenall these factors government management might seem a remote possibility.</p>
<p>If we want to government to get out of our temples, first of all let us question how many among us are really willing to take on the administrative work. My parents managed a very small temple once, it is not a joke at all and very very significant amount of work is required which is often times thankless and demanding.</p>

        <p>Thank you Venkat, would be very interesting to hear more. The thought of Tirupathi as related to this came to my mind because Tirupathi is the richesttemple in the world. The fundamental fact of temple revenue is to make darshan easy/accessible/affordable for devotees, it is anything but that. TTD ca very easily provide free places to stay, free food and even travel from Tirumala. None of those conveniences are even considered. </p>
<p>Temples that cannot make ends meet are very different from Tirupathi as faras fund management goes I think. Some churches esp in US are managed exceptionally well, we can learn some in this regard. There is an undeniable marketing aspect involved on the other hand the church remains open and accessible to as many people as possible (of course there is no concept of deity and darshan in churches).</p>

<p>  Hi maloo<br />  you question would need to be answered with the context of history, politics and economics.</p>
<p>  first history<br />  the temples were probably owned by the kings who vanished with the adventof british. those who went along with them still retain the temples like sivaganga, ramnad and pudukottai.</p>
<p>   the next are well established adheenams which own temples for several centuries. the british were good enough not to disturb them.<br />  some large temples like vaitheeswaran koil, thirukadayur, thirunallar areowned by adheenams.</p>
<p>  these adheenams have a free hand to spend the money they receive I guess.they run colleges and choultries too.<br />  a majority of temples however had no owners since the kings vanished.<br />  example kapali temple, or thiruvallikeni for that matter.<br />  so the government owns them for some centuries.</p>
<p>  the tamilnadu temples own huge amounts of land. these lands are held by both poor peasants as well as powerful land sharks. its a huge political desicion which is required to get them back.needs a lot of back bone. <br />  people are very angry that the HR&amp;CE is literally looting the temples<br />  however i feel inspite of the governmental control and to an extent looting of the income,<br />  1.there is a degree of security for these temples, (people sometimes respect the government more than god- that arasan andre kolluvaan thievam nindru kollum example)</p>
<p>  2lesser bickering for their ownerships between locals.( this would have led to large scale violence and feuds- a small example is kandadevi temple which flares up every year)<br />  i am sure many including sathish kumar arunachalam will not agree . lets see the others viewpoint too now.</p>

<p>      TIRUMALA: The global meltdown has rocked the economies of several countries, toppling business establishments and pushing leading financial institutions to the verge of collapse . But the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams,the sole custodian of the Venkateswara temple, remains `unscathed.' The lion's share of the income of the TTD is derived from the hundi, in which devotees deposit their offerings. Over Rs.521 crore is expected from the hundiduring 2009-10 out of the total revenue of Rs.1,363 crore. The hundi contributes slightly above 38 % of the net proceeds of the TTD. Besides, going by TTD records the hundi income has registered a steady increase of 10-15 % every year over the past four decades. The hundi income from January 2009 to March 9 is put as Rs.40.69 crore, Rs.34.87 crore and Rs.40.90 crore as against Rs.36.13 crore, Rs.33.76 crore and Rs.37.76 crore for the corresponding period during 2008.</p>

<p>Todays Hindu papernews ( what timing!!)</p>
<p>Tirumala hundi untouched by the meltdown </p>
<p><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2009/04/15/stories/2009041557332000.htm" title="http://www.hindu.com/2009/04/15/stories/2009041557332000.htm">http://www.hindu.com/2009/04/15/stories/2009041557332000.htm</a></p>
<p>TIRUMALA: The global meltdown has rocked the economies of several countries, toppling business establishments and pushing leading financial institutions to the verge of collapse . But the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, the sole custodian of the Venkateswara temple, remains `unscathed.' The lion's share of the income of the TTD is derived from the hundi, in which devotees deposit their offerings. Over Rs.521 crore is expected from the hundi during 2009-10 out of the total revenue of Rs.1,363 crore. The hundi contributesslightly above 38 % of the net proceeds of the TTD. Besides, going by TTD records the hundi income has registered a steady increase of 10-15 % every year over the past four decades. The hundi income from January 2009 to March 9 is put as Rs.40.69 crore, Rs.34.87 crore and Rs.40.90 crore as against Rs.36.13 crore, Rs.33.76 crore and Rs.37.76 crore for the corresponding period during 2008.</p>
