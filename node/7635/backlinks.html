<p>  Making it a classical language has done it proud there are sceptics <br />  who say thats not fair but till today we did not even have it.....</p>

<p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>Your Tamizh Teacher was marvellous.. </p>
<p>I was taught by Dr. Sathiyaseelan in Trichy National. We stay in touch evennow.</p>
<p>I am sure you would have read Dr.Kalaikkovan's article on Rajaraja<br />in <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com" title="www.varalaaru.com">www.varalaaru.com</a>. Excellent choice of words and expressions in<br />Tamizh. In TN most of the parents take pride in exhibiting the<br />fluency of their children in English. Some move further and take<br />pride in proclaiming they do not speak or understand Tamil! If a<br />Tamil family spends about a decade in North / East, Hindi or Bengali<br />is the spoken language at home!</p>
<p>I recall your earlier mails that you are teaching Culture &amp; History in Tamil to your kids in England. Whenever I travel with<br />the family, I tell them more about Sangams, Thevaram, Prabandams,<br />Cholas etc.</p>

<p>Azhwar Thirunagari .. what a wonderful Divyadesam !</p>
<p>In my college (Trichy National) Tamilzh language was taught to me by<br />Dr. Sathiyaseelan and also by one Lakshminarayanan ..<br />"Sethadhin vayitril siriyathu pirandhal yethai thindru yenge<br />kidakkum ?" " Athai thindru ange kidakkum!"<br />.. Unforgettable teachings of my Teachers and the Masters!<br />Nammalwar - Madhurakavi - Periyavachan (vyakkgnan) pillai .. what a<br />combination !</p>
<p>Friends, it is believed that when all the other Azhwars visited the<br />Divyadesams to worship, the Deity from Each Divyadesam paraded<br />infront of Nammazhwar - to be hymned by Him !</p>

        <p>Ravi; I dont think Malathi compared Helen and Sita/Draupadi. She just pointed out<br />that countries/cities wre destroyed because of the actions of individuals.<br />The whole city/country was made to pay for actions of one of thier citizens.<br />Im sure its the same with Sita,Draupadi or Helen.</p>

Give us our tools and let our individual temperament flourish. Let tamizh be a dyanamic language with a cocktail of colourful dialects which can exist along with the pristine ancient form nurtured by high scholarship.</p>

<p>        I was taught by Dr. Sathiyaseelan in Trichy National. We stay in touch even now.</p>
<p>        I am sure you would have read Dr.Kalaikkovan' s article on Rajaraja</p>

<p>        Tamizh. In TN most of the parents take pride in exhibiting the</p>
<p>        fluency of their children in English. Some move further and take</p>
<p>        pride in proclaiming they do not speak or understand Tamil! If a</p>
<p>        Tamil family spends about a decade in North / East, Hindi or Bengali</p>
<p>        is the spoken language at home!</p>
<p>        I recall your earlier mails that you are teaching Culture &amp;         <br />        History in Tamil to your kids in England. Whenever I travel with</p>
<p>        the family, I tell them more about Sangams, Thevaram, Prabandams,</p>

And for the last time, stop teaching us "Isai Tamizh" and its glories by rote and teach us the Isai in tamizh. Teach us how to critically appraise it. Don't push opinions down our throat. Give us our tools and letour individual temperament flourish. Let tamizh be a dyanamic language with a cocktail of colourful dialects which can exist along with the pristine ancient form nurtured by high scholarship.</p>

<blockquote><p>    So Kannagi burnt Madurai because her husband was killed by a human, error-prone king? Burning a city is called genocide. And no woman's honour canjustify destroying a city. All right we get the message, Tamil people are chaste, but stop glorifying the city burning part. </p></blockquote>
<p>forget the literature part. it may be a over glorification<br />hasnt it happened really<br />the germans suffered untold miseries just because they tolerated the nazis and hitler.<br />the japenese suffered great anhiliation as a consequence of the their reckless leaders.<br />so somehow people are responsible for the actions of leaders they elect/ tolerate.</p>
<p>havent we all suffered because of the bad leaders we may have voted for.</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>    And i read plenty of tamil books where a lady kills herself because herhonour is taken by force. How can i justify it? The lady was honourable, she lived by the rules of the society, and she ought to be preserved by the society. Some rogue, taking advantage of the society's lack of vigilance, does an evil thing. By what scale will you justify the victim's death? </p>
<p>    The great tamil refrain: Maanam ponaal uyir vida vendum. But Ruyard Kipling says If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same; If you can fall and be pushed down to the earth and yet comeback, you are a man. Is life so cheap or you soul so noble that it must perish when it makes a human mistake? Isn't? fighting back against impossible odds the greatest thing to do? And accept defeat, retreat and comeback stronger a mark of a selfless leader? For if he fights to ''veera maranam' it means his clan will have to suffer slavery until a new leader arises. The story of Robert Bruce? The moral of the spider and the web? That is the example to follow, atleast in this age.</p>
<p>    Times are changing and tamil must change too. it must retain good things, reject snobbery, import good things from other languages and so on. And interpret its literature in view of changing times. A static language is a dead language.</p>
<p>    Tamil is being studied by foreign scholars. Will they be called traitors by their people? So if i happen to use english will i become a 'bad' tamizhan? I know my country, my history and i'm aware it has its own strengths and weaknesses. If i want to preserve my language, i'd accept it has faultsand emphasise the good things. </p>
<p>    Tamil must stop being so pedantic and sensitive. There is place for diversity in it. There is no such thing as God's language, nature's language blah blah. And for the last time, stop teaching us "Isai Tamizh" and its glories by rote and teach us the Isai in tamizh. Teach us how to critically appraise it. Don't push opinions down our throat.

<p>  I had Three major Tamil Teachers and I was pathetic in Tamil...esp spellings. Though I scored 93 and 90 % respectively in 10 and 12th board.</p>
<p>  One of my all time favorite teacher was Mr.Varadharajan. Though we had a pet name for him(thats has stayed for 20 years now). He was very nice person who made us enjoy Tamil classes. he knew every one read from konar guide , so he would tell where all we need to make correction in Konar guide. He never complicated things kept it really simple. He would tell things like astory and in language we will understand. We never had notes or even notebook for his class, he let us enjoy the class and no stress at all. Simply all students loved him and till love him...</p>
<p>  Another person was Mrs. Vishalakshi she was very dedicated and gave notesand every other care students needed. But always the run away popular Tamil teacher was Mr.Vradharajan.</p>
<p>  Then I shifted from CBSE to Matric in DAV gopalapuram. We had Mrs.Shanta as out Tamil teacher. She is teacher par excellence , her record shows , atleast 5 state rankers(highest total with Tamil language) would have been her students(including one of my classmates).</p>
<p>  But till life ends none of students of Mr.Varadharajan would forget him...very very popular and fun loving person.</p>

<p>    So Kannagi burnt Madurai because her husband was killed by a human, error-prone king? Burning a city is called genocide. And no woman's honour can justify destroying a city. All right we get the message, Tamil people are chaste, but stop glorifying the city burning part. And isn't the booka bit biased towards men? Women are guardians of honour etc., What about men? Can they be loose? </p>
<p>  Sir,</p>
<p>  With all my dues respects, I accept all the moral fallacies and a male chauvinistic society of the old era. But that shouldn't keep one person away from the beautiful poetry of Silapadikaram. Kannagi's myth was never interesting to me as a school kid. But last year when I read the whole Silapadikaram Translation by Alain Danileou , I was bowled over the beautiful verses.. It impressed me even in the translation.</p>
<p>  I love the 'Masaru ponne valambari muthe...' poetry of Illango. </p>
<p>  Unfortunately for political reasons , Kannagi as heroine is glorified than the poetry of Illango. Same in case of any other major Tamil works ...andto a greater extent Tamil History.</p>
<p>  The urge to portray Tamil Literature older than Sanskrit has caused havocand falsity, which is also heavily politically motivated. some how in the last century Politics has interfered and influenced the perception of TamilLanguage. People in power want us to believe Tamil is classical and old , without making us realize the beauty and the reason scholars call it a classical language. We are spun around with falsification and myths that after point of time students find the ideas too old fashioned and desert the literature. </p>
<p>  People really don't need to know whether Thiruvalluvar was born before CEor after CE. The emphasis should be on what he wrote. But unfortunatley here in Tamil Nadu people in power want to stress Thiruvalluvar to be a man born before Christ than what he says. Kamban's poetry is sacrificed to paintRama a black face.</p>
<p>  People have to see Tamil as language and Tamil culture two different things associated with each other , rather than two things as a whole.</p>
<p>  When they read Silapadikaram they should learn to appreciate the languageand criticize the male dominated society.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately we Tamilians in common have a feeling that what ever old isreally good. Unless and until Tamil as language is seen as separate entity, the love for Tamil wont develop among the younger generation.</p>

<p>    There is a place for serious tamil scholarship. All i'm saying that as long as tamil remains elitist, it will become a niche language, inaccessible to the common man. Shakespeare and Homer survive side by side with sms-lingo. Why is tamil so sensitive? What makes it so special that it shouldn't be flexible? Everybody can't understand the subtelities of literature. </p>
<p>    And tamil teachers. They are so special, aren't they? They are so high up. They reach heights of the sky and stay there. Questioning your teacher is against culture, right? You gotta accept whatever he denounces from the pulpit. No different value systems, alternate point of view, fresh perspective and so on. Just know the poem by heart and quote it at wish and will toslam everybody into submission. Ever read Orwell's 1984?</p>

<p>    And i read plenty of tamil books where a lady kills herself because herhonour is taken by force. How can i justify it? The lady was honourable, she lived by the rules of the society, and she ought to be preserved by the society. Some rogue, taking advantage of the society's lack of vigilance, does an evil thing. By what scale will you justify the victim's death? </p>
<p>    The great tamil refrain: Maanam ponaal uyir vida vendum. But Ruyard Kipling says If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same; If you can fall and be pushed down to the earth and yet comeback, you are a man. Is life so cheap or you soul so noble that it must perish when it makes a human mistake? Isn't? fighting back against impossible odds the greatest thing to do? And accept defeat, retreat and comeback stronger a mark of a selfless leader? For if he fights to ''veera maranam' it means his clan will have to suffer slavery until a new leader arises.The story of Robert Bruce? The moral of the spider and the web? That is the example to follow, atleast in this age.</p>
<p>    Times are changing and tamil must change too. it must retain good things, reject snobbery, import good things from other languages and so on. And interpret its literature in view of changing times. A static language is a dead language.</p>
<p>    Tamil is being studied by foreign scholars. Will they be called traitors by their people? So if i happen to use english will i become a 'bad' tamizhan? I know my country, my history and i'm aware it has its own strengths and weaknesses. If i want to preserve my language, i'd accept it has faultsand emphasise the good things. </p>
<p>    Tamil must stop being so pedantic and sensitive. There is place for diversity in it. There is no such thing as God's language, nature's language blah blah. And for the last time, stop teaching us "Isai Tamizh" and its glories by rote and teach us the Isai in tamizh. Teach us how to critically appraise it. Don't push opinions down our throat. Give us our tools and let our individual temperament flourish. Let tamizh be a dyanamic language with a cocktail of colourful dialects which can exist along with the pristine ancient form nurtured by high scholarship.</p>

<p>  So Kannagi burnt Madurai because her husband was killed by a human, error-prone king? Burning a city is called genocide. And no woman's honour can justify destroying a city. All right we get the message, Tamil people are chaste, but stop glorifying the city burning part. And isn't the book a bit biased towards men? Women are guardians of? honour etc., What about men? Can they be loose? </p>
<p>  And i read plenty of tamil books where a lady kills herself because her honour is taken by force. How can i justify it? The lady was honourable, shelived by the rules of the society, and she ought to be preserved by the society. Some rogue, taking advantage of the society's lack of vigilance, does an evil thing. By what scale will you justify the victim's death? </p>
<p>  The great tamil refrain: Maanam ponaal uyir vida vendum. But Ruyard Kipling says If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same; If you can fall and be pushed down to the earth and yetcomeback, you are a man. Is life so cheap or you soul so noble that it must perish when it makes a human mistake? Isn't? fighting back against impossible odds the greatest thing to do? And accept defeat, retreat and comeback stronger a mark of a selfless leader? For if he fights to ''veera maranam' it means his clan will have to suffer slavery until a new leader arises.The story of Robert Bruce? The moral of the spider and the web? That is the example to follow, atleast in this age.</p>
<p>  Times are changing and tamil must change too. it must retain good things,reject snobbery, import good things from other languages and so on. And interpret its literature in view of changing times. A static language is a dead language.</p>
<p>  Tamil is being studied by foreign scholars. Will they be called traitors by their people? So if i happen to use english will i become a 'bad' tamizhan? I know my country, my history and i'm aware it has its own strengths and weaknesses. If i want to preserve my language, i'd accept it has faults and emphasise the good things. </p>
<p>  Tamil must stop being so pedantic and sensitive. There is place for diversity in it. There is no such thing as God's language, nature's language blah blah. And for the last time, stop teaching us "Isai Tamizh" and its glories by rote and teach us the Isai in tamizh. Teach us how to critically appraise it. Don't push opinions down our throat. Give us our tools and let ourindividual temperament flourish. Let tamizh be a dyanamic language with a cocktail of colourful dialects which can exist along with the pristine ancient form nurtured by high scholarship.</p>

<p>Sir,<br />With all my dues respects, I accept all the moral fallacies and a male chauvinistic society of the old era. But that shouldn't keep one person away from the beautiful poetry of Silapadikaram. Kannagi's myth was never interesting to me as a school kid. But last year when I read the whole Silapadikaram Translation by Alain Danileou , I was bowled over the beautiful verses. It impressed me even in the translation.<br />I love the 'Masaru ponne valambari muthe...' poetry of Illango. <br />Unfortunately for political reasons , Kannagi as heroine is glorified than the poetry of Illango. Same in case of any other major Tamil works ...and to a greater extent Tamil History.</p>
<p>The urge to portray Tamil Literature older than Sanskrit has caused havoc and falsity, which is also heavily politically motivated. some how in the last century Politics has interfered and influenced the perception of Tamil Language. People in power want us to believe Tamil is classical and old , without making us realize the beauty and the reason scholars call it a classical language. We are spun around with falsification and myths that after point of time students find the ideas too old fashioned and desert the literature. </p>
<p>People really don't need to know whether Thiruvalluvar was born before CE or after CE. The emphasis should be on what he wrote. But unfortunatley herein Tamil Nadu people in power want to stress Thiruvalluvar to be a man born before Christ than what he says. Kamban's poetry is sacrificed to paint Rama a black face.</p>
<p>People have to see Tamil as language and Tamil culture two different thingsassociated with each other , rather than two things as a whole.<br />When they read Silapadikaram they should learn to appreciate the language and criticize the male dominated society.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we Tamilians in common have a feeling that what ever old is really good. Unless and until Tamil as language is seen as separate entity, the love for Tamil wont develop among the younger generation.</p>

<p>  I had Three major Tamil Teachers and I was pathetic in Tamil...esp spellings. Though I scored 93 and 90 % respectively in 10 and 12th board.</p>
<p>  One of my all time favorite teacher was Mr.Varadharajan. Though we had a pet name for him(thats has stayed for 20 years now). He was very nice person who made us enjoy Tamil classes. he knew every one read from konar guide , so he would tell where all we need to make correction in Konar guide. He never complicated things kept it really simple. He would tell things like astory and in language we will understand. We never had notes or even notebook for his class, he let us enjoy the class and no stress at all. Simply all students loved him and till love him...</p>
<p>  Another person was Mrs. Vishalakshi she was very dedicated and gave notesand every other care students needed. But always the run away popular Tamil teacher was Mr.Vradharajan.</p>
<p>  Then I shifted from CBSE to Matric in DAV gopalapuram. We had Mrs.Shanta as out Tamil teacher. She is teacher par excellence , her record shows , atleast 5 state rankers(highest total with Tamil language) would have been her students(including one of my classmates).</p>
<p>  But till life ends none of students of Mr.Varadharajan would forget him...very very popular and fun loving person.</p>

<p>    There is a place for serious tamil scholarship. All i'm saying that as long as tamil remains elitist, it will become a niche language, inaccessible to the common man. Shakespeare and Homer survive side by side with sms-lingo. Why is tamil so sensitive? What makes it so special that it shouldn't be flexible? Everybody can't understand the subtelities of literature. </p>
<p>    And tamil teachers. They are so special, aren't they? They are so high up. They reach heights of the sky and stay there. Questioning your teacher is against culture, right? You gotta accept whatever he denounces from the pulpit. No different value systems, alternate point of view, fresh perspective and so on. Just know the poem by heart and quote it at wish and will toslam everybody into submission. Ever read Orwell's 1984?</p>
<p>    So Kannagi burnt Madurai because her husband was killed by a human, error-prone king? Burning a city is called genocide. And no woman's honour canjustify destroying a city. All right we get the message, Tamil people are chaste, but stop glorifying the city burning part. And isn't the book a bitbiased towards men? Women are guardians of? honour etc., What about men? Can they be loose? </p>
<p>    And i read plenty of tamil books where a lady kills herself because herhonour is taken by force. How can i justify it? The lady was honourable, she lived by the rules of the society, and she ought to be preserved by the society. Some rogue, taking advantage of the society's lack of vigilance, does an evil thing. By what scale will you justify the victim's death? </p>
<p>    The great tamil refrain: Maanam ponaal uyir vida vendum. But Ruyard Kipling says If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same; If you can fall and be pushed down to the earth and yet comeback, you are a man. Is life so cheap or you soul so noble that it must perish when it makes a human mistake? Isn't? fighting back against impossible odds the greatest thing to do? And accept defeat, retreat and comeback stronger a mark of a selfless leader? For if he fights to ''veera maranam' it means his clan will have to suffer slavery until a new leader arises.The story of Robert Bruce? The moral of the spider and the web? That is the example to follow, atleast in this age.</p>
<p>    Times are changing and tamil must change too. it must retain good things, reject snobbery, import good things from other languages and so on. And interpret its literature in view of changing times. A static language is a dead language.</p>
<p>    Tamil is being studied by foreign scholars. Will they be called traitors by their people? So if i happen to use english will i become a 'bad' tamizhan? I know my country, my history and i'm aware it has its own strengths and weaknesses. If i want to preserve my language, i'd accept it has faultsand emphasise the good things. </p>
<p>    Tamil must stop being so pedantic and sensitive. There is place for diversity in it. There is no such thing as God's language, nature's language blah blah. And for the last time, stop teaching us "Isai Tamizh" and its glories by rote and teach us the Isai in tamizh. Teach us how to critically appraise it. Don't push opinions down our throat. Give us our tools and let our individual temperament flourish. Let tamizh be a dyanamic language with a cocktail of colourful dialects which can exist along with the pristine ancient form nurtured by high scholarship.</p>

<p>So u too from DAV Gopalapuram..Which batch?

As you said, the ND subjects were mostly abt society being biased towards the rich..Sevvalai, Aamai samugamum oomai muyalgalum,? and the ones referred by you. Nothing that will entice the reader.</p>

<p>  Your Tamizh Teacher was marvellous.. </p>
<p>  I was taught by Dr. Sathiyaseelan in Trichy National. We stay in touch even now.</p>
<p>  I am sure you would have read Dr.Kalaikkovan' s article on Rajaraja</p>

<p>  Tamizh. In TN most of the parents take pride in exhibiting the</p>
<p>  fluency of their children in English. Some move further and take</p>
<p>  pride in proclaiming they do not speak or understand Tamil! If a</p>
<p>  Tamil family spends about a decade in North / East, Hindi or Bengali</p>
<p>  is the spoken language at home!</p>
<p>  I recall your earlier mails that you are teaching Culture &amp;</p>
<p>  History in Tamil to your kids in England. Whenever I travel with</p>
<p>  the family, I tell them more about Sangams, Thevaram, Prabandams,</p>
<p>  Cholas etc.</p>

<blockquote><p>  And i read plenty of tamil books where a lady kills herself because her honour is taken by force. How can i justify it?&lt;<&lt; Please don't...it is from people like you that society and attitudes have to change. If you want to understand or explain it to younger people - you can - tell them that it was a different time and age when treatment of womenwas poor to say the least. And don't let it get in the way of appreciatingliterature, poetry and the passion you see there. Passion is not related to appreciating the same sentiment -Kannagi's fiery passion can be still appreciated as a rightful anger against injustice, regardless of what you think of chastity and burning cities in return.</p></&lt;></p></blockquote>
<p>Small appeal - change always begins at home. Talk to friends/family people you know, have the courage to face what they think and talk them out it. The great Mahakavi wrote of 'karpai podhuvil vaippom', way back in 1930s and 40s. Kalki wrote about a woman voluntarily separating from an abusive husband and bailing him out in court - this was in 1950s and he was from an orthodox brahmin background. May it be an inspiration for us all.</p>

<blockquote><p>  There is a place for serious tamil scholarship. All i'm saying that as long as tamil remains elitist, it will become a niche language, inaccessible to the common man. Shakespeare and Homer survive side by side with sms-lingo. Why is tamil so sensitive? What makes it so special that it shouldn't beflexible? Everybody can't understand the subtelities of literature. </p>
<p>  And tamil teachers. They are so special, aren't they? They are so high up. They reach heights of the sky and stay there. Questioning your teacher isagainst culture, right? You gotta accept whatever he denounces from the pulpit. No different value systems, alternate point of view, fresh perspective and so on. Just know the poem by heart and quote it at wish and will to slam everybody into submission. Ever read Orwell's 1984?</p>
<p>  So Kannagi burnt Madurai because her husband was killed by a human, error-prone king? Burning a city is called genocide. And no woman's honour can justify destroying a city. All right we get the message, Tamil people are chaste, but stop glorifying the city burning part. And isn't the book a bit biased towards men? Women are guardians of? honour etc., What about men? Can they be loose? </p>
<p>  And i read plenty of tamil books where a lady kills herself because her honour is taken by force. How can i justify it? The lady was honourable, shelived by the rules of the society, and she ought to be preserved by the society. Some rogue, taking advantage of the society's lack of vigilance, does an evil thing. By what scale will you justify the victim's death? </p>
<p>  The great tamil refrain: Maanam ponaal uyir vida vendum. But Ruyard Kipling says If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same; If you can fall and be pushed down to the earth and yetcomeback, you are a man. Is life so cheap or you soul so noble that it must perish when it makes a human mistake? Isn't? fighting back against impossible odds the greatest thing to do? And accept defeat, retreat and comeback stronger a mark of a selfless leader? For if he fights to ''veera maranam' it means his clan will have to suffer slavery until a new leader arises.The story of Robert Bruce? The moral of the spider and the web? That is the example to follow, atleast in this age.</p>
<p>  Times are changing and tamil must change too. it must retain good things,reject snobbery, import good things from other languages and so on. And interpret its literature in view of changing times. A static language is a dead language.</p>
<p>  Tamil is being studied by foreign scholars. Will they be called traitors by their people? So if i happen to use english will i become a 'bad' tamizhan? I know my country, my history and i'm aware it has its own strengths and weaknesses. If i want to preserve my language, i'd accept it has faults and emphasise the good things. </p>
<p>  Tamil must stop being so pedantic and sensitive. There is place for diversity in it. There is no such thing as God's language, nature's language blah blah. And for the last time, stop teaching us "Isai Tamizh" and its glories by rote and teach us the Isai in tamizh. Teach us how to critically appraise it. Don't push opinions down our throat. Give us our tools and let ourindividual temperament flourish. Let tamizh be a dyanamic language with a cocktail of colourful dialects which can exist along with the pristine ancient form nurtured by high scholarship.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>I had Three major Tamil Teachers and I was pathetic in Tamil...esp spellings. Though I scored 93 and 90 % respectively in 10 and 12th board.<br />One of my all time favorite teacher was Mr.Varadharajan. Though we had a pet name for him(thats has stayed for 20 years now). He was very nice person who made us enjoy Tamil classes. he knew every one read from konar guide , so he would tell where all we need to make correction in Konar guide. He never complicated things kept it really simple. He would tell things like a story and in language we will understand. We never had notes or even notebook for his class, he let us enjoy the class and no stress at all. Simply allstudents loved him and till love him...<br />Another person was Mrs. Vishalakshi she was very dedicated and gave notes and every other care students needed. But always the run away popular Tamil teacher was Mr.Vradharajan.</p>
<p>Then I shifted from <acronym title="Central Board of Secondary Education" CBSE</acronym  to Matric in DAV gopalapuram. We had Mrs.Shanta asout Tamil teacher. She is teacher par excellence , her record shows , at least 5 state rankers(highest total with Tamil language) would have been herstudents(including one of my classmates).</p>
<p>But till life ends none of students of Mr.Varadharajan would forget him...very very popular and fun loving person.</p>

<p>  Dear Sri,</p>
<p>  Your Tamizh Teacher was marvellous.. </p>
<p>  I was taught by Dr. Sathiyaseelan in Trichy National. We stay in touch even now.</p>
<p>  I am sure you would have read Dr.Kalaikkovan's article on Rajaraja<br />  in <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com" title="www.varalaaru.com">www.varalaaru.com</a>. Excellent choice of words and expressions in<br />  Tamizh. In TN most of the parents take pride in exhibiting the<br />  fluency of their children in English. Some move further and take<br />  pride in proclaiming they do not speak or understand Tamil! If a<br />  Tamil family spends about a decade in North / East, Hindi or Bengali<br />  is the spoken language at home!</p>
<p>  I recall your earlier mails that you are teaching Culture &amp;   History in Tamil to your kids in England. Whenever I travel with<br />  the family, I tell them more about Sangams, Thevaram, Prabandams,<br />  Cholas etc.</p>

          Our Tamil Teacher !!        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>There is a place for serious tamil scholarship. All i'm saying that as longas tamil remains elitist, it will become a niche language, inaccessible tothe common man. Shakespeare and Homer survive side by side with sms-lingo.Why is tamil so sensitive? What makes it so special that it shouldn't be flexible? Everybody can't understand the subtelities of literature. </p>
<p>And tamil teachers. They are so special, aren't they? They are so high up. They reach heights of the sky and stay there. Questioning your teacher is against culture, right? You gotta accept whatever he denounces from the pulpit. No different value systems, alternate point of view, fresh perspective and so on. Just know the poem by heart and quote it at wish and will to slam everybody into submission. Ever read Orwell's 1984?</p>
<p>So Kannagi burnt Madurai because her husband was killed by a human, error-prone king? Burning a city is called genocide. And no woman's honour can justify destroying a city. All right we get the message, Tamil people are chaste, but stop glorifying the city burning part. And isn't the book a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  biased towards men? Women are guardians of? honour etc., What about men? Canthey be loose? </p>
<p>And i read plenty of tamil books where a lady kills herself because her honour is taken by force. How can i justify it? The lady was honourable, she lived by the rules of the society, and she ought to be preserved by the society. Some rogue, taking advantage of the society's lack of vigilance, does an evil thing. By what scale will you justify the victim's death? </p>
<p>The great tamil refrain: Maanam ponaal uyir vida vendum. But Ruyard Kiplingsays If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same; If you can fall and be pushed down to the earth and yet comeback, you are a man. Is life so cheap or you soul so noble that it must perish when it makes a human mistake? Isn't? fighting back against impossible odds the greatest thing to do? And accept defeat, retreat and comebackstronger a mark of a selfless leader? For if he fights to ''veera maranam'it means his clan will have to suffer slavery until a new leader arises. The story of Robert Bruce? The moral of the spider and the web? That is the example to follow, atleast in this age.</p>
<p>Times are changing and tamil must change too. it must retain good things, reject snobbery, import good things from other languages and so on. And interpret its literature in view of changing times. A static language is a deadlanguage.</p>
<p>Tamil is being studied by foreign scholars. Will they be called traitors bytheir people? So if i happen to use english will i become a 'bad' tamizhan? I know my country, my history and i'm aware it has its own strengths and weaknesses. If i want to preserve my language, i'd accept it has faults andemphasise the good things. </p>
<p>Tamil must stop being so pedantic and sensitive. There is place for diversity in it. There is no such thing as God's language, nature's language blah blah. And for the last time, stop teaching us "Isai Tamizh" and its gloriesby rote and teach us the Isai in tamizh. Teach us how to critically appraise it. Don't push opinions down our throat. Give us our tools and let our individual temperament flourish. Let tamizh be a dyanamic language with a cocktail of colourful dialects which can exist along with the pristine ancient form nurtured by high scholarship.</p>
