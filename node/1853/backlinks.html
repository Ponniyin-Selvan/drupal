</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>That was quite an interesting analysis! I never noticed the parallels <br />between the two literary works before.</p>
<p>I must first confess that I have not really read kambaramayanam <br />(except for the odd passage that we studied in high school). I have <br />only attempted reading Rajaji's version (also called chakravarthy <br />thirumagan..?) thrice.. [attempted because i somehow got stuck at the <br />46th chapter every time, titled kamba chithiram, ironically.. :)] So <br />I guess I don't really have an opinion on it yet.</p>
<p>In any case, I am not sure if Kalki really wanted to "hero-worship" <br />Arulmozhi. Though his initial build-up to the character does seem <br />like he intended to portray Arulmozhi as a larger-than-life <br />personality, he does not dwell very long in it. He soon shows the <br />more down-to-earth, human nature of the character. He does not <br />hesitate to depict him as just another man with his own share of <br />follies and insecurities.</p>
<p>I suppose there have been several discussion threads on the same vein <br />in this forum regarding kalki's characterisations. I do believe Kalki <br />excels in portraying the good as well as the not-so-good facets of <br />his characters. I feel that is what makes them all the more human and <br />believable. Each character is fleshed out well with several shades of <br />goodness and badness (if there is such a word :P). The only other <br />author whom i know does that is Jane Austen. She produces the same <br />kind of multi-layered, nuanced characters whom you grow to love, as <br />much for their quirkiness as for their greatness. :)</p>
<p>So, I do not think they are really comparable on the "hero-worship" <br />front. What say? :)</p>
<p>A <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  about myself.. I am Ranjitha and I have been a lurker on this <br />group for almost year now. I guess I joined sometime in Jan in the <br />aftermath of my first reading of ponniyin selvan.. :) It really feels <br />amazing to be part of such a knowledgeable crowd.</acronym></p>
<p>Keep up the good work! :)</p>
<p>Take care<br />Ranjitha</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi members.I am sampath,a new member to this group.First thing I <br />did <br />  after joining was to read all the previous mails and I am <br />fascinated <br />  by the amount of knowledge this group members possess.</p>
<p>  In my first post I would give my views on what made PS great.I have <br />  read many epics in English and Tamil and in my opinion Ponniyin <br />  selvan can sit at par with any epic in any language in the <br />world.The <br />  closest competition to Ponniyin selvan will come from another tamil <br />  epic kambaramayanam.</p>
<p>  I have read most of shakespheres works and have always wondered <br />what <br />  made them great.Most of them were ordinary movie stories,for <br />example <br />  Romeo and juliet was nothing but a love story.Plain ordinary love <br />  story.What made it great?</p>
<p>  Its only the way in which the story was presented made it great.The <br />  words and the play writing skills of shakesphere made it an epic.If <br />  I can use a parallel from cinema,its not the story that makes a <br />  movie succesful.Its the screenplay that makes the movie <br />succesful.We <br />  have seen great writers transforming ordinary stories into great <br />  epics by just presenting it in a beautiful way.</p>
<p>  Similiarly Kalki has made this ordinary fight for asendency to <br />  throne between 3 heirs a mega epic by presenting it in a beautiful <br />  way.But the only pity is that it can be understood only by people <br />  who know Tamil.Even if we translate it into English the charm goes <br />  away.If we picturize it also the charm goes away.</p>
<p>  Another aspect I love in Ponniyin Selvan is characterization.The <br />way <br />  Kalki has created each characters has been magnificient.But in this <br />  aspect I would place him a bit lower than Kambar(Sorry hardcore <br />  Kalki fans,but I'm sure Kalki will agree with me.If we say he is <br />  next to kambar he will feel proud)</p>
<p>  The reason I say is as follows.I would like to compare both on <br />  characterization.Kalki's creation of characters like Vandiya <br />thevan, <br />  Ponniyin selvan,manimekalai was great.Even though he worshipped <br />  arulmozhi in the novel it did not look artificial.Tamils have <br />  worshipped MGR and know what hero worship is.Kalki also made the <br />  Hero worship worthwhile.He made us believe that Arulmozhi deserved <br />  the hero worship he had.</p>
<p>  Kambar also had limits and he also had to hero worship.<br />  But within this limits what a beautiful job he performed?What a <br />  characterization he created for everyone?For example when Rama shot <br />  vali hiding behind a tree valmigi writes as if vali abused Rama and <br />  in that scence made rama appear as a villian and vali as a hero.But <br />  kambar changes that.</p>
<p>  Vali calls rama as "Why did you shoot me from behind?Kathir <br />mathiyam <br />  pol mugathoye.."--Is this abuse?Even when Vali is down in earth he <br />  couldnt stop admiring rama,who killed him.So kambar hails rama in <br />  valis words.Will anybody hail his killer as "kathir mathiyam pol <br />  mugathoye.."(Im not sure about exact wordings here,im sorry)</p>
<p>  In every abuse of vali Kambar adds a praise for Rama.There he <br />  glorofies Rama better than even valmigi.</p>
<p>  And Valmigi wrote as ravana lifted seetha by his hands.But Kambar <br />  couldnt tolerate the thought that anyone can even touch seeta.So <br />he <br />  wrote as "Ravana lifted the hut along with the land and carried <br />  seetha without touching her".He upholds tamil culture there.</p>
<p>  The way he has characterized Bharatha makes us wonder whether Rama <br />  is the hero of the epic or bharatha is.See the way in which he <br />  builds the Bharatha character.</p>
<p>  When Dasaratha tells Rama that Bharatha will be the king,Rama goes <br />  and tells his mother kousalya that bharatha will be the new <br />king.See <br />  what words Kambar puts in kousalyas mouth.</p>
<p>  "Bharatha is three times better than you to rule this kingdom".</p>
<p>  See this.Even after hearing that her only son is being robbed of <br />his <br />  throne the words that come from kousalyas mouth are hailing <br />  bharatha.See further how Kambar builds bharathas character.</p>
<p>  When Bharatha goes to forest to meet ram he meets Guha.After <br />hearing <br />  why Bharatha has come to the forest Guha is fascinated.He hugs <br />  Bharatha,cries and says "Even thousand Rama's are not equal to you".</p>
<p>  See this.Now Bharatha is hailed as 1000 times better than Rama,the <br />  hero of the epic.But the climax is the pinching one.</p>
<p>  When Rama doesnt return after 14 years Bharatha is about to jump <br />  into fire.Then kousalya prevents him and says "Dont do it my son.I <br />  can live without Rama but not without you.PALAKODI ramnum unakku <br />  iniyavano?"</p>
<p>  Here Bharatha is portrayed as better than "Palakodi Raman",the hero <br />  of the epic.This is how Kambar built each character with the <br />limited <br />  freedom he had.</p></blockquote>

          Kambar Vs Kalki - another take        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p></p>
<blockquote><p> Dear Sampath</p></blockquote>
<p>Kalki too must have fallen into the trap.He lifted arulmozhi very <br />high initially but i dont see him dropping arulmozhi down <br />anywhere.Arulmozhi is not shown with ordinary human weaknesses.He <br />never loses a sword fight,he shows the right emotions at the right <br />time,his aura is maintained till the end.He doesnt want to sit in <br />throne till the fag end and even that decision is taken only since <br />he wanted to free vanthiyathevan.</p>
<p>I dont remember arulmozhi doing any "mistakes" in PS.Maybe in last <br />parts he shows a more down to earth arulmozhi,but still srulmozhi <br />is elevated above other mortals.</p>
<blockquote><p>      One of the greatest feats of Kalki is his charectors are with <br />faults...Most happening in life will not occur if we all were </p></blockquote>
<p>faultless...</p>
<p>All the other authors have hero worship but not kalki...</p>
<p>Ilanchezhian outwits Tiberious ,Ili Yazu,Yavana maruthuvan, Kadal <br />Kollaiyar and Irungovel et al ....thats hero worship..</p>
<p>Ilaya pallavan and Anabayan escape from kalingam in a daring <br />attempt...Ilayapallavan outwis beeman,balavarman and jeya varman and <br />all the other bad elements thats hero worship....</p>
<p>Let me remind you Vandiyadevan is as much a hero of the story as <br />Arulmozhi Kaki himself says so...He losses in fights,he gets trapped <br />in many occasions,he ends up in the prison etc etc....</p>
<p>Arulmozhi himself accepts he declines the lankan throne due to pre <br />arranged politics....He gets angry and irritated when people get <br />smart like in irandam paagam...he dreams of alaikadalum <br />oynthirukka....</p>
<p>he argues why a odakara penn may be as good as vanathi...</p>
<p>he accepts he understood his sister sending him to Lanka</p>
<p>he falls victim to Malaria..</p>
<p>He gets rescued by women time and time again....Ponni <br />amman...mandakini...poonguzhali....If Kalki wanted to make Arulmozhi <br />a in fallible hero he would have created a ship fight to rescue <br />Vandiya devan...<br />Or atleast made him swim with his freind all the way to the shore...</p>
<p>He states that he doesnt want to become King and chages his mind yes <br />of course to save his freind but...he does act like normal human <br />beings...</p>
<p>He does not get hero worshiped.....</p>
<p>Coming to Sivakamiyin sabatham Mahendra pallava is defeated <br />Narasimha pallava changes mood so often....</p>
<p>Kalki doesnt hero worship his charectors</p>
<p>I rest my case</p>
<p>Sri</p>

<p>    That was quite an interesting analysis! I never noticed the <br />  parallels <br />    between the two literary works before.</p>
<p>    I must first confess that I have not really read kambaramayanam <br />    (except for the odd passage that we studied in high school). I <br />  have <br />    only attempted reading Rajaji's version (also called chakravarthy <br />    thirumagan..?) thrice.. [attempted because i somehow got stuck at <br />  the <br />    46th chapter every time, titled kamba chithiram, ironically.. :)] <br />  So <br />    I guess I don't really have an opinion on it yet.</p>
<p>    In any case, I am not sure if Kalki really wanted to "hero-<br />  worship" <br />    Arulmozhi. Though his initial build-up to the character does seem <br />    like he intended to portray Arulmozhi as a larger-than-life <br />    personality, he does not dwell very long in it. He soon shows the <br />    more down-to-earth, human nature of the character. He does not <br />    hesitate to depict him as just another man with his own share of <br />    follies and insecurities.</p>
<p>    I suppose there have been several discussion threads on the same <br />  vein <br />    in this forum regarding kalki's characterisations. I do believe <br />  Kalki <br />    excels in portraying the good as well as the not-so-good facets <br />of <br />    his characters. I feel that is what makes them all the more human <br />  and <br />    believable. Each character is fleshed out well with several <br />shades <br />  of <br />    goodness and badness (if there is such a word :P). The only other <br />    author whom i know does that is Jane Austen. She produces the <br />same <br />    kind of multi-layered, nuanced characters whom you grow to love, <br />  as <br />    much for their quirkiness as for their greatness. :)</p>
<p>    So, I do not think they are really comparable on the "hero-<br />  worship" <br />    front. What say? :)</p>
<p>    A bit about myself.. I am Ranjitha and I have been a lurker on <br />  this <br />    group for almost year now. I guess I joined sometime in Jan in <br />the <br />    aftermath of my first reading of ponniyin selvan.. :) It really <br />  feels <br />    amazing to be part of such a knowledgeable crowd.</p>
<p>    Keep up the good work! :)</p>
<p>    Take care<br />    Ranjitha</p>

<p>      Hi members.I am sampath,a new member to this group.First thing <br />I <br />    did <br />      after joining was to read all the previous mails and I am <br />    fascinated <br />      by the amount of knowledge this group members possess.</p>
<p>      In my first post I would give my views on what made PS great.I <br />  have <br />      read many epics in English and Tamil and in my opinion Ponniyin <br />      selvan can sit at par with any epic in any language in the <br />    world.The <br />      closest competition to Ponniyin selvan will come from another <br />  tamil <br />      epic kambaramayanam.</p>
<p>      I have read most of shakespheres works and have always wondered <br />    what <br />      made them great.Most of them were ordinary movie stories,for <br />    example <br />      Romeo and juliet was nothing but a love story.Plain ordinary <br />  love <br />      story.What made it great?</p>
<p>      Its only the way in which the story was presented made it <br />  great.The <br />      words and the play writing skills of shakesphere made it an <br />  epic.If <br />      I can use a parallel from cinema,its not the story that makes a <br />      movie succesful.Its the screenplay that makes the movie <br />    succesful.We <br />      have seen great writers transforming ordinary stories into <br />great <br />      epics by just presenting it in a beautiful way.</p>
<p>      Similiarly Kalki has made this ordinary fight for asendency to <br />      throne between 3 heirs a mega epic by presenting it in a <br />  beautiful <br />      way.But the only pity is that it can be understood only by <br />  people <br />      who know Tamil.Even if we translate it into English the charm <br />  goes <br />      away.If we picturize it also the charm goes away.</p>
<p>      Another aspect I love in Ponniyin Selvan is <br />characterization.The <br />    way <br />      Kalki has created each characters has been magnificient.But in <br />  this <br />      aspect I would place him a bit lower than Kambar(Sorry hardcore <br />      Kalki fans,but I'm sure Kalki will agree with me.If we say he <br />is <br />      next to kambar he will feel proud)</p>
<p>      The reason I say is as follows.I would like to compare both on <br />      characterization.Kalki's creation of characters like Vandiya <br />    thevan, <br />      Ponniyin selvan,manimekalai was great.Even though he worshipped <br />      arulmozhi in the novel it did not look artificial.Tamils have <br />      worshipped MGR and know what hero worship is.Kalki also made <br />the <br />      Hero worship worthwhile.He made us believe that Arulmozhi <br />  deserved <br />      the hero worship he had.</p>
<p>      Kambar also had limits and he also had to hero worship.<br />      But within this limits what a beautiful job he performed?What a <br />      characterization he created for everyone?For example when Rama <br />  shot <br />      vali hiding behind a tree valmigi writes as if vali abused Rama <br />  and <br />      in that scence made rama appear as a villian and vali as a <br />  hero.But <br />      kambar changes that.</p>
<p>      Vali calls rama as "Why did you shoot me from behind?Kathir <br />    mathiyam <br />      pol mugathoye.."--Is this abuse?Even when Vali is down in earth <br />  he <br />      couldnt stop admiring rama,who killed him.So kambar hails rama <br />  in <br />      valis words.Will anybody hail his killer as "kathir mathiyam <br />pol <br />      mugathoye.."(Im not sure about exact wordings here,im sorry)</p>
<p>      In every abuse of vali Kambar adds a praise for Rama.There he <br />      glorofies Rama better than even valmigi.</p>
<p>      And Valmigi wrote as ravana lifted seetha by his hands.But <br />  Kambar <br />      couldnt tolerate the thought that anyone can even touch <br />  seeta.So <br />    he <br />      wrote as "Ravana lifted the hut along with the land and carried <br />      seetha without touching her".He upholds tamil culture there.</p>
<p>      The way he has characterized Bharatha makes us wonder whether <br />  Rama <br />      is the hero of the epic or bharatha is.See the way in which he <br />      builds the Bharatha character.</p>
<p>      When Dasaratha tells Rama that Bharatha will be the king,Rama <br />  goes <br />      and tells his mother kousalya that bharatha will be the new <br />    king.See <br />      what words Kambar puts in kousalyas mouth.</p>
<p>      "Bharatha is three times better than you to rule this kingdom".</p>
<p>      See this.Even after hearing that her only son is being robbed <br />of <br />    his <br />      throne the words that come from kousalyas mouth are hailing <br />      bharatha.See further how Kambar builds bharathas character.</p>
<p>      When Bharatha goes to forest to meet ram he meets Guha.After <br />    hearing <br />      why Bharatha has come to the forest Guha is fascinated.He hugs <br />      Bharatha,cries and says "Even thousand Rama's are not equal to <br />  you".</p>
<p>      See this.Now Bharatha is hailed as 1000 times better than <br />  Rama,the <br />      hero of the epic.But the climax is the pinching one.</p>
<p>      When Rama doesnt return after 14 years Bharatha is about to <br />jump <br />      into fire.Then kousalya prevents him and says "Dont do it my <br />  son.I <br />      can live without Rama but not without you.PALAKODI ramnum <br />unakku <br />      iniyavano?"</p>
<p>      Here Bharatha is portrayed as better than "Palakodi Raman",the <br />  hero <br />      of the epic.This is how Kambar built each character with the <br />    limited <br />      freedom he had.</p></rojatraders@y...></p></blockquote>

        <p>Dear Sampath</p>
<p>I feel that you are falling into a trap and not kalki. You seem to <br />suggest that Arulmozhi should necessarily have been brought down in <br />th eyes of the readers at some point in the novel. But why should <br />that be? Arulmozhi is not a fictitious character but Rajaraja <br />himself, arguably among the greatest rulers from India. He should <br />certainly have been a super human to have achieved what he did. Kalki <br />cannot invent or subvert history to satisfy your expectation. With <br />all these constraints Kalki has done a marvelous job of etching early <br /><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's character with a lot normal human frailities. </p>
<p>I would say your analysis here is a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  colored because of your <br />rather faulty expectations regarding characterisation. </acronym></p>

He soon shows the <br />  more down-to-earth, human nature of the character. He does not <br />  hesitate to depict him as just another man with his own share of <br />  follies and insecurities.</p>
<p>  I suppose there have been several discussion threads on the same <br />vein <br />  in this forum regarding kalki's characterisations. I do believe <br />Kalki <br />  excels in portraying the good as well as the not-so-good facets of <br />  his characters. I feel that is what makes them all the more human <br />and <br />  believable. Each character is fleshed out well with several shades <br />of <br />  goodness and badness (if there is such a word :P). The only other <br />  author whom i know does that is Jane Austen. She produces the same <br />  kind of multi-layered, nuanced characters whom you grow to love, <br />as <br />  much for their quirkiness as for their greatness. :)</p>
<p>  So, I do not think they are really comparable on the "hero-<br />worship" <br />  front. What say? :)</p>
<p>  A bit about myself.. I am Ranjitha and I have been a lurker on <br />this <br />  group for almost year now. I guess I joined sometime in Jan in the <br />  aftermath of my first reading of ponniyin selvan.. :) It really <br />feels <br />  amazing to be part of such a knowledgeable crowd.</p>
<p>  Keep up the good work! :)</p>
<p>  Take care<br />  Ranjitha</p>

<p>    Hi members.I am sampath,a new member to this group.First thing I <br />  did <br />    after joining was to read all the previous mails and I am <br />  fascinated <br />    by the amount of knowledge this group members possess.</p>
<p>    In my first post I would give my views on what made PS great.I <br />have <br />    read many epics in English and Tamil and in my opinion Ponniyin <br />    selvan can sit at par with any epic in any language in the <br />  world.The <br />    closest competition to Ponniyin selvan will come from another <br />tamil <br />    epic kambaramayanam.</p>
<p>    I have read most of shakespheres works and have always wondered <br />  what <br />    made them great.Most of them were ordinary movie stories,for <br />  example <br />    Romeo and juliet was nothing but a love story.Plain ordinary <br />love <br />    story.What made it great?</p>
<p>    Its only the way in which the story was presented made it <br />great.The <br />    words and the play writing skills of shakesphere made it an <br />epic.If <br />    I can use a parallel from cinema,its not the story that makes a <br />    movie succesful.Its the screenplay that makes the movie <br />  succesful.We <br />    have seen great writers transforming ordinary stories into great <br />    epics by just presenting it in a beautiful way.</p>
<p>    Similiarly Kalki has made this ordinary fight for asendency to <br />    throne between 3 heirs a mega epic by presenting it in a <br />beautiful <br />    way.But the only pity is that it can be understood only by <br />people <br />    who know Tamil.Even if we translate it into English the charm <br />goes <br />    away.If we picturize it also the charm goes away.</p>
<p>    Another aspect I love in Ponniyin Selvan is characterization.The <br />  way <br />    Kalki has created each characters has been magnificient.But in <br />this <br />    aspect I would place him a bit lower than Kambar(Sorry hardcore <br />    Kalki fans,but I'm sure Kalki will agree with me.If we say he is <br />    next to kambar he will feel proud)</p>
<p>    The reason I say is as follows.I would like to compare both on <br />    characterization.Kalki's creation of characters like Vandiya <br />  thevan, <br />    Ponniyin selvan,manimekalai was great.Even though he worshipped <br />    arulmozhi in the novel it did not look artificial.Tamils have <br />    worshipped MGR and know what hero worship is.Kalki also made the <br />    Hero worship worthwhile.He made us believe that Arulmozhi <br />deserved <br />    the hero worship he had.</p>
<p>    Kambar also had limits and he also had to hero worship.<br />    But within this limits what a beautiful job he performed?What a <br />    characterization he created for everyone?For example when Rama <br />shot <br />    vali hiding behind a tree valmigi writes as if vali abused Rama <br />and <br />    in that scence made rama appear as a villian and vali as a <br />hero.But <br />    kambar changes that.</p>
<p>    Vali calls rama as "Why did you shoot me from behind?Kathir <br />  mathiyam <br />    pol mugathoye.."--Is this abuse?Even when Vali is down in earth <br />he <br />    couldnt stop admiring rama,who killed him.So kambar hails rama <br />in <br />    valis words.Will anybody hail his killer as "kathir mathiyam pol <br />    mugathoye.."(Im not sure about exact wordings here,im sorry)</p>
<p>    In every abuse of vali Kambar adds a praise for Rama.There he <br />    glorofies Rama better than even valmigi.</p>
<p>    And Valmigi wrote as ravana lifted seetha by his hands.But <br />Kambar <br />    couldnt tolerate the thought that anyone can even touch <br />seeta.So <br />  he <br />    wrote as "Ravana lifted the hut along with the land and carried <br />    seetha without touching her".He upholds tamil culture there.</p>
<p>    The way he has characterized Bharatha makes us wonder whether <br />Rama <br />    is the hero of the epic or bharatha is.See the way in which he <br />    builds the Bharatha character.</p>
<p>    When Dasaratha tells Rama that Bharatha will be the king,Rama <br />goes <br />    and tells his mother kousalya that bharatha will be the new <br />  king.See <br />    what words Kambar puts in kousalyas mouth.</p>
<p>    "Bharatha is three times better than you to rule this kingdom".</p>
<p>    See this.Even after hearing that her only son is being robbed of <br />  his <br />    throne the words that come from kousalyas mouth are hailing <br />    bharatha.See further how Kambar builds bharathas character.</p>
<p>    When Bharatha goes to forest to meet ram he meets Guha.After <br />  hearing <br />    why Bharatha has come to the forest Guha is fascinated.He hugs <br />    Bharatha,cries and says "Even thousand Rama's are not equal to <br />you".</p>
<p>    See this.Now Bharatha is hailed as 1000 times better than <br />Rama,the <br />    hero of the epic.But the climax is the pinching one.</p>
<p>    When Rama doesnt return after 14 years Bharatha is about to jump <br />    into fire.Then kousalya prevents him and says "Dont do it my <br />son.I <br />    can live without Rama but not without you.PALAKODI ramnum unakku <br />    iniyavano?"</p>
<p>    Here Bharatha is portrayed as better than "Palakodi Raman",the <br />hero <br />    of the epic.This is how Kambar built each character with the <br />  limited <br />    freedom he had.</p></rojatraders@y...></p></blockquote>
