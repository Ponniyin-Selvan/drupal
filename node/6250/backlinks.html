        <p>Priya,</p>
<p>Success in career and success in personal life are two different things.<br />Career wise there are lot of sucessful men / women, whose personal life is<br />pathetic. So suscess in one field (Career) doesnt need sacrifice by the<br />partner in the other (Personal).</p>
<p>But if you want to strike a balance of good career and good personal life<br />then the sacrifice of the partner comes in picture. I am talking about<br />sucess in career alone. Now tell me what are we talking / discussing about.<br />Are we in the same page? If YES Then we will discuss.</p>

          Men&#039;s mind set about women&#039;s self-respect        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Atpu, very well said :))<br />?<br />Men and women being equal does not mean they are 'same' there are basic differences which will never be the same - the average man is usually strongerthan a woman, a woman can have children and has certain natural nurturing tendencies, women think from the 'heart' as someone said and men from the 'head'. These differences are exactly why there are differences in treatmentas you point out - it is courtesy to open doors, carry bags and such things to a woman, and if you see carefully usually many men *like* a woman to ask them for help with heavy luggage, let them drive the car, and so on. It has nothing to do with being liberal it is just simple good natured acts ofcourtesy to one another with gentle awareness of how we are different. <br />?<br />Female strength is moral courage not physical. It is conceptually not understood at all unfortunately in many parts of our country despite having so much of historical and religious background emphasizing it.<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>To share my thoughts, if I may..</p>
<p>Behind every successful person, there will be several people who would <br />have played important parts. Some will be men and others will be women. <br />However, if the successful person is a family man/woman, his/her other half <br />needs to be understanding, supportive and may have to sacrifice a lot. <br />Ideally, one should strength and motivation from the other.</p>
<p>If we look at any great achievers in public life, we will see they will not <br />have devoted that much time to their family. Usually, the achievers have <br />been men and therefore the saying 'Behind every sucessful man there is a <br />woman'. I don't think it refers to mentors. Men usually have another man as <br />mentor and women likewise. There are, of course, exceptions.</p>
<p>We just have to accept that men and women are designed differently <br />(physiologically as well as psychologically) for a purpose. If one ventures <br />into doing something that is traditionally the other's territory, there <br />will naturally be resistence. Therefore, it will be harder to do, initially.</p>
<p>In western society women have much less barriers to compete equally with <br />men. One thing I don't understand is, even here, there are still manners <br />like 'Ladies first', when it comes to getting in to car, lift, giving up <br />seat,offering wine, etc. This is something even the most liberal women <br />don't seem to mind! </p>
<p>That was my half penny worth. This goup is very rich indeed with every one <br />giving their 2 pence worth!</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Udanx, SPS sir has already gave you an explanation which made my job easier. I think you didn't get my point. In my last mail itself I told that 'there are some women and men who have succeeded by themselves (at least as far as we know that they are not dependent on anyone) like Mother Teresa and Abdul kalam'. </p>
<p>And also I told earlier that both men and women are dependent in one way or other in a society. </p>
<p>when you say that somebody influence your carreer's success, it doesn't strictly mean that they have to help you in your carreer. They should cooperate with you in such a way that you have enough time to concentrate in your carrer. Even the wives or husbands who donot know anything about your job could contribute to your success by looking after all the responsibilties at home, including your responsibilities. That may or may not come to light even in case of great successful person. </p>
<p>you have told that 'behind every bright man's failure in life / business there is definetly a woman's hand'!. So you yourself accept a woman has influence in man's failure. This implies that a woman has influence in man's life and so also in success. That of course applies for a woman. I just go by your words only.</p>
<p>Its my humble opinion that, nobody is trying to prove you wrong, we are just exchanging our views. Ofcourse opinion differs, that does mean somebody's wrong and somebody's right. Have no hard feelings, and be cool.</p>
<p>thanks and regards,<br />Priya</p>

<p>SPS,</p>
<p>Let your wife take a bow from me. I salute that lady who had been a visionary about real estates. But again the sample size is small from your end as well. Both the parties can keep on quoting examples which will keep this thread active for sometime. But I trust thats not the motive of this thread.</p>
<p>In one of my earlier mails in this thread I have accepted that given the freedom and suport women can shine in their fields and I quoted the case of ICICI Bank. I will go even a step ahead, with the support and freeodm woman out class / out smart men. But it is mandatory for ALL SUCESSFUL woman that she gets freedom and support.</p>
<p>Where as MOST OF THE SUCESSFUL MEN didnt need support from woman. This is my observation about the society. If I am proved wrong I am ready to eat my words. After all this group is for learning new things / sharing ideas and knowledge.</p>
<p>~ Udanx</p>
<p>Thats the end of my mail for woman folks</p>
<p>Guys,</p>
<p>It may be noted that behind every bright man's failure in life / business there is definetly a woman's hand!</p>
<p>~ Udanx</p>
<p>PS: I am that my inbox will be bombarded with feminist in our group for the previous line. Lunch @ Andra Mess and Curd rice in action ... Kanna Kattudhu ... So thought of writing a mail which will keep me awake for some time now! Velila Ore Mazha What to do?</p>

<p>  So i guess we can never generalize anything when it comes to human<br />nature.<br />  It depends so much on a person's upbringing, inidvidual characteristic.<br />  Havent we seen cases were when a single mother fights teh society to<br />bring<br />  up her children but fails miserably.. (may be due to various reasons<br />which<br />  she may not be solely responsible.)</p>
<p>  I do agree that a happy family is one where there's both mom and dad to<br />  shower their affection on kids along with grandparents to impart their<br />  wisdom.<br />  But ofcourse, we dont live in a perfect world!</p>
<p>  As for man backing a woman or vice-versa, I strongly believe it goes<br />hand in<br />  hand.<br />  Be whatever be their career, i guess all the responsibilities are to be<br />  shared by both in other to cope in a fast paced world where we need to<br />  juggle with career, child care, home needs etc.<br />  Times have changed now, with all the globalization, most of us into<br />the IT<br />  industry, are used to staying alone in foriegn countries. So there is no<br />  excuse for a guy or a gal for not participating in household<br />chores.. coz<br />  they've already done it before!<br />  So everything sums up to shredding off ego and share ur life with ur<br />  partner.</p>

        <p>Dear Shanthi, I was talking of the Kovai of my days(70s and 80s). Very gladto hear of the progress. It would be pertinent though to look at some statistics also - I have been to different parts of TN - Tiruchy, Madurai, Kovai,  for example. Comparatively speaking Kovai lifestyle was much more laid back and more prosperous, definitely.<br /> <br />In my class of 54 girls only 3 of us did post graduation. Out of that one stayed back in Kovai, one went to Delhi and I came to US. It was completely unthinkable among the rest to go out of Kovai. Even when I visited some beloved friends they are  astonished 'enna panareenga anga' .Also was pertinent that in those days atleast there were no bookshops or libraries in Kovai - other than those selling textbooks and tea stalls with tamil magazines. I was among the minority who used to go to railway station Higginbothams for buying books or frequent old newspaper shops to grab discarded copies. It is a true fact.<br /> <br />If things have improved am truly happy since it was the land I grew up in,<br /> <br />Malathi</p>

<p>Hi Malathi,<br />I am from coimbatore.I disagree on this part of your mail-girls of coimbatore see  movies, shop for saree , eat out and are thoroughly spoilt.please do come and see them now.There are women like Rajshree Pathy,Mrs.Nandhini Rangasamy,Dr. Asha Rao,Mrs .Rajini krishnamoorthy to name a few who are heading bussiness and educational institutions. Some youngsters in their late twenties are also managing schools very well.My friend whose  family is one of the top ten families in coimbatore is in charge of a multi specality hospital and she runs it so well.<br />Even here in coimbatore you can see young girls zooming in their two wheelers late in the night.<br />with regards,<br />shanthi</p>

<p>Dear Anandhi, yes I grew up in Kovai, unforgettable years for me too!! We lived in the RS Puram area. I went to school at St Josephs. Most of my friends lived the area between RS Puram and mid Kovai (Chintamani) . Talk of opulence and wealth, US suburbs look lower middle class compared to those mansions :)) <br /> <br />Kovai had its charms. People had money and were very laidback, quite unlikestress ridden Chennai :) Politeness was the norm, you could even ask a stranger for help. Auto people did not cheat. And it was safe (atleast in those days). My mom and me used to walk back after second show at night (since movies were the only time pass) with no fear of anyone or anything. I hear it is grossly overpopulated nowadays, and traffic/busyness has taken over, like anywhere else. <br /> <br />I am not surprised that your cousins had to be married off. If you live there a lot of conservative ideas sink in, slowly or surely. I have never everseen girls so spoilt as they are in Kovai - life was about movies, eating out, and sari shopping, that is all. If all our friends are like that what do we do, same ultimately.<br /> <br />Where did you live in Kovai? Would love to hear more. I beleive Shoba also said she is from there.<br /> <br />Malathi</p>

<p>Malathi, <br /> <br />  You are from Coimbatore!! Well my parents are from coimbatore, all my aunts, uncles, cousin live there. My aunts (father's sisters) are very conservative that they did not let my elder sister do her masters saying "Neraya padichirundha maapila thedarathu kashtam". After marriage, she completed her masters.<br /> <br />  I did my Masters from ADU, coimbatore. Unforgettable yearsin my life.<br /> <br />Anandhi</p>

<p>Arun, Coimbatore.. oh wow..I could write volumes..I grew up there...if you want to combine all the 'graamiya' movies made it would not take a candle to the conservativsm in Coimbatore as far as women go. When I went to schoolthere - after 8th grade it is not ok to wear anything other than pavada/dhavani. It is not ok to sit next to a man in the bus even if I am a seventh grader and he is older than my grandpa. It is absolutely not ok for women to work (my cousin who used to work in a bank regularly used to face abuse even from customers, indha pappara ponnunga veetula irukkama inge enna pannareenga) . Coimbatore is the heartland of conservative TN - very rich peopleand very old conservative attitudes. Over 80% of the girls in my class of 53 girls were engaged to be married by the time we reached 9th grade. This was in the late 80s, not that far back. There was also a fairly large population of rich north indians where girls did as they pleased, but if<br />you want to relate to the local tamil populace, forget it you have to embrace what they think.<br /> <br />Some of it might have changed now. A lot of it I don't believe will change very easily. It is very deep rooted and very strong - and it has a lot to do with the women who are used to rich lifestyles and so called 'security' that lifestyle provides. Can't have the cake and eat it also.<br /> <br />More later,<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Hi Madan,</p>
<p>Oh nice to know you are in Bangalore too :) Well, you might well be right about actual kannadigas in which case I would be very disappointed. The thing is, even in a small town like Mysore, I have seen girls walk by in all sorts of dresses without anyone commenting, or molesting them. I don't think even in a city like Coimbatore (which is bigger than Mysore) that is possible (and i should know.. my parents live there). In general I think we are quite hypocritical about our attitude to women.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>   I have been in Bangalore for over 5 years, and I agree that thats what you see on the surface. I even heard one friend of mine comment tohis daughter - 'Inga ponnunga evvalavu thairiyama nadakka mudiyuthu, kindal kaelikku aalaakama... .'.</p>
<p>   So far, so good. But I suggest you look at the 'real' kannadigas - hard to find in Bangalore thought ;) You would find that they have an equally conservative view about women in the family. In fact, kannadigas are far more patriotic about thier land and language than the common man in tamil nadu. I think this might extend to thier outlook on culture too.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Madan.</p>
<p>2008/9/5 Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@ gmail.com </p>
<p>Ok.. as a tamilian.. I think Tamizh Nadu is probably the MOST male chauvinistic of the four southern states. Having lived in TN and now living in Bangalore.. there is a marked difference in the way women are treated. In spiteof all talk of the "glorious Tamizh kalaachaaram" , I find that the way men even look at women in TN is rather lascivious.. . I do not find that herein Bangalore or not to any discernible extent. I think our pictures reinforce this to a large extent with Rajni, Vijay films etc coming up with dialogues like "Ponnu na adakkama irukkaNum".. etc etc.. completely ridiculous in this day and age but that's how it goes. I am sure if Rajni said stuff like that in his own home, his daughters wouldn't stand for it.. but hey.. the masses are happy. </p>
<p>Just my tuppence worth.</p>

<p>Priya, I did write a long reply, but realized that any response to this matter from a male has to be defensive, and I didnt like being there, and discarded the response. But am with you. I understand what you mean (my wife was a great eye-opener for me on this topic), and agree that as a society, wehave a long way to go to treat man and woman as equals.</p></madanus@gmail.></p>
<blockquote><p>  And have you noticed there wasn't much response to this subject....? ! </p></blockquote>
<p>Men expect to be treated the same way a woman expects to be treated. If there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that 'people' are not interested in responding - not that 'men' do not respond. Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group (apart fromMalathy, of course ;). And also you seem to equate the small subgroup thisforum is to larger one that is the society.</p>
<p>The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend to 'think' from their heart when they talk this subject. No offense meant, but do not hit below the belt.</p>

        <p>Hi Malathi,<br />I am from coimbatore.I disagree on this part of your mail-girls of coimbatore see movies, shop for saree , eat out and are thoroughly spoilt.please do come and see them now.There are women like Rajshree Pathy,Mrs.Nandhini Rangasamy,Dr.Asha Rao,Mrs .Rajini krishnamoorthy to name a few who are heading bussiness and educational institutions.Some youngsters in their late twenties are also managing schools very well.My friend whose family is one of the top ten families in coimbatore is in charge of a multi specality hospital and she runs it so well.<br />Even here in coimbatore you can see young girls zooming in their two wheelers late in the night.<br />with regards,<br />shanthi</p>

Most of my friends lived the area between RS Puram and mid Kovai (Chintamani). Talk of opulence and wealth, US suburbs look lower middle class compared to those mansions :)) </p>
<p>Kovai had its charms. People had money and were very laidback, quite unlike stress ridden Chennai :) Politeness was the norm, you could even ask a stranger for help. Auto people did not cheat. And it was safe (atleast in those days). My mom and me used to walk back after second show at night (since movies were the only time pass) with no fear of anyone or anything. I hear it is grossly overpopulated nowadays, and traffic/busyness has taken over, like anywhere else. </p>
<p>I am not surprised that your cousins had to be married off. If you live there a lot of conservative ideas sink in, slowly or surely. I have never ever seen girls so spoilt as they are in Kovai - life was about movies, eating out, and sari shopping, that is all. If all our friends are like that what do we do, same ultimately.</p>
<p>Where did you live in Kovai? Would love to hear more. I beleive Shoba also said she is from there.</p>

<p>Malathi, </p>
<p>You are from Coimbatore!! Well my parents are from coimbatore, all my aunts, uncles, cousin live there. My aunts (father's sisters) are very conservative that they did not let my elder sister do her masters saying "Neraya padichirundha maapila thedarathu kashtam". After marriage, she completed her masters.</p>
<p>I did my Masters from ADU, coimbatore. Unforgettable years in my life.</p>

<p>Arun, Coimbatore.. oh wow..I could write volumes..I grew up there...if you want to combine all the 'graamiya' movies made it would not take a candle to the conservativsm in Coimbatore as far as women go. When I went to school there - after 8th grade it is not ok to wear anything other than pavada/dhavani. It is not ok to sit next to a man in the bus even if I am a seventh grader and he is older than my grandpa. It is absolutely not ok for women to work (my cousin who used to work in a bank regularly used to face abuse even from customers, indha pappara ponnunga veetula irukkama inge enna pannareenga) . Coimbatore is the heartland of conservative TN - very rich people and very old conservative attitudes. Over 80% of the girls in my class of 53 girls were engaged to be married by the time we reached 9th grade. This was in the late 80s, not that far back. There was also a fairly large population of rich north indians where girls did as they pleased, but if you want to<br />relate to the local tamil populace, forget it you have to embrace what they think.</p>
<p>Some of it might have changed now. A lot of it I don't believe will change very easily. It is very deep rooted and very strong - and it has a lot to do with the women who are used to rich lifestyles and so called 'security' that lifestyle provides. Can't have the cake and eat it also.</p>
<p>More later,<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Hi Madan,</p>
<p>Oh nice to know you are in Bangalore too :) Well, you might well be right about actual kannadigas in which case I would be very disappointed. The thing is, even in a small town like Mysore, I have seen girls walk by in all sorts of dresses without anyone commenting, or molesting them. I don't think even in a city like Coimbatore (which is bigger than Mysore) that is possible (and i should know.. my parents live there). In general I think we are quite hypocritical about our attitude to women.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>I have been in Bangalore for over 5 years, and I agree that thats what you see on the surface. I even heard one friend of mine comment to his daughter - 'Inga ponnunga evvalavu thairiyama nadakka mudiyuthu, kindal kaelikku aalaakama... .'.</p>
<p>So far, so good. But I suggest you look at the 'real' kannadigas - hard to find in Bangalore thought ;) You would find that they have an equally conservative view about women in the family. In fact, kannadigas are far more patriotic about thier land and language than the common man in tamil nadu. I think this might extend to thier outlook on culture too.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Madan.</p>

<p>Ok.. as a tamilian.. I think Tamizh Nadu is probably the MOST male chauvinistic of the four southern states. Having lived in TN and now living in Bangalore.. there is a marked difference in the way women are treated. In spite of all talk of the "glorious Tamizh kalaachaaram" , I find that the way men even look at women in TN is rather lascivious.. . I do not find that here in Bangalore or not to any discernible extent. I think our pictures reinforce this to a large extent with Rajni, Vijay films etc coming up with dialogues like "Ponnu na adakkama irukkaNum".. etc etc.. completely ridiculous in this day and age but that's how it goes. I am sure if Rajni said stuff like that in his own home, his daughters wouldn't stand for it.. but hey.. the masses are happy. </p>
<p>Just my tuppence worth.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>Priya, I did write a long reply, but realized that any response to this matter from a male has to be defensive, and I didnt like being there, and discarded the response. But am with you. I understand what you mean (my wife was a great eye-opener for me on this topic), and agree that as a society, we have a long way to go to treat man and woman as equals.</p></madanus@gmail.></p>
<blockquote><p>  And have you noticed there wasn't much response to this subject....? ! </p></blockquote>
<p>Men expect to be treated the same way a woman expects to be treated. If there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that 'people' are not interested in responding - not that 'men' do not respond. Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group (apart from Malathy, of course ;). And also you seem to equate the small subgroup this forum is to larger one that is the society.</p>
<p>The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend to 'think' from their heart when they talk this subject. No offense meant, but do not hit below the belt.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Madan.</p>

<p>Thanks Malathi and Shri for your comments. </p>
<p>Malathi, What you told about women's mindset about women's self<br />respect is greatly true. I too accept it. And have you noticed there<br />wasn't much response to this subject....? ! </p>

<p>Let your wife take a bow from me. I salute that lady who had been a<br />visionary about real estates. But again the sample size is small from your<br />end as well. Both the parties can keep on quoting examples which will keep<br />this thread active for sometime. But I trust thats not the motive of this<br />thread.</p>
<p>In one of my earlier mails in this thread I have accepted that given the<br />freedom and suport women can shine in their fields and I quoted the case of<br />ICICI Bank. I will go even a step ahead, with the support and freeodm woman<br />out class / out smart men. But it is mandatory for ALL SUCESSFUL woman that<br />she gets freedom and support.</p>
<p>Where as MOST OF THE SUCESSFUL MEN didnt need support from woman. This is my<br />observation about the society. If I am proved wrong I am ready to eat my<br />words. After all this group is for learning new things / sharing ideas and<br />knowledge.</p>

        <p>Hi Satish,<br />I definitely dont agree your thought about men not excelling in taking care<br />of children.<br />My father is a living example of that.<br />having lost our mother at the tender age of 8 and 11 respectively, me and my<br />bro were brought up by my dad. And seriously we have not missed our mom till<br />date.<br />both of us are in a very good position now and we owe it all to our dad!<br />Hats off to him!</p>
<p>So i guess we can never generalize anything when it comes to human nature.<br />It depends so much on a person's upbringing, inidvidual characteristic.<br />Havent we seen cases were when a single mother fights teh society to bring<br />up her children but fails miserably.. (may be due to various reasons which<br />she may not be solely responsible.)</p>
<p>I do agree that a happy family is one where there's both mom and dad to<br />shower their affection on kids along with grandparents to impart their<br />wisdom.<br />But ofcourse, we dont live in a perfect world!</p>
<p>As for man backing a woman or vice-versa, I strongly believe it goes hand in<br />hand.<br />Be whatever be their career, i guess all the responsibilities are to be<br />shared by both in other to cope in a fast paced world where we need to<br />juggle with career, child care, home needs etc.<br />Times have changed now, with all the globalization, most of us into the IT<br />industry, are used to staying alone in foriegn countries. So there is no<br />excuse for a guy or a gal for not participating in household chores.. coz<br />they've already done it before!<br />So everything sums up to shredding off ego and share ur life with ur<br />partner.</p>

<blockquote><p>  On the other hand, we also should look at the plus and minus Nature<br />  has given us. Even if the male is ready to share the responsibility of<br />  household and bringing up children, the care that a mother gives can<br />  never be compared to that of the father. Not only humans, we can see<br />  this in every species. A women can raise her children without a males<br />  support but its next to impossible for a man to raise his children<br />  without a female support. Exceptions are there, but still in general,<br />  'nallavar aavathum theeyavar aavathum annai valarpinile' and not<br />  thanthai valarpinile....<br />  Thats why in India, we worship mother and see everything in female<br />  form too...our contry is motherland and not fatherland for the obvious<br />  reasons..</p>
<p>  A women can excel in career, but a man cannot excel in bringing up the<br />  child or a good home maker..</p>
<p>  my two paise worth...</p>

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>why dont we use this topic to study <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  men's mind set about <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  <br />womens self respect.</acronym></p>
<p>i think there are several instances.</p>
<p>first the head strong women nandini kundavi and poongkuzhali.<br />how the other kings ridicule nad fear nandini kundavi's growing power <br />in court circles and how kundavai keeps away physically by staying at <br />pazhaiyarai.<br />pungkuzhali too prefers staying away from mankind for similar <br />reasons. </p>
<p>vanathi and manimekalai could not have survived intodays' world. <br />they were submissive, the ideal sort of wifey materiel. manimekalai <br />rebels in her own way in the last. even vanathi dares to go alone to <br />search for amv.</p>
<p>sembian madevi too complains that people are complaining about her <br />spending too much.</p>
<p>all this was written in the forties.</p>
<p>i still see a lot of women around who strongly resemble these <br />charecters.</p>

        <p>Yes Definitely I agree there are things that men and women can do <br />better, child rearing happens to be one of them. Although in advanced <br />countries stay at home dads are very common and earning moms too. <br />Germany for example. Germany is also called fatherland btw :)).</p>
<p>I was talking of femininity also perhaps in the same context. Most <br />people think of women leaders as the stereotype Indira Gandhi/JJ model -<br />aggressive, ruthless and somewhat lacking in or ashamed of nurturing <br />skills. Bringing emotion into the workplace is often branded 'feminine' <br />and both men and women are branded 'softies' if they are caring, <br />nurturing,respect others and do not conform to stereotyped models of <br />leadership. </p>
<p>One of my favorite female leadership role models happens to be media <br />queen Oprah Winfrey. Oprah is not aggressive in public, does not <br />hesitate to show emotion and caring, and yet is a very successful <br />business woman and role model. Some virtues to learn from...</p>

        <p>On the other hand, we also should look at the plus and minus Nature<br />has given us. Even if the male is ready to share the responsibility of<br />household and bringing up children, the care that a mother gives can<br />never be compared to that of the father. Not only humans, we can see<br />this in every species. A women can raise her children without a males<br />support but its next to impossible for a man to raise his children<br />without a female support. Exceptions are there, but still in general,<br />'nallavar aavathum theeyavar aavathum annai valarpinile' and not<br />thanthai valarpinile....<br />Thats why in India, we worship mother and see everything in female<br />form too...our contry is motherland and not fatherland for the obvious<br />reasons..</p>
<p>A women can excel in career, but a man cannot excel in bringing up the<br />child or a good home maker..</p>

<p>Still most of the conservative families believe that responsibilities of the family like looking after the children etc., is believed to be a women's job rather than men's, although both should have the same responsibility. Women are expected to give preference to this rather than her career. Although most of the women can succeed in their carrier by themselves, its true that her husband has to share these family responsibilities, so that she could concentrate on her career. Its the same for men. If a wife depends on husband for all the house-hold jobs leaving little time for him to concentrate in his career, its obvious that he can't succeed in it.</p>

<p>Given the space and freedom Women are too good in their professional life. After K.V Kamath, till recently all the three No.2 in ICICI Bank were women. Also another fact about women is that without a backing Spouse / father / Mentor (Male) no women has won even a panjayat election. This was way back in early 90s when my English Professor quoted a research paper. Not sure whether that holds good even today.</p>

        <p>Ravi, aggression is not 'relentless pursuit', aggression is unfair <br />domination over others. It is not a male or female trait atleast as <br />far as humans go.</p>

<p>    Yes it is hard for a woman to succeed anywhere, even in an <br />ordinary <br />  work situation without backing of a man. It is simple statistics <br />  there are more men than women and it is still a man's world. I am <br />not <br />  sure if that is any more complex than that.<br />    ?<br />    Ravi, interesting to know that women are better strategists, <br />sounds <br />  logical to me since generally men are given to more direct thinking <br />  almost all the time. Very generally that is. Am not at all sure <br />about <br />  the marketing part,for one thing there are very few women in <br />  marketing compared to men and it would be unfair to draw any <br />  conclusion based on that.<br />    ?<br />    As far as generalising about innocence and other traits, well all <br />  people men or women are human. It is not possible to generalise <br />like <br />  that. But on the other hand an advanced society provides certain <br />  options to people who are caught in bad/troublesome situations. <br />  Unfortunately that is very much missing in India. A woman caught in <br />a <br />  sexual abuse situation is more than likely to be stigmatised (we <br />are <br />  Sita's country after all!!) let alone protected. <br />    ?<br />    Malathi</p>

<p>        I strongly believe both JJ and Indira Gandhi are men in women <br />    bodies, in<br />        other words they had to sacrifice all femininity to be where <br />  they <br />    are. Am<br />        not sure if that is the goal of every woman (definitely not <br />    mine). I have<br />        heard several women say that even in the States, that since <br />    climbing the<br />        corporate ladder means being a 'man' atleast technically they <br />    don't consider<br />        that progress. Feminine styles of leadership is not <br />understood <br />  at <br />    all,<br />        definitely not in male dominated societies such as India and <br />    United States.<br />        Some european cultures seemed better evolved in that regard - <br />    some women I<br />        have met from France and Sweden seemed lot more confident, <br />  gentle <br />    leaders<br />        without aggression. BTW there are lots of men who are like <br />that <br />    too who do<br />        not conform to traditional definions of being male (loud, <br />    aggressive,<br />        dominating) and yet are very good leaders in their own right.</p>
<p>        Am not sure if anyone has addressed this issue before, the #1 <br />    problem women<br />        have in India is sexual abuse at work. There is little/no <br />    protection from<br />        law, from managements, from anyone for a woman who faces <br />abuse <br />    from male<br />        managers and co workers. It is widely prevelant even in so <br />  called<br />        professional environments - the woman being married is <br />perhaps <br />    only a little<br />        safeguard.And of course, if you are not attractive noone is <br />    interested :)<br />        But there are lots of silent sufferers who do it for their <br />    families.</p>

<p>        Hi,</p>
<p>        some one had mentioned that women states of head in Asian <br />    countries. They<br />        have fallen into two categories mostly, either they are the <br />    powerful and<br />        autocractic like Indira Gandhi, Jayalalitha, Mayawati, Sheikh <br />    hasina,<br />        Benazir or they are controlled by invisible hands or a <br />coterie <br />    group like<br />        Sonia gandhi, rabri devi etc. Business world has thrown up <br />  people <br />    who are<br />        actually in between Indira Nooyi current hot-throb.</p>
<p>        I believe there is no stopping women who can be forceful but <br />not<br />        authoritarian. Glass ceiling has been shown to be broken many <br />    times, there<br />        might organizations which hold on to glass ceilings, but a <br />  little<br />        determination and setting up of priorities can get them to <br />  break <br />    it. As<br />        Napolean Hill says, dream it, desire it then you reach it. <br />  Nobody <br />    needs to<br />        give any freedom, you just take it as it is your right as a <br />  human <br />    being.</p>
<p>        Please dont look for hand-me-downs, especially quota system<br />  (most <br />    ill suited<br />        for women's needs). Traditional indian societies have come a <br />  long <br />    way from<br />        keeping women in their kitchens.</p>
<p>        It takes a long time for societal evils especially eve-<br />teasing <br />  to <br />    go away<br />        and Sex based Segregation helps promote eve-teasing and <br />    aggressive behaviour<br />        in boys.</p>
<p>        If Mother Teresa had been worried about such ills then she <br />  would <br />    have not<br />        accomplished so much in her time.</p>
<p>        Regards</p>

        <p>Dear Anandhi, very heart warming to hear from you. <br />?<br />Pazhamudhir solai opened when I was there, 8th grade i think. Just with lemon juice and sathukudi juice, small shop. How it has grown!! When I was young eating out was always Annapoorna. Annapoorna owners were our neighbors on subramanyam road - Chettiar and his wife and their 4 sons always courteous, we have been to all their family weddings and even grahapravesh when they moved to a palatial house on Periasamy theru. <br />?<br />All the movies we watched were at Kennedy and Shanmuga. Kennedy manager wasour neighbor so mostly free, on rare occasions or if the movie is a huge hit then Rs 2 for balcony. Quite unimaginable nowadays.<br />?<br />Yes in my time Kovai was called 'poor man's ooty' since it was very moderate climate wise, and lots of trees and greenery. The climate changes startedeven while i was there, am sure it is very hot now.But as you say hope it stays that?same in so many nostalgic ways?:))<br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Malathi,<br />?<br />? I lived in?R.S.Puram area too. I did my C?Programming from Aptech there long time back. The Aptech was near Pazhamudhir Cholai in RS puram. I started my carreer there as a data entry operator (the famous Tally software), for a Kannan Devan Tea agency also in RS.P. <br />?<br />? R.S. Puram is one of?my?favourite places there,?next is Saibaba colony (these two are proof?for the richness of the city). I hope it stillstays the same even though?it is crowded and everything. Last time I wasin coimbatore was 4 yrs back.?Had to go through lot of check posts to enter into the city. I have relatives lining from Singanallur to?Ganapathi to Perur.?I can still remember the bus routes?and streets crystal clear.?<br />?<br />? I do see how spoilt the girls are there. Most of cousins are married and settled in coimbatore. Not just sari shopping, jewelry shopping?too. Mythaatha wanted to get his daughters married?within coimbatore.?They were very protective of their kids. Until I was 5 yrs old, we were in coimbatore and then moved?out. My father worked?for Kamala (not sure of the name - from the LMW family) mills there.??<br />?<br />?? My chithappa used to write jokes?for AV (his name is KinathukadavuRavi). He?is in R.S.Puram. My aunties in Ramanathapuram, Big Bazar Street (famous periya kadai veethi),?cousins singanallur. I was?visiting my aunt?in Big Bazar street, coimbatore when the Pillaiyar drinking?milk?episode happened. Part of my masters I?stayed in Sungam (near Nirmala College).<br />?<br />??I can write on and on, I will?stop here.<br />?<br />Anandhi?,___ </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi Priya,</p>
<p>    I did not discard it because of inhibitions, but primarily the fact that<br />I didnt want to be defensive when answering the question (been there, done<br />that, never won any sympathy ;)</p>
<p>    So, I just mentioned the fact that I agree that women's position is<br />still not equal in our society... more than that it is inconsistent, like<br />somebody mentioned... some women do not get thier equal status, while some<br />misuse the laws to victimize men (I hear there are men's groups to counter<br />women misusing the law against them).</p>
<p>   Anyways, what I said in my first mail was really what I thought counted.<br />That a vast majority of moderate women still struggle to be considered<br />equal.</p>
<p>   I do not agree with the fact that women need to sacrifice 'femininity<br />(whats the darn spelling ;)' to become great. In fact, women should not<br />think about 'femininity'. I think 'femininity' itself is a male-dominated<br />concept. When a female lion fights its prey, the buck doesnt look at its<br />femininity, nor does the accompanying male. The very concept of femininity<br />(though makes the female look more dignified and beautiful), is a tool to<br />make women look different from men.</p>
<p>    'From the heart': I think this is a more emotional issue than factual<br />for most women I have met. In all probability, they are respected, and<br />treated equal in the family (not in the society), but still long to do<br />something for the others who are not so privileged. It is like a a<br />well-educated person discussing illitracy, and not doing anything about it.</p>
<p>    I thought I should say that, because, you mentioned that "there was not<br />much response to this topic". I wondered if you would have ever said that<br />about any other topic. Dont think so. Thats why I said that (Yes, I meant<br />that you were speaking from your heart).</p>
<p>    I rest my case.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Madan.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Madan, Thanks for your response. You said you wrote a long reply and<br />  discarded being a male. There is nothing wrong in posting whatever your<br />  views are.  Please don't have any inhibitions.  What I feel is whenever we<br />  think about an issue, our gender/sex (whether male or female) should have no<br />  effect on it. Otherwise, it might be biased.<br />  By the way, I donot understand what you imply by most women tend to 'think'<br />  from their heart, please clarify.<br />  Regards,<br />  Priya</p>

<p>   Priya, I did write a long reply, but realized that any response to this<br />  matter from a male has to be defensive, and I didnt like being there, and<br />  discarded the response. But am with you. I understand what you mean (my wife<br />  was a great eye-opener for me on this topic), and agree that as a society,<br />  we have a long way to go to treat man and woman as equals.</p>
<p>    And have you noticed there wasn't much response to this subject....? !</p>
<p>  Men expect to be treated the same way a woman expects to be treated. If<br />  there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that<br />  'people' are not interested in responding - not that 'men' do not respond.<br />  Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group<br />  (apart from Malathy, of course ;). And also you seem to equate the small<br />  subgroup this forum is to larger one that is the society.</p>
<p>  The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend to<br />  'think' from their heart when they talk this subject. No offense meant, but<br />  do not hit below the belt.</p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Madan.</p>

<priyabalasundari@ yahoo.com <priyabalasundari@yahoo.com  </p>
<p>   Thanks Malathi and Shri for your comments.</p>
<p>   Malathi, What you told about women's mindset about women's self<br />   respect is greatly true. I too accept it. And have you noticed there<br />   wasn't much response to this subject....? !</p>
<p>   regards<br />   Priya</p>

        <p>Hi all,<br /> <br />The Indian Law is one of the most complex and has all the solutions and caters to situations faced by woman in general. Except that the implementationof the law of the land is at a very pathetic level. As citizens, women should approach and get relief by the getting the law of the land into implementation mode.<br /> <br />Regards<br />Nanda</p>

<p>Yes it is hard for a woman to succeed anywhere, even in an ordinary work situation without backing of a man. It is simple statistics there are more men than women and it is still a man's world. I am not sure if that is any more complex than that.</p>
<p>Ravi, interesting to know that women are better strategists, sounds logicalto me since generally men are given to more direct thinking almost all thetime. Very generally that is. Am not at all sure about the marketing part,for one thing there are very few women in marketing compared to men and it would be unfair to draw any conclusion based on that.</p>
<p>As far as generalising about innocence and other traits, well all people men or women are human. It is not possible to generalise like that. But on the other hand an advanced society provides certain options to people who arecaught in bad/troublesome situations. Unfortunately that is very much missing in India. A woman caught in a sexual abuse situation is more than likely to be stigmatised (we are Sita's country after all!!) let alone protected. </p>

<p>Given the space and freedom Women are too good in their professional life. After K.V Kamath, till recently all the three No.2 in ICICI Bank were women. Also another fact about women is that without a backing Spouse / father /Mentor (Male) no women has won even a panjayat election. This was way backin early 90s when my English Professor quoted a research paper. Not sure whether that holds good even today.</p>

Am<br />    not sure if that is the goal of every woman (definitely not <br />mine). I have<br />    heard several women say that even in the States, that since <br />climbing the<br />    corporate ladder means being a 'man' atleast technically they <br />don't consider<br />    that progress. Feminine styles of leadership is not understood at <br />all,<br />    definitely not in male dominated societies such as India and <br />United States.<br />    Some european cultures seemed better evolved in that regard - <br />some women I<br />    have met from France and Sweden seemed lot more confident, gentle <br />leaders<br />    without aggression. BTW there are lots of men who are like that <br />too who do<br />    not conform to traditional definions of being male (loud, <br />aggressive,<br />    dominating) and yet are very good leaders in their own right.</p>
<p>    Am not sure if anyone has addressed this issue before, the #1 <br />problem women<br />    have in India is sexual abuse at work. There is little/no <br />protection from<br />    law, from managements, from anyone for a woman who faces abuse <br />from male<br />    managers and co workers. It is widely prevelant even in so called<br />    professional environments - the woman being married is perhaps <br />only a little<br />    safeguard.And of course, if you are not attractive noone is <br />interested :)<br />    But there are lots of silent sufferers who do it for their <br />families.</p>

<p>    Hi,</p>
<p>    some one had mentioned that women states of head in Asian <br />countries. They<br />    have fallen into two categories mostly, either they are the <br />powerful and<br />    autocractic like Indira Gandhi, Jayalalitha, Mayawati, Sheikh <br />hasina,<br />    Benazir or they are controlled by invisible hands or a coterie <br />group like<br />    Sonia gandhi, rabri devi etc. Business world has thrown up people <br />who are<br />    actually in between Indira Nooyi current hot-throb.</p>
<p>    I believe there is no stopping women who can be forceful but not<br />    authoritarian. Glass ceiling has been shown to be broken many <br />times, there<br />    might organizations which hold on to glass ceilings, but a little<br />    determination and setting up of priorities can get them to break <br />it. As<br />    Napolean Hill says, dream it, desire it then you reach it. Nobody <br />needs to<br />    give any freedom, you just take it as it is your right as a human <br />being.</p>
<p>    Please dont look for hand-me-downs, especially quota system(most <br />ill suited<br />    for women's needs). Traditional indian societies have come a long <br />way from<br />    keeping women in their kitchens.</p>
<p>    It takes a long time for societal evils especially eve-teasing to <br />go away<br />    and Sex based Segregation helps promote eve-teasing and <br />aggressive behaviour<br />    in boys.</p>
<p>    If Mother Teresa had been worried about such ills then she would <br />have not<br />    accomplished so much in her time.</p>
<p>    Regards</p>
<p>    Nanda</p>

<p>    I was able to read the tamil version, but the subject is too <br />complicated<br />    for me to channelize my thoughts.</p>
<p>    In my opinion, women have freedom. Some use it, some don't use <br />it and<br />    many abuse it.</p>

There is little/no protection from law, from managements, from anyone for a woman who faces abuse from male managers and co workers. It is widely prevelant even in so called professional environments - the woman being married is perhaps only a little safeguard.And of course, if you are not attractive noone is interested :) But there are lots of silent sufferers who do it for their families. <br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Hi,<br />?<br />some one had mentioned that women states of head in Asian countries. They have fallen into two categories mostly, either they are the powerful and autocractic like Indira Gandhi, Jayalalitha, Mayawati, Sheikh hasina, Benazir or they are?controlled by invisible hands or a coterie group like Sonia gandhi, rabri devi etc. Business world has thrown up people who are actuallyin between Indira Nooyi current hot-throb. <br />?<br />I believe there is no stopping women?who can be forceful but not authoritarian. Glass ceiling has been shown to be broken many times, there might organizations which hold on to glass ceilings, but a little determination andsetting up of priorities can get them to break it. As Napolean Hill says, dream it, desire it then you?reach it. Nobody needs to give any freedom, you?just take it as it is your right as a human being.<br />?<br />Please dont look for hand-me-downs, especially quota system(most ill suitedfor women's needs). Traditional indian societies have come a long way fromkeeping women in their kitchens. <br />?<br />It takes a long time for societal evils especially eve-teasing to go away and Sex based Segregation?helps promote?eve-teasing and aggressive behaviour in boys. <br />?<br />If Mother Teresa had been worried about such ills then she would have not accomplished so much in her time.<br />?<br />Regards<br />?<br />Nanda</p>

There is little/no <br />  protection from<br />      law, from managements, from anyone for a woman who faces abuse <br />  from male<br />      managers and co workers. It is widely prevelant even in so <br />called<br />      professional environments - the woman being married is perhaps <br />  only a little<br />      safeguard.And of course, if you are not attractive noone is <br />  interested :)<br />      But there are lots of silent sufferers who do it for their <br />  families.</p>

<p>      Hi,</p>
<p>      some one had mentioned that women states of head in Asian <br />  countries. They<br />      have fallen into two categories mostly, either they are the <br />  powerful and<br />      autocractic like Indira Gandhi, Jayalalitha, Mayawati, Sheikh <br />  hasina,<br />      Benazir or they are controlled by invisible hands or a coterie <br />  group like<br />      Sonia gandhi, rabri devi etc. Business world has thrown up <br />people <br />  who are<br />      actually in between Indira Nooyi current hot-throb.</p>
<p>      I believe there is no stopping women who can be forceful but not<br />      authoritarian. Glass ceiling has been shown to be broken many <br />  times, there<br />      might organizations which hold on to glass ceilings, but a <br />little<br />      determination and setting up of priorities can get them to <br />break <br />  it. As<br />      Napolean Hill says, dream it, desire it then you reach it. <br />Nobody <br />  needs to<br />      give any freedom, you just take it as it is your right as a <br />human <br />  being.</p>
<p>      Please dont look for hand-me-downs, especially quota system<br />(most <br />  ill suited<br />      for women's needs). Traditional indian societies have come a <br />long <br />  way from<br />      keeping women in their kitchens.</p>
<p>      It takes a long time for societal evils especially eve-teasing <br />to <br />  go away<br />      and Sex based Segregation helps promote eve-teasing and <br />  aggressive behaviour<br />      in boys.</p>
<p>      If Mother Teresa had been worried about such ills then she <br />would <br />  have not<br />      accomplished so much in her time.</p>
<p>      Regards</p>
<p>      Nanda</p>

        <p>Yes it is hard for a woman to succeed anywhere, even in an ordinary work situation without backing of a man. It is simple statistics there are more men than women and it is still a man's world. I am not sure if that is any more complex than that.<br />?<br />Ravi, interesting to know that women are better strategists, sounds logicalto me since generally men are given to more direct thinking almost all thetime. Very generally that is. Am not at all sure about the marketing part,for one thing there are very few women in marketing compared to men and it would be unfair to draw any conclusion based on that.<br />?<br />As far as generalising about innocence and other traits, well all people men or women are human. It is not possible to generalise like that. But on the other hand an advanced society provides certain options to people who arecaught in bad/troublesome situations. Unfortunately that is very much missing in India. A woman caught in a sexual abuse situation is more than likely to be stigmatised (we are Sita's country after all!!) let alone protected. <br />?<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Given the space and freedom Women are too good in their professional life. After K.V Kamath, till recently all the three No.2 in ICICI Bank were women. Also another fact about women is that without a backing Spouse / father /Mentor (Male) no women has won even a panjayat election. This was way backin early 90s when my?English?Professor quoted a research paper. Not sure whether that holds good even today.</p>

<p>      I strongly believe both JJ and Indira Gandhi are men in women<br />  bodies, in<br />      other words they had to sacrifice all femininity to be where they<br />  are.

<p>      Am not sure if anyone has addressed this issue before, the #1<br />  problem women<br />      have in India is sexual abuse at work.

<p>      Hi,</p>
<p>      some one had mentioned that women states of head in Asian<br />  countries. They<br />      have fallen into two categories mostly, either they are the<br />  powerful and<br />      autocractic like Indira Gandhi, Jayalalitha, Mayawati, Sheikh<br />  hasina,<br />      Benazir or they are controlled by invisible hands or a coterie<br />  group like<br />      Sonia gandhi, rabri devi etc. Business world has thrown up people<br />  who are<br />      actually in between Indira Nooyi current hot-throb.</p>
<p>      I believe there is no stopping women who can be forceful but not<br />      authoritarian. Glass ceiling has been shown to be broken many<br />  times, there<br />      might organizations which hold on to glass ceilings, but a little<br />      determination and setting up of priorities can get them to break<br />  it. As<br />      Napolean Hill says, dream it, desire it then you reach it. Nobody<br />  needs to<br />      give any freedom, you just take it as it is your right as a human<br />  being.</p>
<p>      Please dont look for hand-me-downs, especially quota system(most<br />  ill suited<br />      for women's needs). Traditional indian societies have come a long<br />  way from<br />      keeping women in their kitchens.</p>
<p>      It takes a long time for societal evils especially eve-teasing to<br />  go away<br />      and Sex based Segregation helps promote eve-teasing and<br />  aggressive behaviour<br />      in boys.</p>
<p>      If Mother Teresa had been worried about such ills then she would<br />  have not<br />      accomplished so much in her time.</p>
<p>      Regards</p>
<p>      Nanda</p>

<p>      In my opinion, women have freedom. Some use it, some don't use<br />  it and<br />      many abuse it.</p>

        <p>Yes there are some real bad people out there who dont have any ethics <br />or moral behavior. Predators are always going to be there, how the <br />deer survives in the savannah is nature at its best.</p>
<p>Women are usually better in handling strategies in politics, unusual <br />comment, but stats say so, they also take old decisions and usually <br />they are fearless on taking decisions. Women also out perform men in <br />marketing/sales activities. Men must learn to admire and respect the <br />talent available and also not lose out on learning standing behind a <br />charm of ego.</p>
<p>However, it would be prudent to say that all women are innocent and <br />only victims of circumstances. There are some real charecters out <br />there. Eppavuma gundoosi kulla nool nozhaya mudiyathu....</p>

<p>  Hi,</p>
<p>  some one had mentioned that women states of head in Asian countries. They<br />  have fallen into two categories mostly, either they are the powerful and<br />  autocractic like Indira Gandhi, Jayalalitha, Mayawati, Sheikh hasina,<br />  Benazir or they are controlled by invisible hands or a coterie group like<br />  Sonia gandhi, rabri devi etc. Business world has thrown up people who are<br />  actually in between Indira Nooyi current hot-throb.</p>
<p>  I believe there is no stopping women who can be forceful but not<br />  authoritarian. Glass ceiling has been shown to be broken many times, there<br />  might organizations which hold on to glass ceilings, but a little<br />  determination and setting up of priorities can get them to break it. As<br />  Napolean Hill says, dream it, desire it then you reach it. Nobody needs to<br />  give any freedom, you just take it as it is your right as a human being.</p>
<p>  Please dont look for hand-me-downs, especially quota system(most ill suited<br />  for women's needs). Traditional indian societies have come a long way from<br />  keeping women in their kitchens.</p>
<p>  It takes a long time for societal evils especially eve-teasing to go away<br />  and Sex based Segregation helps promote eve-teasing and aggressive behaviour<br />  in boys.</p>
<p>  If Mother Teresa had been worried about such ills then she would have not<br />  accomplished so much in her time.</p>
<p>  Regards</p>
<p>  Nanda</p>

<p>  In my opinion, women have freedom. Some use it, some don't use it and<br />  many abuse it.</p>

        <p>Nandakumar, very well said!! <br />?<br />I strongly believe both JJ and Indira Gandhi are men in women bodies, in other words they had to sacrifice all femininity to be where they are. Am notsure if that is the goal of every woman (definitely not mine). I have heard several women say that even in the States, that since climbing the corporate ladder means being a 'man' atleast technically they don't consider thatprogress. Feminine styles of leadership is not understood at all, definitely not in male dominated societies such as India and United States. Some european cultures seemed better evolved in that regard - some women I have met from France and Sweden seemed lot more confident, gentle leaders without aggression. BTW there are lots of men who are like that too who do not conform to traditional definions of being male (loud, aggressive, dominating) and yet are very good leaders in their own right. <br />?<br />Am not sure if anyone has addressed this issue before, the #1 problem womenhave in India is sexual abuse at work. There is little/no protection from law, from managements, from anyone for a woman who faces abuse from male managers and co workers. It is widely prevelant even in so called professional environments - the woman being married is perhaps only a little safeguard.And of course, if you are not attractive noone is interested :) But there are lots of silent sufferers who do it for their families. <br />?<br />Malathi</p>

        <p>Dear Malathi , Anandhi<br />I live in Kovai now. Grew up in Chennai. We've been here only for 5+ yrs.now. <br />Kovai continues to be polite &amp; has not lost any of the charms Malathi mentioned. The Auto drivers have changed though, I cannot say they cheat but they charge the moon, you end up paying more than you would in Chennai for thesame distance. I do not know if it is still safe at night, but mornings asearly as 5a.m. I've seen women walking alone in the race course &amp; it is quite safe to do that. I've not seen any eveteasing in the last 5 yrs. Peoplecontinue to be conservative , I would rather use the word traditional,  women are educated &amp; go to work too, may be not from the affluent business families. <br />As for equality or freedom of women I'd say it totally depends on the womanto establish her individuality, while keeping the family in mind. <br />Regards<br />Shobha</p>

<p>Dear Anandhi, yes I grew up in Kovai, unforgettable years for me too!! We lived in the RS Puram area. I went to school at St Josephs. Most of my friends lived the area between RS Puram and mid Kovai (Chintamani). Talk of opulence and wealth, US suburbs look lower middle class compared to those mansions :)) <br /> <br />Kovai had its charms. People had money and were very laidback, quite unlikestress ridden Chennai :) Politeness was the norm, you could even ask a stranger for help. Auto people did not cheat. And it was safe (atleast in those days). My mom and me used to walk back after second show at night (since movies were the only time pass) with no fear of anyone or anything. I hear it is grossly overpopulated nowadays, and traffic/busyness has taken over, like anywhere else. <br /> <br />I am not surprised that your cousins had to be married off. If you live there a lot of conservative ideas sink in, slowly or surely. I have never everseen girls so spoilt as they are in Kovai - life was about movies, eating out, and sari shopping, that is all. If all our friends are like that what do we do, same ultimately.<br /> <br />Where did you live in Kovai? Would love to hear more. I beleive Shoba also said she is from there.<br /> <br />Malathi</p>

<p>Malathi, <br /> <br />  You are from Coimbatore!! Well my parents are from coimbatore, all my aunts, uncles, cousin live there. My aunts (father's sisters) are very conservative that they did not let my elder sister do her masters saying "Neraya padichirundha maapila thedarathu kashtam". After marriage, she completed her masters.<br /> <br />  I did my Masters from ADU, coimbatore. Unforgettable yearsin my life.<br /> <br />Anandhi</p>

<p>Arun, Coimbatore.. oh wow..I could write volumes..I grew up there...if you want to combine all the 'graamiya' movies made it would not take a candle to the conservativsm in Coimbatore as far as women go. When I went to schoolthere - after 8th grade it is not ok to wear anything other than pavada/dhavani. It is not ok to sit next to a man in the bus even if I am a seventh grader and he is older than my grandpa. It is absolutely not ok for women to work (my cousin who used to work in a bank regularly used to face abuse even from customers, indha pappara ponnunga veetula irukkama inge enna pannareenga) . Coimbatore is the heartland of conservative TN - very rich peopleand very old conservative attitudes. Over 80% of the girls in my class of 53 girls were engaged to be married by the time we reached 9th grade. This was in the late 80s, not that far back. There was also a fairly large population of rich north indians where girls did as they pleased, but if<br />you want to relate to the local tamil populace, forget it you have to embrace what they think.<br /> <br />Some of it might have changed now. A lot of it I don't believe will change very easily. It is very deep rooted and very strong - and it has a lot to do with the women who are used to rich lifestyles and so called 'security' that lifestyle provides. Can't have the cake and eat it also.<br /> <br />More later,<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Hi Madan,</p>
<p>Oh nice to know you are in Bangalore too :) Well, you might well be right about actual kannadigas in which case I would be very disappointed. The thing is, even in a small town like Mysore, I have seen girls walk by in all sorts of dresses without anyone commenting, or molesting them. I don't think even in a city like Coimbatore (which is bigger than Mysore) that is possible (and i should know.. my parents live there). In general I think we are quite hypocritical about our attitude to women.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>   I have been in Bangalore for over 5 years, and I agree that thats what you see on the surface. I even heard one friend of mine comment tohis daughter - 'Inga ponnunga evvalavu thairiyama nadakka mudiyuthu, kindal kaelikku aalaakama... .'.</p>
<p>   So far, so good. But I suggest you look at the 'real' kannadigas - hard to find in Bangalore thought ;) You would find that they have an equally conservative view about women in the family. In fact, kannadigas are far more patriotic about thier land and language than the common man in tamil nadu. I think this might extend to thier outlook on culture too.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Madan.</p>
<p>2008/9/5 Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@ gmail.com </p>
<p>Ok.. as a tamilian.. I think Tamizh Nadu is probably the MOST male chauvinistic of the four southern states. Having lived in TN and now living in Bangalore.. there is a marked difference in the way women are treated. In spiteof all talk of the "glorious Tamizh kalaachaaram" , I find that the way men even look at women in TN is rather lascivious.. . I do not find that herein Bangalore or not to any discernible extent. I think our pictures reinforce this to a large extent with Rajni, Vijay films etc coming up with dialogues like "Ponnu na adakkama irukkaNum".. etc etc.. completely ridiculous in this day and age but that's how it goes. I am sure if Rajni said stuff like that in his own home, his daughters wouldn't stand for it.. but hey.. the masses are happy. </p>
<p>Just my tuppence worth.</p>

<p>Priya, I did write a long reply, but realized that any response to this matter from a male has to be defensive, and I didnt like being there, and discarded the response. But am with you. I understand what you mean (my wife was a great eye-opener for me on this topic), and agree that as a society, wehave a long way to go to treat man and woman as equals.</p></madanus@gmail.></p>
<blockquote><p>  And have you noticed there wasn't much response to this subject....? ! </p></blockquote>
<p>Men expect to be treated the same way a woman expects to be treated. If there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that 'people' are not interested in responding - not that 'men' do not respond. Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group (apart fromMalathy, of course ;). And also you seem to equate the small subgroup thisforum is to larger one that is the society.</p>
<p>The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend to 'think' from their heart when they talk this subject. No offense meant, but do not hit below the belt.</p>

        <p>Actually I have mixed thoughts/experiences on that. Atleast in US. I have handled several home renovation projects and dealt with contractors - painters, electricians, plumbers etc. Be clear in communication, specific about $that is all and most of the time work gets done. I must confess I cannot possibly do that back home. I don't know how to deal with laborers in indianfashion and bargain about money. I don't bargain in India, am too soft hearted to bargain with people who sell vegetables and make a hundred times less money than I do. And what that means is to be taken for a long merry ride. <br />?<br />In US you cannot get things done if you are condescending or patronizing. People do not like that at all. A plumber is like a software engineer. Just another profession. As long as we can remember that it is usually easy. Usually. </p>

<p>Dear Venketesh,</p>
<p>This group is not really typical of the average Tamilian I think. If only our state could be the way this group is.. where women are treated with respect.. their opinions listened to etc. I think there is still a tendency in our state, why, even in India to not really pay much attention to what a woman says. My wife is finding this out now, even in Bangalore. While lookingfor apartments/houses, if I spoke to the agents, the response would be much more positive/faster than if she were to go around making calls. Is driving her nuts!</p>
<p>I don't mean to imply that a girl wearing jeans is more liberated than one wearing a paavadai thavani.. it has more to deal with how our men view women in general. In Sinapore, when we lived there, the ONLY place where women were reluctant to go was to little India. My cousin summed it up succinctly.. "Kannalaye Rape panniduvaanga" .. we never found this anywhere else in Singapore.. so this has something to do with our culture.. Tamil/Indian callit what you will. Maybe the conservativeness and the segregation of sexes from a very young age, leads to suppressed feelings which comes out as boorishness. It is a harsh truth, but truth nonetheless :)</p>

<p>Hi Madan,</p>
<p>Oh nice to know you are in Bangalore too :) Well, you might well be right about actual kannadigas in which case I would be very disappointed. The thing is, even in a small town like Mysore, I have seen girls walk by in all sorts of dresses without anyone commenting, or molesting them. I don't think even in a city like Coimbatore (which is bigger than Mysore) that is possible (and i should know.. my parents live there). In general I think we are quite hypocritical about our attitude to women.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>   I have been in Bangalore for over 5 years, and I agree that thats what you see on the surface. I even heard one friend of mine comment tohis daughter - 'Inga ponnunga evvalavu thairiyama nadakka mudiyuthu, kindal kaelikku aalaakama... .'.</p>
<p>   So far, so good. But I suggest you look at the 'real' kannadigas - hard to find in Bangalore thought ;) You would find that they have an equally conservative view about women in the family. In fact, kannadigas are far more patriotic about thier land and language than the common man in tamil nadu. I think this might extend to thier outlook on culture too.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Madan.</p>
<p>2008/9/5 Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@ gmail.com </p>
<p>Ok.. as a tamilian.. I think Tamizh Nadu is probably the MOST male chauvinistic of the four southern states. Having lived in TN and now living in Bangalore.. there is a marked difference in the way women are treated. In spiteof all talk of the "glorious Tamizh kalaachaaram" , I find that the way men even look at women in TN is rather lascivious.. . I do not find that herein Bangalore or not to any discernible extent. I think our pictures reinforce this to a large extent with Rajni, Vijay films etc coming up with dialogues like "Ponnu na adakkama irukkaNum".. etc etc.. completely ridiculous in this day and age but that's how it goes. I am sure if Rajni said stuff like that in his own home, his daughters wouldn't stand for it.. but hey.. the masses are happy. </p>
<p>Just my tuppence worth.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>Priya, I did write a long reply, but realized that any response to this matter from a male has to be defensive, and I didnt like being there, and discarded the response. But am with you. I understand what you mean (my wife was a great eye-opener for me on this topic), and agree that as a society, wehave a long way to go to treat man and woman as equals.</p></madanus@gmail.></p>
<blockquote><p>  And have you noticed there wasn't much response to this subject....? ! </p></blockquote>
<p>Men expect to be treated the same way a woman expects to be treated. If there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that 'people' are not interested in responding - not that 'men' do not respond. Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group (apart fromMalathy, of course ;). And also you seem to equate the small subgroup thisforum is to larger one that is the society.</p>
<p>The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend to 'think' from their heart when they talk this subject. No offense meant, but do not hit below the belt.</p>

        <p>Madan, Thanks for your response. You said you wrote a long reply and discarded being a male. There is nothing wrong in posting whatever your views are. Please don't have any inhibitions. What I feel is whenever we think about an issue, our gender/sex (whether male or female) should have no effecton it. Otherwise, it might be biased. <br />By the way, I donot understand what you imply by most women tend<br />to 'think' from their heart, please clarify. <br />Regards,<br />Priya</p>

<p>Priya, now that you presented it again there will be more comments, we havetalked about this before, albeit in somewhat different ways. We had a really extensive discussion on the practice of Sati and its references in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym . Ialso tried to present a modern version of Kalki's Thyaga Bhoomi, arguably his best work as far as social justice and women's issues go. Have you readit?</p>

        <p>Malathi, <br /> <br />  You are from Coimbatore!! Well my parents are from coimbatore, all my aunts, uncles, cousin live there. My aunts (father's sisters) are very conservative that they did not let my elder sister do her masters saying "Neraya padichirundha maapila thedarathu kashtam". After marriage, she completed her masters.<br /> <br />  I did my Masters from ADU, coimbatore. Unforgettable yearsin my life.<br /> <br />Anandhi</p>

<p>Arun, Coimbatore.. oh wow..I could write volumes..I grew up there...if you want to combine all the 'graamiya' movies made it would not take a candle to the conservativsm in Coimbatore as far as women go. When I went to schoolthere - after 8th grade it is not ok to wear anything other than pavada/dhavani. It is not ok to sit next to a man in the bus even if I am a seventh grader and he is older than my grandpa. It is absolutely not ok for women to work (my cousin who used to work in a bank regularly used to face abuse even from customers, indha pappara ponnunga veetula irukkama inge enna pannareenga) . Coimbatore is the heartland of conservative TN - very rich peopleand very old conservative attitudes. Over 80% of the girls in my class of 53 girls were engaged to be married by the time we reached 9th grade. This was in the late 80s, not that far back. There was also a fairly large population of rich north indians where girls did as they pleased, but if<br />you want to relate to the local tamil populace, forget it you have to embrace what they think.<br /> <br />Some of it might have changed now. A lot of it I don't believe will change very easily. It is very deep rooted and very strong - and it has a lot to do with the women who are used to rich lifestyles and so called 'security' that lifestyle provides. Can't have the cake and eat it also.<br /> <br />More later,<br />Malathi</p>

<p>Hi Madan,</p>
<p>Oh nice to know you are in Bangalore too :) Well, you might well be right about actual kannadigas in which case I would be very disappointed. The thing is, even in a small town like Mysore, I have seen girls walk by in all sorts of dresses without anyone commenting, or molesting them. I don't think even in a city like Coimbatore (which is bigger than Mysore) that is possible (and i should know.. my parents live there). In general I think we are quite hypocritical about our attitude to women.</p>

<p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>   I have been in Bangalore for over 5 years, and I agree that thats what you see on the surface. I even heard one friend of mine comment tohis daughter - 'Inga ponnunga evvalavu thairiyama nadakka mudiyuthu, kindal kaelikku aalaakama... .'.</p>
<p>   So far, so good. But I suggest you look at the 'real' kannadigas - hard to find in Bangalore thought ;) You would find that they have an equally conservative view about women in the family. In fact, kannadigas are far more patriotic about thier land and language than the common man in tamil nadu. I think this might extend to thier outlook on culture too.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Madan.</p>
<p>2008/9/5 Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@ gmail.com </p>
<p>Ok.. as a tamilian.. I think Tamizh Nadu is probably the MOST male chauvinistic of the four southern states. Having lived in TN and now living in Bangalore.. there is a marked difference in the way women are treated. In spiteof all talk of the "glorious Tamizh kalaachaaram" , I find that the way men even look at women in TN is rather lascivious.. . I do not find that herein Bangalore or not to any discernible extent. I think our pictures reinforce this to a large extent with Rajni, Vijay films etc coming up with dialogues like "Ponnu na adakkama irukkaNum".. etc etc.. completely ridiculous in this day and age but that's how it goes. I am sure if Rajni said stuff like that in his own home, his daughters wouldn't stand for it.. but hey.. the masses are happy. </p>
<p>Just my tuppence worth.</p>

<p>Priya, I did write a long reply, but realized that any response to this matter from a male has to be defensive, and I didnt like being there, and discarded the response. But am with you. I understand what you mean (my wife was a great eye-opener for me on this topic), and agree that as a society, wehave a long way to go to treat man and woman as equals.</p></madanus@gmail.></p>
<blockquote><p>  And have you noticed there wasn't much response to this subject....? ! </p></blockquote>
<p>Men expect to be treated the same way a woman expects to be treated. If there is no response to the topic, please see it as an indication that 'people' are not interested in responding - not that 'men' do not respond. Also, you seem to already assume that there are only men in this group (apart fromMalathy, of course ;). And also you seem to equate the small subgroup thisforum is to larger one that is the society.</p>
<p>The above statement of yours reaffirms my belief that most women tend to 'think' from their heart when they talk this subject. No offense meant, but do not hit below the belt.</p>

<p>Dear Venketesh,</p>
<p>This group is not really typical of the average Tamilian I think. If only our state could be the way this group is.. where women are treated with respect.. their opinions listened to etc. I think there is still a tendency in our state, why, even in India to not really pay much attention to what a woman says. My wife is finding this out now, even in Bangalore. While lookingfor apartments/houses, if I spoke to the agents, the response would be much more positive/faster than if she were to go around making calls. Is driving her nuts!</p>
<p>I don't mean to imply that a girl wearing jeans is more liberated than one wearing a paavadai thavani.. it has more to deal with how our men view women in general. In Sinapore, when we lived there, the ONLY place where women were reluctant to go was to little India. My cousin summed it up succinctly.. "Kannalaye Rape panniduvaanga".. we never found this anywhere else in Singapore.. so this has something to do with our culture.. Tamil/Indian call it what you will. Maybe the conservativeness and the segregation of sexes from a very young age, leads to suppressed feelings which comes out as boorishness. It is a harsh truth, but truth nonetheless :)</p>

        <p>I think one of the mistakes we make is in thinking that just because we have<br />a female head of state or a female head of a political party, women are<br />treated well in India. We have Goddesses .. but that doesn't mean that we<br />treat women well by any stretch of the imagination. As Malathy said, more<br />than the opportunities that women get, it is in the way that men view women<br />that needs to be changed. As tamilians, it is up to us to be that change!<br />Regards,</p>

<p>Looking for these words only .. very well crafted !</p>
<p>I would milder it saying by eating a cake, we have to compromise on <br />its entirity !</p>
<p>But I was also thinking on other lines ::</p>
<p>Like Devi Mahathmiyam .. when composed ? who ?</p>
<p>Here Dr. Kalikkovan's extensive research of PENN DEYVA VAZHIPADU <br />also will throw more light..</p>
<p>And Aadhi Sankara's Soundarya Lahiri ..! Abhirami Andhadi. !</p>
<p>Recall Writer Balakumaran's EN KANN MANITHAAMARAI (novel related to <br />worshipping Wife) also.</p>
