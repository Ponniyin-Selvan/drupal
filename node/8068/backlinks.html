<p>FROM A POLICE OFFICER / FORWARD MESSAGE ::</p>
<p>Someone just told me that her friend heard <br />a crying baby on her porch the night before last, <br />and she called the police because it was late <br />and she thought it was weird.. <br />The police told her <br />'Whatever you do, DO NOT <br />open the door..' <br />The lady then said that it sounded like the baby <br />had crawled near a window, and she was worried <br />that it would crawl to the street and get run over. <br />The policeman said, 'We already have a unit on the way, <br />whatever you do, DO NOT open the door.' <br />He told her that they think a serial killer <br />has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax <br />women out of their homes thinking that someone <br />dropped off a baby. He said they have not verified it, <br />but have had several calls by women saying that <br />they hear baby's cries outside their doors <br />when they're home alone at night. <br />=================</p>
<p>Because of recent abductions <br />In daylight hours, refresh yourself <br />of these things to do in an emergency </p>
<p>situation... <br />This is for you, and for you to share <br />with your wife, your children, <br />everyone you know. <br />After reading these 9 crucial tips, <br />forward them to someone you care about. <br />It never hurts to be careful</p>
<p>in this crazy world we live in. <br />1. Tip from Tae Kwon Do : <br />The elbow is the strongest point <br />on your body. <br />If you are close enough to use it, do! <br />2.. Learned this from a tourist guide. <br />If a robber asks for your wallet and/or purse, <br />DO NOT HAND IT TO HIM. <br />Toss it away from you.... <br />Chances are that he is more interested <br />in your wallet and/or purse than you, and he will gofor the wallet/purse. <br />RUN LIKE MAD IN THE OTHER DIRECTION! </p>
<p>3. If you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car, <br />kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy...... <br />The driver won't see you, but everybody else will. <br />This has saved lives. <br />4. Women have a tendency to get into their cars <br />after shopping, eating, working, etc., and just sit <br />(doing their chequebook, or making a list, etc.) <br />DON'T DO THIS! <br />The predator will be watching you, and this is the perfect opportunity forhim to get in on the passenger side, put a gun to your head, and tell youwhere to go. <br />AS SOON AS YOU GET INTO YOUR CAR , <br />LOCK THE DOORS AND LEAVE... </p>
<p>If someone is in the car <br />with a gun to your head <br />DO NOT DRIVE OFF, <br />Repeat: <br />DO NOT DRIVE OFF! <br />INSTEAD gun the engine ! <br />and speed into anything, wrecking the car. <br />Your <acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym Bag will save you. <br />If the person is in the back seat <br />they will get the worst of it ! </acronym></p>
<p>As soon as the car crashes <br />bail out and run. <br />It is better than having them find your body in a remote location. </p>
<p>5. A few notes about getting <br />into your car in a parking lot, <br />or parking garage: <br />A.) Be aware: <br />look around you, <br />look into your car, <br />at the passenger side floor , <br />and in the back seat <br />B.) If you are parked next to a big van, <br />enter your car from the passenger door. <br />Most serial killers attack their victims <br />by pulling them into their vans while the women <br />are attempting to get into their cars. <br />C.) Look at the car <br />parked on the driver's side of your vehicle, <br />and the passenger side... If a male is sitting alone <br />in the seat nearest your car, you may want to walk back <br />into the mall, or work, and get a <br />guard/policeman to walk you back out. <br />IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY. (And better paranoid than dead.) </p>
<p>6. ALWAYS take the elevator <br />instead of the stairs. <br />Stairwells are horrible places to be alone <br />and the perfect crime spot. <br />This is especially true at NIGHT!</p>
<p>7. If the predator has a gun <br />and you are not under his control, <br />ALWAYS RUN! <br />The predator will only hit you (a running target) <br />4 in 100 times; and even then, <br />it most likely WILL NOT be a vital organ. <br />RUN, Preferably in a zig -zag pattern! <br />8. As women, we are always trying <br />to be sympathetic: <br />STOP <br />It may get you raped, or killed. <br />Ted Bundy,well educated man, who ALWAYS played <br />on the sympathies of unsuspecting women. <br />He walked with a cane, or a limp, and often <br />asked 'for help' into his vehicle or with his vehicle, <br />which is when he abducted <br />his next victim. </p>
<p>9. Another Safety Point: <br />Someone just told me that her friend heard <br />a crying baby on her porch the night before last, <br />and she called the police because it was late <br />and she thought it was weird.. The police told her <br />'Whatever you do, DO NOT <br />open the door..' <br />The lady then said that it sounded like the baby <br />had crawled near a window, and she was worried <br />that it would crawl to the street and get run over. <br />The policeman said, 'We already have a unit on the way, <br />whatever you do, DO NOT open the door.' <br />He told her that they think a serial killer <br />has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax <br />women out of their homes thinking that someone <br />dropped off a baby. He said they have not verified it, <br />but have had several calls by women saying that <br />they hear baby's cries outside their doors <br />when they're home alone at night. </p>
<p>10. Water scam! <br />If you wake up in the middle<br />of the night to hear all your taps outside running or what you think is a burst pipe, DO NOT GO OUT TO INVESTIGATE! These people turn on all your outside taps full ball so that you will go out to investigate and<br />then attack.</p>

<blockquote><p>  I would like to know whether we can start a PVSP Historcial blog.</p>
<p>  Lot of scholars and researchers are there in this forum. This mailing list/yahoo group serves it purpose. But thinking about the peruvizha souvenir , lot of members specifically wrote articles for it .</p>
<p>  Stating a PVSP Blog and members contributing essays or articles to it ona regular basis, say once in a month - would encourage people to write as well as be storage house of lot of information .</p>
<p>  Writing in Blog format would allow the main essay to be seprate and responses/comments to be separate. Unlike yahoo groups the topics wont get diverted and more focus can be given on the topic.</p>
<p>  I own a theme based blog(Tamil Literature) - but I come across lot of information on History (which is not suitable for Tamil Lit blog) but can be contributed so that the knowledge gets shared. I also know how much wealth of info people like VJ have but cant contribute in their blog since their blog is also based on some theme.</p>
<p>  Either this can be made as a blog or PVSP online magazine which releases every month or some specific period.</p>
<p>  I guess Thiru is testing or using Yahoo group blogs already.</p>
<p>  Taking such a step would encourage all the group members to regularly write and also we can have easily searchable pages with valid infomation(its difficult to search articles in yahoo groups).</p>
<p>  SPS and other Group Moderators,senior members please consider this.</p>

          DOs &amp; DONTs in AN EMERGENCY        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Pls create more awareness :: </p>
<p>FROM A POLICE OFFICER / FORWARD MESSAGE ::</p>
<p>Someone just told me that her friend heard <br />a crying baby on her porch the night before last, <br />and she called the police because it was late <br />and she thought it was weird.. <br />The police told her <br />'Whatever you do, DO NOT <br />open the door..' <br />The lady then said that it sounded like the baby <br />had crawled near a window, and she was worried <br />that it would crawl to the street and get run over. <br />The policeman said, 'We already have a unit on the way, <br />whatever you do, DO NOT open the door.' <br />He told her that they think a serial killer <br />has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax <br />women out of their homes thinking that someone <br />dropped off a baby. He said they have not verified it, <br />but have had several calls by women saying that <br />they hear baby's cries outside their doors <br />when they're home alone at night. <br />=================</p>
<p>Because of recent abductions <br />In daylight hours, refresh yourself <br />of these things to do in an emergency </p>
<p>situation... <br />This is for you, and for you to share <br />with your wife, your children, <br />everyone you know. <br />After reading these 9 crucial tips, <br />forward them to someone you care about. <br />It never hurts to be careful</p>
<p>in this crazy world we live in. <br />1. Tip from Tae Kwon Do : <br />The elbow is the strongest point <br />on your body. <br />If you are close enough to use it, do! <br />2.. Learned this from a tourist guide. <br />If a robber asks for your wallet and/or purse, <br />DO NOT HAND IT TO HIM. <br />Toss it away from you.... <br />Chances are that he is more interested <br />in your wallet and/or purse than you, and he will gofor the wallet/purse. <br />RUN LIKE MAD IN THE OTHER DIRECTION! </p>
<p>3. If you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car, <br />kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy...... <br />The driver won't see you, but everybody else will. <br />This has saved lives. <br />4. Women have a tendency to get into their cars <br />after shopping, eating, working, etc., and just sit <br />(doing their chequebook, or making a list, etc.) <br />DON'T DO THIS! <br />The predator will be watching you, and this is the perfect opportunity forhim to get in on the passenger side, put a gun to your head, and tell youwhere to go. <br />AS SOON AS YOU GET INTO YOUR CAR , <br />LOCK THE DOORS AND LEAVE... </p>
<p>If someone is in the car <br />with a gun to your head <br />DO NOT DRIVE OFF, <br />Repeat: <br />DO NOT DRIVE OFF! <br />INSTEAD gun the engine ! <br />and speed into anything, wrecking the car. <br />Your <acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym Bag will save you. <br />If the person is in the back seat <br />they will get the worst of it ! </acronym></p>
<p>As soon as the car crashes <br />bail out and run. <br />It is better than having them find your body in a remote location. </p>
<p>5. A few notes about getting <br />into your car in a parking lot, <br />or parking garage: <br />A.) Be aware: <br />look around you, <br />look into your car, <br />at the passenger side floor , <br />and in the back seat <br />B.) If you are parked next to a big van, <br />enter your car from the passenger door. <br />Most serial killers attack their victims <br />by pulling them into their vans while the women <br />are attempting to get into their cars. <br />C.) Look at the car <br />parked on the driver's side of your vehicle, <br />and the passenger side... If a male is sitting alone <br />in the seat nearest your car, you may want to walk back <br />into the mall, or work, and get a <br />guard/policeman to walk you back out. <br />IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY. (And better paranoid than dead.) </p>
<p>6. ALWAYS take the elevator <br />instead of the stairs. <br />Stairwells are horrible places to be alone <br />and the perfect crime spot. <br />This is especially true at NIGHT!</p>
<p>7. If the predator has a gun <br />and you are not under his control, <br />ALWAYS RUN! <br />The predator will only hit you (a running target) <br />4 in 100 times; and even then, <br />it most likely WILL NOT be a vital organ. <br />RUN, Preferably in a zig -zag pattern! <br />8. As women, we are always trying <br />to be sympathetic: <br />STOP <br />It may get you raped, or killed. <br />Ted Bundy,well educated man, who ALWAYS played <br />on the sympathies of unsuspecting women. <br />He walked with a cane, or a limp, and often <br />asked 'for help' into his vehicle or with his vehicle, <br />which is when he abducted <br />his next victim. </p>
<p>9. Another Safety Point: <br />Someone just told me that her friend heard <br />a crying baby on her porch the night before last, <br />and she called the police because it was late <br />and she thought it was weird.. The police told her <br />'Whatever you do, DO NOT <br />open the door..' <br />The lady then said that it sounded like the baby <br />had crawled near a window, and she was worried <br />that it would crawl to the street and get run over. <br />The policeman said, 'We already have a unit on the way, <br />whatever you do, DO NOT open the door.' <br />He told her that they think a serial killer <br />has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax <br />women out of their homes thinking that someone <br />dropped off a baby. He said they have not verified it, <br />but have had several calls by women saying that <br />they hear baby's cries outside their doors <br />when they're home alone at night. </p>
<p>10. Water scam! <br />If you wake up in the middle<br />of the night to hear all your taps outside running or what you think is a burst pipe, DO NOT GO OUT TO INVESTIGATE! These people turn on all your outside taps full ball so that you will go out to investigate and<br />then attack.</p>

<blockquote><p>  I would like to know whether we can start a PVSP Historcial blog.</p>
<p>  Lot of scholars and researchers are there in this forum. This mailing list/yahoo group serves it purpose. But thinking about the peruvizha souvenir , lot of members specifically wrote articles for it .</p>
<p>  Stating a PVSP Blog and members contributing essays or articles to it ona regular basis, say once in a month - would encourage people to write as well as be storage house of lot of information .</p>
<p>  Writing in Blog format would allow the main essay to be seprate and responses/comments to be separate. Unlike yahoo groups the topics wont get diverted and more focus can be given on the topic.</p>
<p>  I own a theme based blog(Tamil Literature) - but I come across lot of information on History (which is not suitable for Tamil Lit blog) but can be contributed so that the knowledge gets shared. I also know how much wealth of info people like VJ have but cant contribute in their blog since their blog is also based on some theme.</p>
<p>  Either this can be made as a blog or PVSP online magazine which releases every month or some specific period.</p>
<p>  I guess Thiru is testing or using Yahoo group blogs already.</p>
<p>  Taking such a step would encourage all the group members to regularly write and also we can have easily searchable pages with valid infomation(its difficult to search articles in yahoo groups).</p>
<p>  SPS and other Group Moderators,senior members please consider this.</p>
