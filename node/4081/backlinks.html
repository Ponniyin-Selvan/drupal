<blockquote><p>  thanks for many compliments. what do you, as a public and tax payer, <br />  expect from asi? psot comments dear members <br />  sriraman.p.s.</p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Dear all</p>
<p>Mr.Sriraman is asking for all of our opinion in terms of what we<br />expect out of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym . He is asking for our suggestions, feedback. I think<br />it is a very good opportunity to share our expectations with him. I am<br />sure he will convey all of our feedbacks to the Supt. Archaeologist<br />Mrs.Sathyabhama and do the needful.</acronym></p>
<p>I'd like to list the following:</p>
<p>* Would it be possible for <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  to conduct a public display of items<br />after each major excavation (Not necessarily with all the actual<br />assets at all times - may be with photos). I think few have happened<br />in the past but we are not aware of it. We can start off with<br />Adhichchanallur and Mahamallapuram excavations of the last 2 years<br />which yielded valuable assets.</acronym></p>
<p>* Would it be possible to bring out a list of books published by<br /><acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym -South Zone with decent photos on the web ? Again, something exists<br />already but not very attractive. Anything related to "web" all govt<br />agencies need to go to NIC I believe.</acronym></p>
<p>Other feedbacks welcome</p>
<p>Thanks<br />Gokul.S</p>

        <p>Sorry to intervene. I have stopped replying to such issues as I have learnt<br />to live in a co-existing way becoz friends turn foe for no mistake of mine.<br />But after reading things going on, I would only say one thing- and request<br />members not to continue for my reply as a thread. I agree fully with<br />Mr.Sriraman. I have been fortunate to move closely with the greats like<br />Dr.T.Satyamurthy, thanks to our temple revival organisation the<br />R.E.A.C.HFoundation which was successfully registered and plans are<br />afoot to rebuild<br />the Uthiramerur Kailasanatha temple. He is one man with so much knowledge<br />and experience, but has the greatest virtue of remaining aploitical when<br />adversities or unsavoury comments come forth. He just clears technical<br />doubts, when asked for. HE replies with correct documentation and theroy<br />when a detail is dealt with. That's the sign of a true historian. Also, when<br />help is needed to estimate the expenses for any reconstruction of a temple,<br />or to read a stone scripture, he immediately sends his ex-<acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  friends or<br />collegues to complete the task. I was also thinking it would benefit guys if<br />we send them to varalaaru.com. Later when I found that only few want to own<br />articles as well as history (lol) and in that process, also the name they<br />could get along with (varalaaru.com), I resisted myself doing so. Sorry to<br />say this members. True history is lying somewhere. We need to be a learner<br />and an observer than become authoritarians. This is for the sake of<br />honouring true historians and not to create a blemish to their work done, so<br />far; Let us learn facts of history.I am sure, except a few in our group<br />(countable) most are novices in history.<br />No intention of insulting members of varalaaru. If they wish to stop<br />contacting me for any help I would render, it is their choice. I am what I<br />am, ready to help anyone, registration procedures, running around to<br />organise things, meetings, for arranging temple visits, take snaps or write<br />on the visits etc, and to hold a BIG BOWL TO BEG ( no shame on that) for<br />REACH foundation to rebuild temples.<br />Thanks for your valuable time.<br />Chandrasekaran (plasticschandra)</acronym></p>
<p>=====<br />People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't<br />believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people<br />who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find<br />them, make them.<br />- George Bernard Shaw<br />==============================</p>

<p>      hi and to kamal</p>
<p>      my reactions</p>
<p>      1.	Stating that a study about the past ? represented in <br />form <br />      like artefacts, monuments, inscription etc., etc., - is <br />complete <br />  is <br />      absurd. Finding new facts, new interpretation adds charm and <br />  keeps <br />      the interest alive in subject like history. The statement that <br />  your <br />      team is confident that the monuments studied have been <br />understood <br />    in <br />      totality is something can not be accepted. A study should pose <br />  more <br />      problems than solves it. Past is like wine and women. It <br />    intoxicates <br />      you more when it becomes older. The research activities at ASI <br />  will <br />      continue forever. In fact, when ASI was formed in 1860's then <br />the <br />      British government that a decade is sufficient to understand <br />and <br />      document Indian monumental heritage. What an underestimate? <br />    Possibly <br />      they did not complete the work that is why there was still an <br />      opportunity at Tiruvalanjuli.  <br />      2.	The controversy like the instance quoted by you is <br />very <br />      common. Are your team didn't hide any thing? Or escape away <br />from <br />      some statement uttered incidentally a la makutagama? To err is <br />      human. To hide from error is mundane. To accept the error is <br />      humility. One should choose. Anecdotes are there that even <br />giants <br />      have erred. Great people correct themselves immediately. The <br />    mundane <br />      argue incessantly. ASI as an institution should not be <br />pointed <br />  at <br />      for issues raised by individuals, even though they belonged to <br />  that <br />      institution.<br />      3.	The academics of ASI always published in one way or <br />other <br />      the fundamental aspects of their research immediately in the <br />      academic fora. The publication of significant results as news <br />  item <br />      is also a part of this endeavour that we need to reach those <br />      interested persons like you who do not have time and access to <br />      academic fora. Such information is quite sufficient for <br />      interpretation. But the crux of the issue with the other <br />  academics <br />      is that they need the comprehensive information so that the <br />  context <br />      with which the discoveries have been made could be verified.  <br />      4.	This is being attended to. Mainly problem arise from <br />the <br />      public themselves. They want us to substantiate the stories <br />they <br />      hear about the monuments. Then the language. We had to keep <br />the <br />      information in three languages. The board becomes so large it <br />      irritates the connoisseurs. They in turn complain. Then the <br />      simplicity of language. In my experience, writing a 100 word <br />note <br />    on <br />      Five rathas is the most difficult task than writing a book on <br />      Tiruvalanjuli. But 100 word note will be read by lakhs. 100 <br />page <br />      book will not be even read by 10.That is the paradox. <br />      5.	The fund utilisation, in general, is much better in <br />ASI. And <br />      the spending is just and honest and spent for the purpose it <br />is <br />      meant for.  <br />      6.	Applying a fine stucco layer over the old worn out <br />stucco <br />      cover is an accepted conservation measure and is a <br />traditional, <br />    time <br />      tested method. Every conservation decision is taken in ASI <br />after <br />  a <br />      comprehensive analysis of problems on hand. Conserve and <br />Preserve <br />      has different meanings. Going to detail will lengthen the <br />reply.  <br />      7.	Which organisation is bereft of politics? Politics <br />in its <br />      many avatars exists everywhere. Few individuals keep them <br />away. <br />    Some <br />      tend to live by it. The new dame, so well paid, IT <br />organisations <br />    too <br />      has politics at all levels. Politics exists even in family!!! <br />It <br />  is <br />      a common human malaise like cold. Live with it. The <br />consequences <br />    for <br />      people in government get is getting punished/criticised, <br />because <br />      they are paid with the public money. In private organisation, <br />you <br />      simply quit and still employed in a higher grade and pay in <br />the <br />      competitor firm.   <br />      8.	The entire financial and human resource of India, if <br />not <br />      more, is required to preserve India's heritage. How many of us <br />  are <br />      ready to share the burden? To how many ECONOMISTS preserving <br />the <br />      heritage is an indicator of growth? Rajaraja mobilised his <br />every <br />      resource to create a great edifice. How much of our resources <br />are <br />      spent on preserving them? Individually, those, who are <br />committed, <br />      spend our resources, mainly time, to the maximum. Had we not <br />  spent <br />      that much time in sharing our knowledge with persons? In a <br />state <br />      where there is severe resource crunch, heritage is given the <br />  least <br />      priority. <br />      9.	Institutions are made up of individuals. If <br />individuals are <br />      good, the institutions are good. Malaise is there everywhere. <br />  They <br />      need to be cured. Not publicised.<br />      regards<br />      sriraman.p.s.</p>

Great people correct themselves immediately. The <br />  mundane <br />    argue incessantly. ASI as an institution should not be pointed <br />at <br />    for issues raised by individuals, even though they belonged to <br />that <br />    institution.<br />    3.	The academics of ASI always published in one way or other <br />    the fundamental aspects of their research immediately in the <br />    academic fora. The publication of significant results as news <br />item <br />    is also a part of this endeavour that we need to reach those <br />    interested persons like you who do not have time and access to <br />    academic fora. Such information is quite sufficient for <br />    interpretation. But the crux of the issue with the other <br />academics <br />    is that they need the comprehensive information so that the <br />context <br />    with which the discoveries have been made could be verified.  <br />    4.	This is being attended to. Mainly problem arise from the <br />    public themselves. They want us to substantiate the stories they <br />    hear about the monuments. Then the language. We had to keep the <br />    information in three languages. The board becomes so large it <br />    irritates the connoisseurs. They in turn complain. Then the <br />    simplicity of language. In my experience, writing a 100 word note <br />  on <br />    Five rathas is the most difficult task than writing a book on <br />    Tiruvalanjuli. But 100 word note will be read by lakhs. 100 page <br />    book will not be even read by 10.That is the paradox. <br />    5.	The fund utilisation, in general, is much better in ASI. And <br />    the spending is just and honest and spent for the purpose it is <br />    meant for.  <br />    6.	Applying a fine stucco layer over the old worn out stucco <br />    cover is an accepted conservation measure and is a traditional, <br />  time <br />    tested method. Every conservation decision is taken in ASI after <br />a <br />    comprehensive analysis of problems on hand. Conserve and Preserve <br />    has different meanings. Going to detail will lengthen the reply.  <br />    7.	Which organisation is bereft of politics? Politics in its <br />    many avatars exists everywhere. Few individuals keep them away. <br />  Some <br />    tend to live by it. The new dame, so well paid, IT organisations <br />  too <br />    has politics at all levels. Politics exists even in family!!! It <br />is <br />    a common human malaise like cold. Live with it. The consequences <br />  for <br />    people in government get is getting punished/criticised, because <br />    they are paid with the public money. In private organisation, you <br />    simply quit and still employed in a higher grade and pay in the <br />    competitor firm.   <br />    8.	The entire financial and human resource of India, if not <br />    more, is required to preserve India's heritage. How many of us <br />are <br />    ready to share the burden? To how many ECONOMISTS preserving the <br />    heritage is an indicator of growth? Rajaraja mobilised his every <br />    resource to create a great edifice. How much of our resources are <br />    spent on preserving them? Individually, those, who are committed, <br />    spend our resources, mainly time, to the maximum. Had we not <br />spent <br />    that much time in sharing our knowledge with persons? In a state <br />    where there is severe resource crunch, heritage is given the <br />least <br />    priority. <br />    9.	Institutions are made up of individuals. If individuals are <br />    good, the institutions are good. Malaise is there everywhere. <br />They <br />    need to be cured.

        <p>Hi</p>
<p>Know what is the easiest title to obtain.- HISTORIAN<br />anybody can go about , climb a few temples, take a few photographs, <br />read a few inscriptions all in a couple of years and claim to be a <br />complete historian.</p>
<p>then you can write articles, give opinions, challenge career <br />historians who have spent a lifetime on these issues and generally <br />go about saying everybody else is wrong . only we are right.</p>
<p>TRY DOING this in physics or chemistry. you cant. for everything <br />there is a verifiable commodity or issue. you cant even do it in <br />geography. you can get away with it in history only and quite some <br />people seem to know it well.</p>
<p>and Fault finding of recent is the biggest thing that can get <br />somebody some publicity.<br />when a general press article comes about some historical discovery a <br />hastily constructed article appears in Varalaaru.com saying that <br />discovery is false.<br />the time gap between the two is so less that we can see people have <br />not paused even to think.or visit the place for a re-look. thats <br />mainly because of the know all attitude.<br />but of recent these type of articles have given varalaaru.com such a <br />negative outlook. like the sole crusader out to disprove everything.<br />I only hope articles dont appear in aananda vikadan about MGR samadhi <br />or Anna Samathi for varalaaru .com is sure to comment even on their <br />authenticity.<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  my reactions</p>
<p>  1.	Stating that a study about the past ? represented in form <br />  like artefacts, monuments, inscription etc., etc., - is complete is <br />  absurd. Finding new facts, new interpretation adds charm and keeps <br />  the interest alive in subject like history. The statement that your <br />  team is confident that the monuments studied have been understood <br />in <br />  totality is something can not be accepted. A study should pose more <br />  problems than solves it. Past is like wine and women. It <br />intoxicates <br />  you more when it becomes older. The research activities at ASI will <br />  continue forever. In fact, when ASI was formed in 1860's then the <br />  British government that a decade is sufficient to understand and <br />  document Indian monumental heritage. What an underestimate? <br />Possibly <br />  they did not complete the work that is why there was still an <br />  opportunity at Tiruvalanjuli.  <br />  2.

        <p>Dear Vidya,</p>
<p>Good points. It clearly states the expectations from<br /><acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym .</p>
<p>Dear Sriraman,</p>
<p>It is true and nobody can deny that the efforts of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym <br />put towards preservation is remarkable. Initiatives<br />like Interpretation center are need of the hour. When<br />we visited it during my last trip to india, I was<br />telling Ram that <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  deserves a special appreciation.</p>
<p>I appreciate your intentions to know the feedback from<br />public. I am putting the below comments as a person<br />interested in history and have some interactions with<br /><acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  and State archeology department.</p>
<p>1. Completeness</p>
<p>I request <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym /State arch. dept. to do the work<br />completely. When an excavation or temple study is<br />started, please try to complete all aspects like<br />architecture, inscriptions, iconography, etc. We see<br />many temples which were partly researched and history<br />was written based on those partial findings. Some<br />examples we can quote from our field work experience<br />are Thiruvalanjuzhi and Udayaloor.</acronym></p>
<p>2. Controversies</p>
<p>Some of the conclusions arrived on recent excavations<br />created some controversies among the historians. For<br />example, Dr.Sathiyamurthy said there are some old<br />brahmi scripts inside the urn excavated from<br />Adhichanallur. But Dr.Sathiyabhama said those are not<br />letters at all. This surfaced out when Iravatham<br />Mahadevan raised some questions during the conference<br />held in Tamil university couple of months ago. In the<br />same conference, Dr.Nadana Kasinathan (former State<br />arch. dept director) said he was not allowed to see<br />that urn. Such controversies could have been avoided<br />if brahmi experts were consulted before publishing the<br />news.</p>
<p>3. Timeliness</p>
<p>As Vidya pointed out in her mail, it is very important<br />to give complete information at right time. Still a<br />fullstop is pending for many issues like dating of<br />Adhichanallur urn, scripts inside the urn, date of<br />temple excavated near pulikkugai, etc. Unless the<br />complete information is given as soon as the<br />excavation is completed, it is difficult to filter<br />history out of it.</p>
<p>4. Monuments</p>
<p>As Satish stated in a feedback to one of varalaaru.com<br />articles, very few monuments have explanations about<br />the historical importance of monuments. Only the<br />caution board mentioning the law sections under which<br />this monument is protected are no use for public. In<br />those very few monuments also, information provided<br />were proved to be wrong in later days. It is very<br />important to update them and give right information to<br />public. The best examples are the boards kept at the<br />entrance of Five rathas and Big temple.</p>
<p>5. Fund utilisation</p>
<p>We heard that some years ago, funds allocated to State<br />arch. dept. by tamilnadu government for publishing the<br />research articles were returned back to the government<br />without publishing anything and government reduced the<br />amount after that. If such funds were utilised<br />properly and atleast 1 book was brought out, history<br />lovers would have been happy. Hope the samething is<br />not happening with <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym .</p>
<p>6. Renovations</p>
<p>I dont know the reason why stucco is pasted over the<br />sculptures during renovations. It was very painful<br />when we saw Gangai konda cholapuram sculptures after<br />renovation by <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym . Entire vimanam and all sculptures<br />were covered with stucco and pink color paint. The<br />original beauty is lost. When we compared with old<br />photographs, the features also had changed a lot. Such<br />modified versions will definitely cause confusions<br />during the temple studies. Samething happened in<br />Kanchipuram Kailasanathar temple vimaanam and<br />Srinivasanallur Kurakkanathar temple also. In these 2<br />temples, only sculptures in ground floor are left as<br />it is. The temple Mahendravarmeswaram inside the<br />Kanchi kailasanathar complex is completely<br />restructured with stucco. Why such activities are<br />engaged?</acronym></p>
<p>7. Politics</p>
<p>I am not sure if this problem is easily resolvable. In<br />a way, what Satish said in his mail is true. Politics<br />is one of the obstacles in the path of <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym . It is not<br />by politicians. But because of the internal politics<br />between officers. In the past 3 years, we have<br />witnessed many events related to the coldwar between<br /><acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  and State archeology department as well as within<br /><acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  employees. I dont want to mention the names and<br />events elobarately since i am sure you are well aware<br />of such politics. But definitely this reduces the<br />productivity and a barrier to publish the findings.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>8. Commission</p>
<p>Many people (we also used to) think that <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  employees<br />have less scope for putting money into their pockets<br />in illegal ways. But some recent incidents and<br />information from related people made us to think that<br />it is no lesser than a taluk office or road contractor<br />business. Sometimes ago, we were shocked hearing that<br />most of the officers in the hierarchy get a percentage<br />from the fund alloted for maintenance/renovation of<br />each monument. What is the point in blaming<br />politicians alone?</acronym></p>
<p>9. New undertakings</p>
<p>Heard that <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  has stopped undertaking new monuments.<br />I dont know the reason behind such decision. The<br />ultimate result will reflect on monuments only. If <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym <br />is not undertaking, who else will have interest to<br />save them? Many more monuments will be added to the<br />list of Malaiyadikkurichi, Thiruppattur Kailasanathar,<br />etc. Dr.Kalaikkovan is trying for past several years<br />to make this Kailasanathar temple as a protected<br />monument. But no luck so far. Fortunately, Pullamangai<br />was protected after the joint effort by Dr.Kalaikkovan<br />and Dr.Kudavoil Balu.</acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Hope you will take all these comments positively and<br />request you to let the group know how these points are<br />addressed by <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym .</p>
<p>Thanks<br />Kamal</p>

<p>    Dear all</p>
<p>    Mr.Sriraman is asking for all of our opinion in<br />  terms of what we<br />    expect out of ASI. He is asking for our<br />  suggestions, feedback. I <br />  think<br />    it is a very good opportunity to share our<br />  expectations with him. <br />  I am<br />    sure he will convey all of our feedbacks to the<br />  Supt. Archaeologist<br />    Mrs.Sathyabhama and do the needful.</p>
<p>    I'd like to list the following:</p>
<p>    * Would it be possible for ASI to conduct a public<br />  display of items<br />    after each major excavation (Not necessarily with<br />  all the actual<br />    assets at all times - may be with photos). I think<br />  few have <br />  happened<br />    in the past but we are not aware of it. We can<br />  start off with<br />    Adhichchanallur and Mahamallapuram excavations of<br />  the last 2 years<br />    which yielded valuable assets.</p>
<p>    * Would it be possible to bring out a list of<br />  books published by<br />    ASI-South Zone with decent photos on the web ?<br />  Again, something <br />  exists<br />    already but not very attractive. Anything related<br />  to "web" all govt<br />    agencies need to go to NIC I believe.</p>
<p>    Other feedbacks welcome</p>

        <p>Hi<br />I guess a lot of studies and finds were grossly repetitive.<br />say if some one finds a pot full of similar chola coins- say a <br />thousand of them we cant do justice to all. I feel <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  is in that <br />trap. new technology and better personnel are making wonders in new <br />finds. its wrong on our part to waste their man housr in printing and <br />sorting out what their predecessors have done.
