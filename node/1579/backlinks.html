</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear all<br />That was a very interesting veiw point but I agree with Krupa that there is no research evidence to point in that direction.....</p>
<p>Just because the chola architechture is different doesnt mean that they are from outside....</p>
<p>The temples that preceed chola temples are mamalapuram temples and they have similar architechture....ie the structure of praharam being tall....</p>
<p>the chola temples had big main praharams and small rajagopurams on the contrary to the rest which had big rajagopurams....</p>
<p>the chola style of temples then had their influence on the chalukya and ganga temples...</p>
<p>As far as the names are concerned I think like krups said Arulmozhi and aadithan and kanadirathithan were chaste tamil names...</p>
<p>secondly there was a timescale difference of 800 years between the<br />two sagas and there will be influence of other lingiustic and cultural trends Are the greek names of today sounding like aristotile and plato or the names of italians sounding like julius and augustus....does that mean they are different people ....we know they are not but its just influence of other cultures and effect of time</p>
<p>any veiws</p>

        <p>Dear Sridhar Rathinam,<br />It is clear that we have some intriguing evidence here which does not tally with our preconceived notions of cola history.That 'this particular Vanavanmadevi"is none other than <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's mother is clear from the inscription itself which refers to her as the doe which gave birth to a tiger cub.Since no other infant of this lady is known to have existed one is led to conclude that the infant in question was probably <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  himself even tho this may militate against the <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  vrsion whose historical veracity is open to question.<br />Kari was known to have killed Ori and given Kolli hill to the Cera king.<br />GR</acronym></p>

<p>This particular vanavan madhevi has been discussed in this forum before...and the querry was who was the baby she was suckling,#</p>
<p>some one even offered an example and said the chola citizens and the nation was the child she was suckling...</p>
<p>even kalki mentions about kapilar saving the kari's children from was it pari or ori saying how can you kill the two children</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi all, <br />  Today I came across an article by R.Nagaswamy on<br />  Sangam poetic traditions under the imperial Colas<br />  which throws some light on the connection of<br />  Rajaraja Cola to personages of the sangam age thro<br />  his mother, Vaanavanmadevi.This refers to an<br />  inscription dated 1012 C.E.(27th regnal year)found<br />  in the Virattanesvara temple of Tirukkoyilur.It<br />  deals ith the gift of villages to this temple<br />  ordered by RR at the request of one Kampan<br />  Vithivitankan.It is a long poem in Aciriyappa meter<br />  running to over 230 lines in the aarruppatai<br />  format.RR's conquests of<br />  Pandya,Cera,Gangapadi,Udagamandalam,Kongam and<br />  Ilamandalam are mentioned.It mentions the<br />  poet,Kapilar, and the marriage of Pai's daughter to<br />  Malaiyaman.It says that Kapilar, having ensured the<br />  safety of Pari's daughter, immolated himself on a<br />  boulder on the river Pennai near the Virattana<br />  temple.The record also mentions that RR's mother was<br />  born in the family of Malaiyaman on her father's<br />  sideand Pari on her mother's side and immolated<br />  herself on the funeral pyre of her husband,leaving<br />  behind an infant whom she was suckling.<br />  To me this appears to be the one concrete evidence<br />  giving the ties of RR with the kings of the sangam<br />  age thro his mother.<br />  GR</p>

<p>    I did ask Kudavoil Dr. Balu whether Imperial<br />  Chozhas<br />    are outsiders. <br />    He replied that all the Kings had matrimonial<br />    alliances with other <br />    Kings of other regions including Rastrakoot,<br />    Chalukyas, Pallavas &amp; <br />    all.. - who in turn had alliances with Aryas.

<p>    When we were passing by Thirukkandiyur, he<br />  mentioned<br />    that the place <br />    was a muslim settlement even before 1311 AD (Mkfr<br />    invasions!). When <br />    Mkfr invaded, they surrendered and sought<br />  previleges<br />    in the name of <br />    their religion. Mkfr refused to consider them at<br />  par<br />    but pardoned <br />    them because they were Non-Hindus. How come a<br />  Muslim<br />    settlement <br />    before Mohammeden invasion? Arab Traders stayed /<br />    overstayed and <br />    fertiled locals ...

<p>    It was implied that Mkfr &amp; Co., was considered<br />    outsiders, but <br />    Tkndyr Muslims were not! or vice-versa... like<br />  Mkfr<br />    did not consider <br />    Tkndyr Muslims as his people!</p>

<p>This particular vanavan madhevi has been discussed in this forum before...and the querry was who was the baby she was suckling,#</p>
<p>some one even offered an example and said the chola citizens and the nation was the child she was suckling...</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi all, <br />  Today I came across an article by R.Nagaswamy on<br />  Sangam poetic traditions under the imperial Colas<br />  which throws some light on the connection of<br />  Rajaraja Cola to personages of the sangam age thro<br />  his mother, Vaanavanmadevi.This refers to an<br />  inscription dated 1012 C.E.(27th regnal year)found<br />  in the Virattanesvara temple of Tirukkoyilur.It<br />  deals ith the gift of villages to this temple<br />  ordered by RR at the request of one Kampan<br />  Vithivitankan.It is a long poem in Aciriyappa meter<br />  running to over 230 lines in the aarruppatai<br />  format.RR's conquests of<br />  Pandya,Cera,Gangapadi,Udagamandalam,Kongam and<br />  Ilamandalam are mentioned.It mentions the<br />  poet,Kapilar, and the marriage of Pai's daughter to<br />  Malaiyaman.It says that Kapilar, having ensured the<br />  safety of Pari's daughter, immolated himself on a<br />  boulder on the river Pennai near the Virattana<br />  temple.The record also mentions that RR's mother was<br />  born in the family of Malaiyaman on her father's<br />  sideand Pari on her mother's side and immolated<br />  herself on the funeral pyre of her husband,leaving<br />  behind an infant whom she was suckling.<br />  To me this appears to be the one concrete evidence<br />  giving the ties of RR with the kings of the sangam<br />  age thro his mother.<br />  GR</p>

Mkfr refused to consider them at<br />  par<br />    but pardoned <br />    them because they were Non-Hindus. How come a<br />  Muslim<br />    settlement <br />    before Mohammeden invasion?

        <p>Hi all, <br />Today I came across an article by R.Nagaswamy on Sangam poetic traditions under the imperial Colas which throws some light on the connection of Rajaraja Cola to personages of the sangam age thro his mother, Vaanavanmadevi.This refers to an inscription dated 1012 C.E.(27th regnal year)found in the Virattanesvara temple of Tirukkoyilur.It deals ith the gift of villages to this temple ordered by <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  at the request of one Kampan Vithivitankan.It is a long poem in Aciriyappa meter running to over 230 lines in the aarruppatai format.RR's conquests of<br />Pandya,Cera,Gangapadi,Udagamandalam,Kongam and Ilamandalam are mentioned.It mentions the poet,Kapilar, and the marriage of Pai's daughter to Malaiyaman.It says that Kapilar, having ensured the safety of Pari's daughter, immolated himself on a boulder on the river Pennai near the Virattana temple.The record also mentions that <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym 's mother was born in the family of Malaiyaman on her father's sideand Pari on her mother's side and immolated herself on the funeral pyre of her husband,leaving behind an infant whom she was suckling.<br />To me this appears to be the one concrete evidence giving the ties of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  with the kings of the sangam age thro his mother.<br />GR</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>

<p>I did ask Kudavoil Dr. Balu whether Imperial Chozhas are outsiders. <br />He replied that all the Kings had matrimonial alliances with other <br />Kings of other regions including Rastrakoot, Chalukyas, Pallavas &amp; <br />all.. - who in turn had alliances with Aryas. Thus the mix became <br />inevitable.. It was more on the Chozhas side because they were <br />strong and others had to reconcile with them..

<p>When we were passing by Thirukkandiyur, he mentioned that the place <br />was a muslim settlement even before 1311 AD (Mkfr invasions!). When <br />Mkfr invaded, they surrendered and sought previleges in the name of <br />their religion. Mkfr refused to consider them at par but pardoned <br />them because they were Non-Hindus.

<p>I did ask Kudavoil Dr. Balu whether Imperial Chozhas are outsiders. <br />He replied that all the Kings had matrimonial alliances with other <br />Kings of other regions including Rastrakoot, Chalukyas, Pallavas &amp; <br />all.. - who in turn had alliances with Aryas. Thus the mix became <br />inevitable.. It was more on the Chozhas side because they were <br />strong and others had to reconcile with them.. Strictly speaking in <br />their parentage, atlest one root remained from Chozhas... traced <br />from - let us say - Karikala.</p>
<p>When we were passing by Thirukkandiyur, he mentioned that the place <br />was a muslim settlement even before 1311 AD (Mkfr invasions!). When <br />Mkfr invaded, they surrendered and sought previleges in the name of <br />their religion. Mkfr refused to consider them at par but pardoned <br />them because they were Non-Hindus. How come a Muslim settlement <br />before Mohammeden invasion? Arab Traders stayed / overstayed and <br />fertiled locals ... Thus figuring of their names in Chozha and <br />Pandya inscriptions in the 10th Centuries or before! </p>
<p>It was implied that Mkfr &amp; Co., was considered outsiders, but <br />Tkndyr Muslims were not! or vice-versa... like Mkfr did not consider <br />Tkndyr Muslims as his people!</p>

        <p>Thanq for the tiruvalankadu plates.KAN who considered all the available evidence including these plates writes in his book on Colas:<br />..........the Anbil plates which give fifteen names before Vijayalaya including the genuinely historical ones of Karikala,Killi and Koccenkanan.The Tiruvalankadu plates swell the list to forty four and the Kanyakumari list runs upto fifty two, while the Leyden grant is satisfied with a dozen.There are others of varyin lengths to be gathered from literary works like the Kalingattupparani, the ulas of Ottakkuthan etc.No two of these lists agree though some names and details are common.<br />Rangarajan</p>

        <p>Dear Gokul,<br />Thank you very much for your detailed and careful responses to the questions raised by me regarding the colas.I summarize them below:<br />We have no clear idea of how things were evolved between the times of the colas of the cankam age and the imperial colas.<br />Only a few colas can be spotted from stray references in bhakthi literature during the dark ages between the 3rd and the 9th centuries A.D.<br />There is no strong basis even for this chronology.<br />The Pallavas were from Andhra and had possibly a Persian origin,even though they had become Indianised.<br />Under these circumstances to say that the imperial colas were indigeneous to the Tamil country in the same way as their counterparts of the cankam works seems unacceptable.PS can therfore not be viewed even as a semi-historic novel in spite of its excellence as a literary work.This is the point to which I have been trying to draw the attention of the members of this egroup.<br />Mikka anputan,<br />R</p>

          Are Imperial Cholas outsiders ?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Gokul,<br />Thank u for that considered reply.But I have some questions still.<br />Do we have a clear idea of how things were evolved between the times of the colas of the cankam age and the imperial colas?<br />Who are the colas who can be spotted during the socalled dark ages between the 3rd and 9th centuries A.D.?By the way what is the basis for this chronology?How did Arumoli of the inscriptions transform into Arulmolivarman or Arulmolittevar of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym ?<br />Yes,the imperial Colas seem to have been inspired by the Pallavas in temple architecture. But were the Pallavas indigeneous to Tamilnadu or were they outsiders?<br />Finally, these are not questions of one's opinion but issues which have to be addressed<br />and settled one way or the other, to the satisfaction of all concerned.<br />I would be grateful for your remarks,if you have any.Thank you for your time and attention.<br />Rangarajan</acronym></p>
<p>"S.Gokul" <seshadrigokul@yahoo.com  wrote:<br />Quite a lot of questions have been raised - but let me just post <br />few of my insights.</seshadrigokul@yahoo.com></p>
<p>* There are very significant differences between sanga kala chola <br />and later cholas. One of the most prominent one being the influence <br />of sanskrit and associated cultural mix. Hence while later cholas <br />trace back their ancestory to the sangam age, many things have <br />evolved in the period.</p>
<p>* We can spot many cholas even during the dark ages - between 3rd <br />cen and 9th cen. Hence the dynasty was alive. But we are not sure <br />who bore vijayalaya etc.</p>
<p>* Arulmozhi was indeed rajaraja's name. He is referred to as <br />Arumozhi without the "l". We recently got a record in velur <br />referring to a temple built by rajaraja before ascending the throne. <br />It is called arumozhi Iswaram.</p>
<p>* Cholas had great respect and regard for pallava art forms and <br />happily carried many of the traditions set forth by the latter. <br />Rajaraja, who constructed BIG temple refers to kanchi kailasanatha <br />temple as "Periya Katrali" !</p>
<p>In my view, cholas were not outsiders but they were absolutely open <br />to other culture and traditional infulences and let their art forms <br />enriched with all these elements.</p>

          Are Imperial Cholas outsiders ?        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply to my query.But I still am not convinced and I think this warrants a closer study.</p>
<p>Adithan is not a Tamil name.In Sanskrit it means the son of Aditi and hence given to Sun.Much less Gandaraditya! Arulmozhi,now does that name for Rajaraja figure in historical records or is it just an invention of Kalki? I also think modern Greek names do resemble the ancient ones.<br />The time difference of 800 years is based on the assumption of a chronology which, at best, is far from settled.But certainly there was a time gap and there were cultural and other influences from outside.The question is whether the imperial Colas were transmitters of some of these influences.<br />The temple architecture of Brhadeeswarar temple has an affinity to the shore temples of Mamallapuram and that again shifts the focus from the Colas to the Pallavas about whom similar questions may be raised.</p>
<p>sridhar rathinam <sridhar_rathinam@yahoo.co.uk  wrote:<br />Dear all<br />That was a very interesting veiw point but I agree with Krupa that there is no research evidence to point in that direction.....</sridhar_rathinam@yahoo.co.uk></p>
<p>Just because the chola architechture is different doesnt mean that they are from outside....</p>
<p>The temples that preceed chola temples are mamalapuram temples and they have similar architechture....ie the structure of praharam being tall....</p>
<p>the chola temples had big main praharams and small rajagopurams on the contrary to the rest which had big rajagopurams....</p>
<p>the chola style of temples then had their influence on the chalukya and ganga temples...</p>
<p>As far as the names are concerned I think like krups said Arulmozhi and aadithan and kanadirathithan were chaste tamil names...</p>
<p>secondly there was a timescale difference of 800 years between the<br />two sagas and there will be influence of other lingiustic and cultural trends Are the greek names of today sounding like aristotile and plato or the names of italians sounding like julius and augustus....does that mean they are different people ....we know they are not but its just influence of other cultures and effect of time</p>
<p>any veiws</p>
