<p>I was asked by a group of </p>
<blockquote><p>  white people if a woman in leadership roles would be acceptable in <br />  India. This is 21st century and I was surprised and very saddened <br />by <br />  the question. I told them that there are more women statistically <br />in <br />  technology in India than in US and several are in very senior <br />  positoins including CIOs. But looking at such emails I feel they <br />had <br />  a point. Yes we are not even progressed enough to condemn sati <br />  unequivocally, are we? What has sati has to do with virtue by the <br />  way? It takes more courage to live than to die and if it was indeed <br />  in the cause of love, how is it that no man died in the cause of <br />his <br />  love/wife? Or as the great Mahakavi said 'karpai podhuvil vaippom'?</p>
<p>  I really did not mean to sidetrack the thread but I just felt very <br />  sad and compelled to write. Sincere apologies.</p>

<p>    Sati is a crime regardless of whether there is 'consent' or not. <br />  (No <br />    woman in her right mind would consent to burning alive, it is not <br />    like a choice she makes to wear a white sari). </p>
<p>    donations and sponsoring various arts, temple donations etc. When <br />  we <br />    talk of status and equality specifically we have to look at <br />certain <br />    issues - were women allowed to rule officially, are the same or <br />    similar rules of marriage and family applicable to both men and <br />    women, can a common person be accepted into a royal family and so <br />  on. <br />    These questions are common across times and generations and <br />signify <br />    status of women (and men too).</p>

<p>      Wouldnt that be more of a 20th century view than a factual 10th <br />    century<br />      evidence? I mean I was wondering if there was any factual <br />account <br />    of the<br />      status enjoyed by common women of that period or before. <br />Besides <br />    like you<br />      said, royal family people, both men and women, have always had<br />      restrictions.The old vedic dharma certainly had a more equality <br />    than the<br />      post mugal period. Some one wanting to commit sati for what <br />ever <br />    reason is<br />      different from someone being forced to commit - not that I am <br />or <br />    would like<br />      to justify either.</p>
<p>      [It would be interesting to know really though if this singer's<br />      ancestor taught dance to Kundavi or was a dance teacher<br />      sponsored /supported by Kundavi, am guessing the latter sounds <br />lot<br />      more believable.]</p>
<p>      He definitely told that there is an inscription to this effect. <br />I <br />    wonder if<br />      there is a repeat of that program or if there is any other way <br />to <br />    watch it.<br />      Couldnt find it on youtube.</p>

<p>        Sandeep, am no history expert but based on Kalki's writing <br />  and <br />    very<br />        generic information - there were LOT of restrictions royal <br />  family<br />        people had, both men and women. Since we are talking about <br />  women -<br />        royal women generally were not allowed to engage in arts or <br />any <br />    other<br />        active profession, they sponsored art and artisans which is a<br />        different story altogether but being an active singer/dancer, <br />  no -<br />        remember Mahendra Pallava's extensive justification on his <br />son <br />  not<br />        marrying Sivakami as her art would then be lost to the world?</p>
<p>        Royal women were expected to be accepting of their husbands <br />  having<br />        multiple wives/concubines (unlike the Mahabharat where it <br />goes <br />    both<br />        ways!) and Sati was glorified also - even Kundavi presents <br />Sati<br />        committed by her ancestors as a great reason while declaring <br />  her <br />    love<br />        for VD? RRJ's mother herself historically committed Sati while<br />        nursing an infant.</p>
<p>        To me all this really does not add up to any great freedom. <br />  There<br />        were great women like Sembian Madhevi who used their <br />influence, <br />    money<br />        to further religious causes. But the average royal woman <br />still <br />    had to<br />        abide by all these rules. Kalki himself was a very odd mix of<br />        conservatism and progressiveness - Kalyani, Poonguzhali and <br />    Savitri<br />        on one hand with Vanavan madhevi, Vaanadhi and other husband<br />        worshipping women on the other.</p>
<p>        It would be interesting to know really though if this singer's<br />        ancestor taught dance to Kundavi or was a dance teacher<br />        sponsored /supported by Kundavi, am guessing the latter <br />sounds <br />  lot<br />        more believable.</p>

<p>          Hi Venketesh</p>
<p>          Is there anything to indicate that women were restrained <br />from<br />        certain<br />          activities those days? Were there restrictions on women of <br />  royal<br />        families<br />          from doing certain things?</p>
<p>          I am asking this more out of factual ignorance. The <br />  impression I<br />        got from<br />          Kalki's books + certain other bits &amp; accounts of westerners <br />  who <br />    had<br />          accounted the social life of those times, is that women were<br />        generally free<br />          and were not socially oppressed (as they were later on). I <br />  also<br />        felt that<br />          they were more secure then. A character like Poonkuyali <br />  travels<br />        freely where<br />          ever she pleases and women generally seem to have had a say <br />  on a<br />        lot of<br />          matters.</p>
<p>          Look forward to your knowledge (and others too) on this.</p>

        <p></p>
<blockquote><p>  Do you know there was REALLY one MEENAKSHI WHO WAS QUEEN OF MADURAI</p></blockquote>
<p>poor meenakshi literally the last ruler of madurai.<br />miserable life she had, a widow, falling in love with chanda sahib <br />and finally commited suicide when he betrayed her.<br />nice sequence in her story. asks him to swear on a cloth covered <br />koran for everlasting support to her.<br />he hides a brick under a velvet cloth and swears.</p>
<p>venketesh</p>
<p>is that there should have been a PACT between SM <br />DEVI </p>
<blockquote><p>  and SUNDARA when the latter came to the Throne in the absence of <br />  Kandraditha's desire to step down ...</p>
<p>  That should have been a Second innings (of about 15 years time-<br />frame) <br />  to Uthama when he attains Majority - or to succeed Sundara.</p>
<p>  But Aditha Karikalan II was made Yuvaraja... which should have been <br />a <br />  BREACH of that understanding..</p>
<p>  When AK II was murdered (Udayarkudi &amp; Tiruvalngadu CP confirm this, <br />as <br />  we are aware)and RRC relinquished (means he was YOUTH ENOUGH TO SIT <br />IN <br />  THE THRONE... NOT A CHILD) willingly in favour of UTHAMA.. This has <br />  happened in 971 (as I earlier quoted in 10th year of Moovenda <br />Velalan's <br />  KUMBAKONAM Nageswarankoil - Uthama's 981 Yr inscripiton)..</p>
<p>  Sembianmadevi commences her Katralis with Thirunallam @ <br />  Konerirajapuram, Vridhachalam, Thirumazhapadi etc., etc.</p>
<p>  So he should have stepped down in 985.. But we see Uthama's 16th/<br />17th <br />  year inscriptions also in thiruvarur etc ... </p>
<p>  Udayarkudi 2nd Yr of RRC (987) coincides with these years.</p>
<p>  Means RRC &amp; UTHAMA co-ruled..</p>
<p>  And in Udayarkudi RRC ascertains himself as CHAKRAVARTHI.. Means <br />  Uthama's Role / Rule ends.</p>
<p>  But SEMBIANMADEVI continues her grants even during RRC period.. <br />upto <br />  1001 AD..</p>
<p>  The last of the temples she constructed was THIRUVAKKARAI ( <br />VAKRAKALI ) <br />  CHANDRAMOULEESWARAR TEMPLE !</p>
<p>  IT is speculated that she passed away in 1001.. All the wives of <br />Uthama <br />  (about 5 I recall) made contributions in SEMBIANMADEVI - SIVA <br />TEMPLE in <br />  Nagai District.. her Birth star is CHITHIRAI month - KETTAI.. </p>
<p>  This is celebrated in a big way even now.</p>
<p>  Kudanthai Sethuraman mentioned that when she constructed <br />  Konerirajapuram - 3rd Year of Uthama - 974 AD - Kandradithar was <br />alive !</p>

        <p>-This query is a bait, dear Vijay.</p>
<p>Do you know there was REALLY one MEENAKSHI WHO WAS QUEEN OF MADURAI ?</p>
