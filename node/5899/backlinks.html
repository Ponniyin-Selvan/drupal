<p>One of the world's greatest ancient wonders, Moenjodaro, is <br />crumbling due to official callousness and corruption.</p>
<p>By Massoud Ansari</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsAug2004/expose.htm" title="http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsAug2004/expose.htm">http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsAug2004/expose.htm</a>  </p>
<p>In the wilderness of Sindh's interior, the sleepy town of Dokri is <br />home to one of the world's greatest ancientwonders: the houses, <br />granary, baths, assembly halls, towers etc that make up the fabled <br />Moenjodaro on the banks of the River Indus.</p>
<p>Today, this magnificent archaeological site is on the <br />verge of total destruction because of official apathy and corruption.</p>
<p>According to local officials, out of Moenjodaro's 370 <br />walls, nearly 150 are on the verge of collapse. Though the budget <br />allocated to preserve the country's heritage is always a pittance, <br />the reasons officials cite for this latest tragedy is the fact that <br />there are no funds at all allocated for the upkeep and maintenance <br />of one of the historical wonders of the world. "They have not <br />allocated even a single penny for the current fiscal year for <br />preserving Moenjodaro." </p>
<p>A visit to these ruins reveals the extent of damage caused <br />by the state of negligence. According to experts, the DKG area in <br />particular, needs immediate attention because recent rain-water has <br />seeped into the crevices, and damaged the majority of the structures <br />creating cracks in walls. The leaning walls are clearly visible and <br />even a layman can see that these walls will not be able to withstand <br />one more bout of the incoming monsoon rains. The rains have affected <br />other areas as well. Some portions of the stupa, as well as other <br />structures, have also been badly damaged. Given that the ground is <br />permeated with salts, archaeologists say, whenever it rains, the <br />rainwater will carry ground-salt with it, corroding everything in <br />its path. "In most cases, rains disintegrate the structures and <br />constant vigilance is needed to keep the structures intact," says an <br />official at the site.</p>
<p>Moenjodaro, also on UNESCO's list of world sites for <br />preservation, is crumbling, not only because of ignorance, but also <br />due to misappropriation of funds. Only a few years ago, fed up with <br />official corruption in Pakistan, UNESCO threatened to remove <br />Moenjodaro from its list of world heritage sites. "These world <br />bodies donate funding, but instead of spending the money for the <br />upkeep of the monuments the funds are misappropriated through <br />salaries awarded on paper to phoney consultants, or used to line the <br />pockets of local government officials and fund their inflated travel <br />allowances," says a local official in Larkana.</p>
<p>The nazim of Larkana district wrote several letters to <br />the federal government asking them to either hand over the control <br />of the upkeep of the ruins to the district government, or send <br />experts as well as funds to preserve the site from further decay. To <br />the dismay of local government officials, they found that a <br />Committee for the Preservation of Moenjodaro had already been <br />established and members were drawing huge salaries from <br />international funds allocated for the Authority for the Preservation <br />of Moenjodaro. However, all the Authority officials are based in <br />Islamabad, a 1,000 miles away from the site. "Actually some members <br />of this committee visited the site, stayed in the hotel for a couple <br />of days, had fun and disappeared," says the DCO Larkana <br />district. "They did not visit the site for any serious <br />investigation."</p>
<p>Archaeologists maintain that a minimum of five people are <br />needed for the upkeep of one section. Since the ruins are divided <br />into seven sections, a skeleton staff of 35 is required. At the <br />moment only 10 people are working on the seven areas of the site. <br />Likewise, the only engineer working on the site was transferred a <br />year ago and the authorities have yet to replace him. "It is humanly <br />impossible for 10 people to supervise such a huge area," says a site <br />official. As a result, even when visitors come to the site, <br />especially during the holidays, they walk all over the already <br />crumbling structures. Since only one-third of Moenjodaro has been <br />excavated, sometimes the rains expose unexcavated artifacts which <br />are carried away by visitors. "When they have appointed staff for a <br />committee to protect Moenjodaro, what are they doing in Islamabad? <br />Why don't they move them or their office to the site where staff is <br />badly needed?" asks Khursheed Junejo, nazim of Larkana district. </p>
<p>Official apathy can be gauged from the fact that only two <br />years ago, unknown criminals broke into the Moenjodaro museum and <br />took away 40 important seals. These rare seals were discovered from <br />over a dozen sites. The seals were engraved with animal motifs, <br />especially bulls, while many seals were inscribed in a script, which <br />is yet to be deciphered. The stolen seals include one which depicts <br />a unicorn and seven pictographs, another depicts animal figurines <br />and 10 pictographs on one side, and still another features an <br />elephant and manger on one side, and four pictographs on the other.</p>
<p>A detailed inquiry conducted by the local police revealed <br />the involvement of some senior officials of the archaeology <br />department, as well as a UK-based archaeologist in the theft. The <br />local police requested the archaeology department to hand over the <br />accused to the police for interrogation. A seven-page-long report <br />submitted to the authorities said the police have got solid evidence <br />that the three main accused in the theft had met with two <br />archaeologists 12 days before the robbery. "We have collected <br />evidence that shows that they had met with the accused in a seminar <br />organised by UNESCO for the preservation of the ruins of the Indus <br />Valley Civilisation, that was held 12 days prior to the theft," says <br />the report. During the investigations, police officials also <br />discovered that earlier some 120 old seals from the museum had been <br />replaced with replicas. "One of the museum officials, who was <br />involved, was forcibly retired by the authorities, but no major <br />action was taken against him and the case was hushed up," the report <br />noted. </p>
<p>The report not only demanded the arrest of these two <br />archaeologists, but also raised doubts about the authenticity of the <br />rest of the artifacts in the museum. "We have many doubts about the <br />originality of the artifacts on display in the museum. They have to <br />be re-certified," the report said, questioning the credibility of <br />the official curators of the museum. However, all requests from the <br />local police that the archaeology department hand over the two <br />officials have remained unheard.</p>
<p>Official apathy towards these archaeological treasures <br />has a long history. In the 70s, at least 171 recorded rare objects, <br />including some seals that belonged to the Moenjodaro museum, <br />disappeared without a trace and no inquiry has yet been initiated <br />into the scam. Sources said that at least one of the missing seals <br />was later spotted at an auction at the Christie's Amsterdam auction <br />house in 1990. This square seal depicting a unicorn and six <br />pictographs had been officially excavated from Moenjodaro and its <br />picture published in Marshall 1931 III, pl. cxv, no 549, with a <br />museum number: 55.35, clearly inscribed on it after 1971. <br />Intriguingly, most of the old registers in which these objects were <br />recorded were later replaced by new registers that do not mention <br />the missing objects at all. The old registers, meanwhile, have <br />disappeared. </p>
<p>The late Professor Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah, who jointly <br />edited the book, Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscription, with Asko <br />Parpola of Finland, mentioned in the preface that of all the seals <br />discovered by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in 1950 during his excavations at <br />Moenjodaro, only one is currently displayed in the museum. Some <br />years ago, a seal was seen in a private collection in Monaco. <br />Archaeologists and other researchers have demanded that the <br />government carry out a thorough inquiry into the case, but nothing <br />has been done so far.</p>
<p>According to informed sources, whenever the issue of <br />Moenjodaro is raised, the authorities in Islamabad claim that they <br />don't have enough funds available for the maintenance of the ruins <br />of Moenjodaro. This is absolutely untrue. According to inside <br />information, funds amounting to 0.934 million US dollars provided by <br />UNESCO after two agreements signed during 1991-1992 and 1991-1994 <br />are still lying unused with the federal government. Not a single <br />penny has been spent on Moenjodaro from these funds. Inside sources <br />maintain that UNESCO has been pressing the government to either <br />return these funds or use them for the allocated purpose. However, <br />to date, neither have these funds been returned to UNESCO, nor has <br />any work been initiated in Moenjodaro. Similarly, in the wake of the <br />rain damage during the 2003 monsoons, UNESCO sanctioned 10,000 <br />dollars to the department of archaeology for measures to save the <br />structures from further decay, but these funds again, could not be <br />utilised and the authorities had to return the money to UNESCO.</p>
<p>Apparently UNESCO has, once again, offered the federal <br />government 15,000 dollars to undertake preventive measures before <br />the coming monsoon, but so far no work has begun on the site. <br />Deliberate and wilful official callousness and corruption is <br />responsible for the slow, but steady destruction of this invaluable <br />historical site.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Monumental Disaster</p>
<p>  One of the world's greatest ancient wonders, Moenjodaro, is <br />  crumbling due to official callousness and corruption.</p>
<p>  By Massoud Ansari</p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsAug2004/expose.htm" title="http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsAug2004/expose.htm">http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsAug2004/expose.htm</a>  </p>
<p>  In the wilderness of Sindh's interior, the sleepy town of Dokri is <br />  home to one of the world's greatest ancientwonders: the houses, <br />  granary, baths, assembly halls, towers etc that make up the fabled <br />  Moenjodaro on the banks of the River Indus.</p>
<p>  Today, this magnificent archaeological site is on the <br />  verge of total destruction because of official apathy and <br />corruption.</p>
<p>  According to local officials, out of Moenjodaro's 370 <br />  walls, nearly 150 are on the verge of collapse. Though the budget <br />  allocated to preserve the country's heritage is always a pittance, <br />  the reasons officials cite for this latest tragedy is the fact <br />that <br />  there are no funds at all allocated for the upkeep and maintenance <br />  of one of the historical wonders of the world. "They have not <br />  allocated even a single penny for the current fiscal year for <br />  preserving Moenjodaro." </p>
<p>  A visit to these ruins reveals the extent of damage <br />caused <br />  by the state of negligence. According to experts, the DKG area in <br />  particular, needs immediate attention because recent rain-water <br />has <br />  seeped into the crevices, and damaged the majority of the <br />structures <br />  creating cracks in walls. The leaning walls are clearly visible <br />and <br />  even a layman can see that these walls will not be able to <br />withstand <br />  one more bout of the incoming monsoon rains. The rains have <br />affected <br />  other areas as well. Some portions of the stupa, as well as other <br />  structures, have also been badly damaged. Given that the ground is <br />  permeated with salts, archaeologists say, whenever it rains, the <br />  rainwater will carry ground-salt with it, corroding everything in <br />  its path. "In most cases, rains disintegrate the structures and <br />  constant vigilance is needed to keep the structures intact," says <br />an <br />  official at the site.</p>
<p>  Moenjodaro, also on UNESCO's list of world sites for <br />  preservation, is crumbling, not only because of ignorance, but <br />also <br />  due to misappropriation of funds. Only a few years ago, fed up <br />with <br />  official corruption in Pakistan, UNESCO threatened to remove <br />  Moenjodaro from its list of world heritage sites. "These world <br />  bodies donate funding, but instead of spending the money for the <br />  upkeep of the monuments the funds are misappropriated through <br />  salaries awarded on paper to phoney consultants, or used to line <br />the <br />  pockets of local government officials and fund their inflated <br />travel <br />  allowances," says a local official in Larkana.</p>
<p>  The nazim of Larkana district wrote several letters to <br />  the federal government asking them to either hand over the control <br />  of the upkeep of the ruins to the district government, or send <br />  experts as well as funds to preserve the site from further decay. <br />To <br />  the dismay of local government officials, they found that a <br />  Committee for the Preservation of Moenjodaro had already been <br />  established and members were drawing huge salaries from <br />  international funds allocated for the Authority for the <br />Preservation <br />  of Moenjodaro. However, all the Authority officials are based in <br />  Islamabad, a 1,000 miles away from the site. "Actually some <br />members <br />  of this committee visited the site, stayed in the hotel for a <br />couple <br />  of days, had fun and disappeared," says the DCO Larkana <br />  district. "They did not visit the site for any serious <br />  investigation."</p>
<p>  Archaeologists maintain that a minimum of five people <br />are <br />  needed for the upkeep of one section. Since the ruins are divided <br />  into seven sections, a skeleton staff of 35 is required. At the <br />  moment only 10 people are working on the seven areas of the site. <br />  Likewise, the only engineer working on the site was transferred a <br />  year ago and the authorities have yet to replace him. "It is <br />humanly <br />  impossible for 10 people to supervise such a huge area," says a <br />site <br />  official. As a result, even when visitors come to the site, <br />  especially during the holidays, they walk all over the already <br />  crumbling structures. Since only one-third of Moenjodaro has been <br />  excavated, sometimes the rains expose unexcavated artifacts which <br />  are carried away by visitors. "When they have appointed staff for <br />a <br />  committee to protect Moenjodaro, what are they doing in Islamabad? <br />  Why don't they move them or their office to the site where staff <br />is <br />  badly needed?" asks Khursheed Junejo, nazim of Larkana district. </p>
<p>  Official apathy can be gauged from the fact that only <br />two <br />  years ago, unknown criminals broke into the Moenjodaro museum and <br />  took away 40 important seals. These rare seals were discovered <br />from <br />  over a dozen sites. The seals were engraved with animal motifs, <br />  especially bulls, while many seals were inscribed in a script, <br />which <br />  is yet to be deciphered. The stolen seals include one which <br />depicts <br />  a unicorn and seven pictographs, another depicts animal figurines <br />  and 10 pictographs on one side, and still another features an <br />  elephant and manger on one side, and four pictographs on the other.</p>
<p>  A detailed inquiry conducted by the local police revealed <br />  the involvement of some senior officials of the archaeology <br />  department, as well as a UK-based archaeologist in the theft. The <br />  local police requested the archaeology department to hand over the <br />  accused to the police for interrogation. A seven-page-long report <br />  submitted to the authorities said the police have got solid <br />evidence <br />  that the three main accused in the theft had met with two <br />  archaeologists 12 days before the robbery. "We have collected <br />  evidence that shows that they had met with the accused in a <br />seminar <br />  organised by UNESCO for the preservation of the ruins of the Indus <br />  Valley Civilisation, that was held 12 days prior to the theft," <br />says <br />  the report. During the investigations, police officials also <br />  discovered that earlier some 120 old seals from the museum had <br />been <br />  replaced with replicas. "One of the museum officials, who was <br />  involved, was forcibly retired by the authorities, but no major <br />  action was taken against him and the case was hushed up," the <br />report <br />  noted. </p>
<p>  The report not only demanded the arrest of these two <br />  archaeologists, but also raised doubts about the authenticity of <br />the <br />  rest of the artifacts in the museum. "We have many doubts about <br />the <br />  originality of the artifacts on display in the museum. They have <br />to <br />  be re-certified," the report said, questioning the credibility of <br />  the official curators of the museum. However, all requests from <br />the <br />  local police that the archaeology department hand over the two <br />  officials have remained unheard.</p>
<p>  Official apathy towards these archaeological treasures <br />  has a long history. In the 70s, at least 171 recorded rare <br />objects, <br />  including some seals that belonged to the Moenjodaro museum, <br />  disappeared without a trace and no inquiry has yet been initiated <br />  into the scam. Sources said that at least one of the missing seals <br />  was later spotted at an auction at the Christie's Amsterdam <br />auction <br />  house in 1990. This square seal depicting a unicorn and six <br />  pictographs had been officially excavated from Moenjodaro and its <br />  picture published in Marshall 1931 III, pl. cxv, no 549, with a <br />  museum number: 55.35, clearly inscribed on it after 1971. <br />  Intriguingly, most of the old registers in which these objects <br />were <br />  recorded were later replaced by new registers that do not mention <br />  the missing objects at all. The old registers, meanwhile, have <br />  disappeared. </p>
<p>  The late Professor Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah, who <br />jointly <br />  edited the book, Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscription, with Asko <br />  Parpola of Finland, mentioned in the preface that of all the seals <br />  discovered by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in 1950 during his excavations <br />at <br />  Moenjodaro, only one is currently displayed in the museum. Some <br />  years ago, a seal was seen in a private collection in Monaco. <br />  Archaeologists and other researchers have demanded that the <br />  government carry out a thorough inquiry into the case, but nothing <br />  has been done so far.</p>
<p>  According to informed sources, whenever the issue of <br />  Moenjodaro is raised, the authorities in Islamabad claim that they <br />  don't have enough funds available for the maintenance of the ruins <br />  of Moenjodaro. This is absolutely untrue. According to inside <br />  information, funds amounting to 0.934 million US dollars provided <br />by <br />  UNESCO after two agreements signed during 1991-1992 and 1991-1994 <br />  are still lying unused with the federal government. Not a single <br />  penny has been spent on Moenjodaro from these funds. Inside <br />sources <br />  maintain that UNESCO has been pressing the government to either <br />  return these funds or use them for the allocated purpose. However, <br />  to date, neither have these funds been returned to UNESCO, nor has <br />  any work been initiated in Moenjodaro. Similarly, in the wake of <br />the <br />  rain damage during the 2003 monsoons, UNESCO sanctioned 10,000 <br />  dollars to the department of archaeology for measures to save the <br />  structures from further decay, but these funds again, could not be <br />  utilised and the authorities had to return the money to UNESCO.</p>
<p>  Apparently UNESCO has, once again, offered the federal <br />  government 15,000 dollars to undertake preventive measures before <br />  the coming monsoon, but so far no work has begun on the site. <br />  Deliberate and wilful official callousness and corruption is <br />  responsible for the slow, but steady destruction of this <br />invaluable <br />  historical site.</p>
