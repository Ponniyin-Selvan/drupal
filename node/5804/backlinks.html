<p>Dear V. Venkatesh,</p>
<p>Very nicely put .. without pinpointing..  </p>
<p>Heart of heart, I sympathise Rajendra I ..</p>
<p>HE IS THE GRANDEST AMONG THE CHOLAS ..</p>
<p>Did wonders under his father as Supreme Commander of Forces..</p>
<p>And was Crowned as Co-regent in 1012 AD..</p>
<p>After 30 years of innings of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , Rajendra I unleased from 1015 <br />onwards...</acronym></p>
<p>By that time, he could not confine his attention to the Southern <br />States alone.. </p>
<p>Had to workout strategies ..</p>
<p>Imagine making Bojan as a friend !! Sending army in support to <br />oppose Gazni..within 10 years of ascendancy..</p>
<p>After <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's demise (in about 1015 AD) Srivijayam had intimated<br />China to discourage Rajendra I and an Ambassador was not given due <br />recognition...</acronym></p>
<p>Think of the linguistic issues - Racial issues.. !!</p>
<p>And he STOOD UP AND UNDERTOOK overseas expeditions.. !!</p>
<p>NO OTHER INDIAN EMPEROR DID THIS, MY DEAR ...</p>
<p>Find his place in the Indian History !?</p>
<p><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's FAME eclipsed Rajendra I in Southern States ..</p>
<p>His Overseas Ventures did not gain due recognition from our <br />contemporary Historians..</p>
<p>Sorry, side trakced..</p>
<p>" INSTIGATGED WARS " is what prompted me to write.. </p>
<p>Very appropriately worded..</p>
<p>Rajendra's sister's (Kundavi) husband Vimaladithan (at Vengi) could <br />not handle his affairs himself and every time Rajendra I need to set <br />things right for him ..</p>
<p>thanks and regards / sps  </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Forwarding very interesting and informative posting by Dr. Jaybee<br />re Kulothunga I - Vikrama related to SIVAPURI INSCRIPTIONS ..</p>
<p>Thank you Dr. jaybee.. regards/ sps<br />============</p>
<p>Date: Wed, 11 Jul 2001 21:32:39 +0800<br />Subject: About the Dvarapalaka<br />X-Sender: jaybee@...<br />To: "agathiyar@yahoogroups.com"<br />Yahoo-Message-Num: 10714<br />===========================</p>
<p>Dr. Jaybee wrote:: Dear Friends,<br />=====================<br />I gave up sending the URL and re-uploaded a<br />different file with less KBs. And let the web-site<br />announce itself. Easier that way.<br />Sorry about the nuisance.xxxxxxxx<br />========================<br />This Dvarapalaka is one of a pair. It is<br />four-armed and is almost seven feet in height.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention about the fourth arm -<br />the left lower arm which is in the posture of<br />Kunjitha hastham. It points downwards, implying<br />"Bow ye down in supplication before My Lord and Master".</p>
<p>This temple is in a territory which lies in<br />the fringe area of the Chola-Pandya border.<br />It formed the centre of a huge Agaram -<br />grant to Brahmins who qualified themselves with the<br />knowledge and recital of the four VEdas. This Agaram<br />was called 'Niruba Sekara ChaturVEda Manggalam'.<br />An Agaram is otherwise known as Brahma DEsam.<br />They always have a title - ChaturVEda Manggalam.</p>
<p>The temple was rebuilt during the time of Kulothunga<br />Chola I.<br />This temple is of great historic value because of<br />several rare and unique information that can be gleaned<br />from it.<br />During the time of RajaRaja Chola, the Pandya country<br />was annexed to the Chola Empire. During Rajendra Chola I's<br />rule, the Pandyas were expelled and made into persona non grata -<br />without any recognition - and simply made into non-entities.<br />Their identity was made non-existant.<br />A new dynasty was formed.<br />The sons of Rajendra Chola were conferred the title of<br />ChOla-PAndya and ruled as the kings in the PAndya country.<br />They went by names like 'Sundara ChOla-PAndya' etc.<br />Every town, village were renamed after the ChOlas.<br />Even irrigation tanks and canals were thus renamed.<br />The Pandya country was renamed 'RAjaRAja PAndya NAdu'.<br />Countries were divided into provinces called 'vaLa nAdu's.<br />These were subdivided into 'nAdu's and 'kURRam's. The<br />next sub-subdivision was 'Ur' and 'GrAmam'.<br />The province of 'KEraLa Singga VaLa NAdu' became<br />'RAjEndra ChOla VaLa NAdu'. 'Niruba SEkara ChadurVEda<br />Manggalam' became 'ChOla MArthANda Chatur VEda Manggalam'.<br />One canal was renamed into 'KarikAl ChOla VAykkAl'. And<br />an irrigation tank came to be called 'Sri Kundhavai<br />PErEri'.<br />This process is known as 'ChOlianisation'.</p>
<p>There was a colony of merchants called 'Thisai Ayirathu<br />AinURRuvar'. They had a chief town called AruviyUr'. The<br />merchants of AruviyUr were liberal patrons for this temple.<br />I was able to discover AruviyUr because of the information<br />that I collected from this temple.</p>
<p>*I also discovered a class of warriors called 'VALIlAr'-<br />????????. There is a reference to them in an inscription of the<br />12th year of Vikrama ChOla. I traced their descendants who<br />are still around after 800 years. *</p>
<p>KulOthunga ChOla I does not belong to the direct<br />lineage of the VijayAlaya line of ChOlas to which RAja RAja<br />or RAjEndra belonged. He was actually a prince of the<br />Eastern Chalukya(Telugu) dyansty. But due to repeated<br />intermarriage with the Imperial ChOlas, he had more ChOla<br />blood in him than Chalukya.</p>
<p>But there had been upheavals when and after he came<br />to power. For one thing, the Pandya country became loosened<br />from his grip. Inscriptions belonging to the same time -<br />even engraved by the same sthapathi, are found. Some<br />would bear the name of KulOthungga. But there are others which<br />bear the name of one SriVallabha PAndya. That is to say,<br />the PAndyas had been reinstated.<br />But all the same, KulOthungga maintained many<br />cantonments of the army right upto the Cape Kumari.</p>
<p>We also find something sinister taking place during<br />his reign. His feudatories and war-lords meet in the temple<br />and take oaths of allegience with each other. Breaking of the<br />oath was denounced with the severest imprecations and curses.<br />I have come across four such pacts in that temple.</p>
<p>The other peculiarity is that, although it is<br />dedicated to ThAnthOnRIswarar - Svayam PrakAshar or Svayambhu<br />Linggam, there is an installed SivaLinggam. What happened<br />to the original Svayambhu? May be I am the only one alive<br />who knows.</p>
<p>Another strange thing is that, all the contemporary<br />temples in that territory were destroyed and sacked by<br />the Turks. But this temple was only partially destroyed.<br />Somehow the Turks seem to have abandoned the sacking<br />somewhere along the line. There is a very interesting and<br />strange story behind it.</p>
<p>The Nandhi is huge, The Dvarapalakas are huge; but the SivaLinggam is very small.</p>
<p>There are also two hidden chambers, one of which was<br />opened by me - much to my future regret.<br />Many a times, I would go to the temple to copy the<br />inscriptions. The GurukkaL would make some Horlicks and<br />leave it with me; and then he would lock the temple from<br />outside during the 'uchchi kAlam'.<br />I would be alone. At certain particular times,<br />I would feel a tingling sensation on the nape of my neck.<br />I would feel something; something creepy. The hair would<br />stand on its end. There will be some loud wind blowing; the trees will be shaking. That will be around mid-day.<br />Most often, I used to hear voices and sounds of<br />people walking around. Sometimes, I had a sensation that<br />somebody or somebodies were watching me closely from<br />behind.<br />Who or what were they?<br />I don't know.<br />Never found out.<br />Never could find out.<br />I never turned back to look.<br />I am not supposed to look back.<br />So I never did.<br />I even found a long hidden valuable inscription by<br />a freak occurance.<br />Even two years ago, I found a freize of GajaSamhara<br />Murthi. It is the smallest that can be found. It was also<br />found unexpectedly.<br />The ChAmundi statue is so full of life that it can<br />enchant you. So is the Amman 'Dharma Samvardhini' or 'ARam<br />VaLartha NAyagi'.<br />Even the jade Sivalinggam for which I do the daily puja,<br />called ThAnthOnRIswarar, came to me under strange circumstances.</p>
<p>But this temple which has withstood the onslaughts and<br />vicissitudes, and ravages of time, is now succumbing to vandalism<br />of the first order. It is taking place under the pretext of<br />renovation. Many beautiful edifices have been broken up or<br />smothered with concrete.<br />These present day vandals are worse than Malik kafur<br />or Kusrau Khan or Thuglaq.</p>

<p>HATTUR (near Raichur) INSCRIPTIONS : In 1006, Rajendra virtually<br />ransacked North West with an Army of 900000 (Nine Lakhs) Warriors. <br />He subdued Maykedam (Raichur). He removed Satyachreyan West Chalukya<br />and killed him. He installed his siter's husband Vimaladithan in<br />Vengi (East Chalukya) throne.. By this process, he gained access <br />from Thanjavur to Vijawada / Vizag freely. (Vizag Dhivakar / Kalinga <br />Balu will help with more details).</p>
<p>Then, post 1022 took Eastern Kalinga - and formed excellent strategy<br />with Bhoja King and completed Ganges expedition. Gazni ran away to<br />Somnathpur hearing of Rajendra's Army !</p>

<p>    Think I stirred the hornet's nest here. <br />    1. There is a mention of a Tamil-brahmi inscription in<br />    mamandur which is deciphered by Iravatham Mahadeven<br />    and dated as the later part of the 2nd century AD. As<br />    per the timelines, Pallavas does not appear on the<br />    horizon till the middle of the third century AD and<br />    they start using the Tamil-Brahmi right away. Meaning,<br />    the script is already available for usage. But it<br />    would be interesting to see the kind of changes they<br />    introduced. But as per my readings, tamil-brahmi is<br />    what is referred as pallava scripts by the south<br />    eastern historians. I am open to change my view if<br />    there is evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>    2.My contention is that the merchantile contact with<br />    the south east asia is what is responsible for the<br />    introduction of the script in these areas and Pallavas<br />    has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>    3. The only known military raid(atleast to me) is by<br />    Rajendra I and by one of his successors which resulted<br />    in more contacts with SE Asia and more intermingling<br />    between the Indian settlers and the natives. This<br />    resulted in the formation of communities with mixed<br />    Hindu/Buddhist heritage and influenced heavily by<br />    Indic culture.</p>
<p>    4. There were Hindu kings who ruled in SE Asia and<br />    this is the reason for the fantastic temples still<br />    found as ruins. And the reason for a lot of hindu epic<br />    reliefs in buddhist temples like borobadur, Angor<br />    Wat(which was converted to a buddhist temple) etc.</p>
<p>    Back to John Keay, he calls the 'wars' of Rajaraja and<br />    Rajendra as raids for plunder and cites an inscription<br />    by the Chalukyas lamenting the loss of wealth due to<br />    the plunder of Chola forces. <br />  ============================<br />  =================================</p>
<p>  Also cites from the<br />    sources in Sri Lanka about Rajaraja's plunder of<br />    Anurathapura and equates it with raids by, hold your<br />    breath, Mohamed of Ghazni. <br />  ======================<br />--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Sivapathasekaran"</p></mprakas@></p></blockquote>

<p>ARE 103 of 1926 gives a rare information :</p>
<p>On the East and North Walls of the Central Shreine, Uktavedeswara<br />Temple, Kuttalam, Thanjavur District, inscriptions of RR's 7th<br />Regnl yrs, found on<br />about 14 fragments.</p>
<p>Various expenses for worship and offerings in the temple stated to<br />have been built by SEMBIYAN MAHADEVIYAR, the Mother of Uthama<br />Chozhar, are recorded in detail.</p>
<p>Out of several dieties worshipped here, one was "AMARAPUJANGADEVA"<br />in the temple. Amarapujangan name is very much familiar to PS<br />fans !</p>
<p>In the 2nd piece .. Kopparakesari .. Uthama .. Yr missing ..</p>
<p>In the 10 piece (21 to 28 lines are) worth noticing :</p>

<p>Meaning :</p>
<p>The Grants were made by Sembiyan madevi in Uthama's period.<br />Rajaraja is regularising the grants. He has reproduced the<br />inscriptions of Uthama upto the 10th piece :</p>
<p>In the inscriptions of Uthama, it was recited as : UTHAMA<br />CHOZHOLARAI THIRUVAYIRU VAAYTHA SEMBIAN MAHADEVIYAR.</p>
<p>In subsequent pieces, Rajarajan denotes her as "Ippirattiyar" ..</p>
<p>Therefore, the famous quote of 'Uthama Chozhar Thiruvayiruthitha<br />Sembiyan Mahadeviyar " is first recorded by UTHAMA CHOZHA<br />himself !</p>
<p>There is also inscriptional evidence that (periya) Pazhuvettarayar<br />and Sundara<br />Chozha are contempraries!<br />=========================</p></sps10142004@></p>

Some obscure Karnata chief seems to have followed <br />Rajendra<br />  and settled<br />  generally taken<br />    to be the founder of the Sena dynasty". To commemorate this <br />celebrated<br />    victory, Rajendra assumed the title of Gangaikonda Chola, a name <br />given<br />    not<br />    only to his new capital (Gangaikondacholapuram) but also to his<br />  temple.<br />    "<br />      =================================<br />    SPS wrote earlier :<br />    I have been reading extensively on Rajendra Chozha.<br />    Summarising : He was called Rajendra Chozha devar in the 4th <br />yr<br />    inscription of RR (989 AD). Means he should have been grown <br />up by<br />    then.</p>
<p>    Rajendra was the c-in-c for Kanthalurchalai conquest :: 988 AD.<br />    Means he was all along in the limelight for about 25 years <br />till RR<br />    installed him in Chozha throne in 1012, after Big temple <br />consecration<br />    in<br />    1010 and then he had an excellent innings - in the North and <br />Overseas.</p>
<p>    Rajendra accomplished two things which his father desired :<br />    (1) brought India mudi and Sundara haaram from Rohana hills, <br />Lanka;     (2) Conquering Manyakedam @ Gulbargha :: RR vowed not to take </p></blockquote>
<p>part in</p>
<blockquote><p>    Jalakkreedai till he conquored Manyakedam!</p>
<p>    Rajendra conquored not only Then-Madurai (Pandyas) but also <br />Vada<br />    Madurai (Madura of Lord Krishna!) - confirms his Meykeerthi. He <br />was a<br />    good friend of Bojarajan of Ujjain (Vikramaditha famous), along <br />with<br />    whom he fought against Md Gazni. Fearing the might of<br />    Rajendra, Gazni left for Somnathpur and ransacked there.</p>
<p>    His ganges expedition was not a mere pilgrimage. His <br />commanders<br />    overstayed<br />    and ruled certain parts of North! (as pointed by his name-<br />sake!)</p>
<p>    RR consolidated Chozha holdings. But Rajendra expanded them <br />beyond the<br />    dreams of any Tamil Kings.</p>
<p>    Marghazhi Thiruvadhirai is his birth star. Annabishekam at <br />Gangai<br />    Konda<br />    Chozhapuram on that day - ARUDRA DARSANAM - is very famous <br />even today.</p>
<p>    Another interesting thing : In RR's period, his Queen <br />Olgamadevi<br />  gifted<br />    a<br />    Aadalvallan (Nataraja) to Big Temple with 9 Sadais and Ganges <br />in it.<br />    Present one in Big temple is having 10 sadais. Original piece <br />is not<br />    there. Apart from this, there are very few Natarajas which had <br />Ganges<br />    in the sadai till RR's period.</p>
<p>    After Rajendra's Ganges expedition only, it has become a MUST <br />and<br />    praactice to include Ganges in the Nataraja's sadai.<br />    ======================</p>
<p>  I know, I know I am going<br />    to take a lot of flak for this, but barring the<br />    comparison, I tend to think that war is ugly and there<br />    is always the possibility that plunder was a necessity<br />    to bring other people to submission.</p>

<p>    Venketesh,</p>
<p>    I feel you missed my point. I never compared the invasions of <br />    Rajendra and Ghazni with one another. </p>
<p>    While expressing my anguish at Rajendra not being accorded the <br />    grandeur, he deserved, by the Biased (if I can say so) North <br />Indian <br />    historians, regarding Ghazni, I only said that he did not dare <br />to <br />    venture into Rajendra's territory and this speaks volumes about <br />    Rajendra's greatness and valour. I did not say that Rajendra was <br />    very noble, in comparison to the 'bloody' invasions of Ghazni. <br />Hope <br />    I have clarified.</p>
<p>    So from a invaded citizen's perspective, there will be no <br />  difference <br />    between Ghazni or any other King.</p>
<p>    Regards,<br />    Venkatesh</p>
<p>    PS: I, personally, still believe Rajendra or Narasimhavarma were <br />  not <br />    as ruthless as Ghazni, who was involved in mass killing of <br />people, <br />    just because they were following a different religion than that <br />of <br />    his. Somnath temple incident is the testimony to this. Atleast <br />as <br />    far as Narasimhavarma's plundering of Vatapi is considered, he <br />only <br />    wreaked vengeance on the King and indirectly his subjects while <br />    religion was no cause or barrier. But you know that Ghazni's <br />case <br />    was totally different.</p>

<p>      never ventured into Rajendra-I's territory. </p>
<p>        Madhan mentions about this in his book "vandhArgaL <br />vendRargaL". <br />        (That was a real "bloody" account of the Ruthless invasions <br />of <br />    the <br />        Mohammedans). He even throws the question as to whether <br />Ghazni <br />      never <br />        had the courage to venture into Rajendra's territory. But <br />does <br />    not <br />        conclude and leaves it for the readers to conclude. Whatever <br />  the <br />        reason may be, the fact that Ghazni did not venture into <br />    Rajendra's <br />        territory, speaks volumes about his greatness!!!</p>
<p>        Unfortunately all the historians from the north were so <br />biased <br />    that <br />        they even refused to look down to the history of the south, <br />    except <br />        for the cursory glance. This is clearly indicated by KAN <br />Sastri <br />    in <br />        his book "History of South India". </p>
<p>        Nevertheless, a Tubelight cannot overpower the one and only <br />    Sun!!! </p>
<p>        I feel RRC's fame eclipsed Rajendra's only because, after <br />the <br />        initial invasions to expand the empire, RRC concentrated a <br />lot <br />    on <br />        the people welfare and local administration which kept him <br />  amids <br />      the <br />        masses. While we know that Rajendra was always fighting and <br />        expanding the empire to a larger extent than that was under <br />  RRC. <br />    So <br />        keeping the popularity aside, both were equally great in <br />    respective <br />        aspects and I, personally, cannot favour one over the other.</p>

<p>            In fact, it was <br />            recorded that even Rajendra I did not have a peaceful <br />reign <br />    and <br />          had <br />            to involve himself in a lot of "instigated" wars, though <br />he <br />    won <br />          all <br />            or most of them. But this was just indicative of the <br />fact <br />    that <br />        his <br />            enemies were not some incompetent bunch of local <br />landlords <br />    and <br />          they <br />            were a "power" by themselves who could not be discarded. </p>
<p>          Dear V. Venkatesh,</p>
<p>          Very nicely put .. without pinpointing..  </p>
<p>          Heart of heart, I sympathise Rajendra I ..</p>
<p>          HE IS THE GRANDEST AMONG THE CHOLAS ..</p>
<p>          Did wonders under his father as Supreme Commander of <br />Forces..</p>
<p>          And was Crowned as Co-regent in 1012 AD..</p>
<p>          After 30 years of innings of RRC, Rajendra I unleased from <br />    1015 <br />          onwards...</p>
<p>          By that time, he could not confine his attention to the <br />    Southern <br />          States alone.. </p>
<p>          Had to workout strategies ..</p>
<p>          Imagine making Bojan as a friend !! Sending army in <br />support <br />  to <br />          oppose Gazni..within 10 years of ascendancy..</p>
<p>          After RRC's demise (in about 1015 AD) Srivijayam had <br />intimated<br />          China to discourage Rajendra I and an Ambassador was not <br />  given <br />      due <br />          recognition...</p>
<p>          Think of the linguistic issues - Racial issues.. !!</p>
<p>          And he STOOD UP AND UNDERTOOK overseas expeditions.. !!</p>
<p>          NO OTHER INDIAN EMPEROR DID THIS, MY DEAR ...</p>
<p>          Find his place in the Indian History !?</p>
<p>          RRC's FAME eclipsed Rajendra I in Southern States ..</p>
<p>          His Overseas Ventures did not gain due recognition from <br />our <br />          contemporary Historians..</p>
<p>          Sorry, side trakced..</p>
<p>          " INSTIGATGED WARS " is what prompted me to write.. </p>
<p>          Very appropriately worded..</p>
<p>          Rajendra's sister's (Kundavi) husband Vimaladithan (at <br />Vengi) <br />        could <br />          not handle his affairs himself and every time Rajendra I <br />need <br />    to <br />        set <br />          things right for him ..</p>
<p>          thanks and regards / sps</p>

<p>    SPS,</p>
<p>    You are right. That is why I thought for a minute<br />  before I coined <br />    the words "Instigated Wars". I am pretty sure,<br />  Rajendra I would not <br />    have felt, his own invasions, as a problem. But<br />  when some one <br />    instigates when his concentration is elsewhere,<br />  then it is a <br />  problem <br />    and you have clearly exposed it in your last para<br />  regarding the <br />    inability of Kundavai and Vimaladitya.</p>
<p>    Yes, I feel disgusted about the fact that the<br />  Foreign Invasions <br />    (through the seas) of Rajendra I was never<br />  accorded the grandeur, <br />  it <br />    deserved, in history. We do not know why, but<br />  Ghazni the rogue <br />    emperor, who destroyed almost all the North, North<br />  Central and <br />    Western India, never ventured into Rajendra-I's<br />  territory. </p>
<p>    Madhan mentions about this in his book "vandhArgaL<br />  vendRargaL". <br />    (That was a real "bloody" account of the Ruthless<br />  invasions of the <br />    Mohammedans). He even throws the question as to<br />  whether Ghazni <br />  never <br />    had the courage to venture into Rajendra's<br />  territory. But does not <br />    conclude and leaves it for the readers to<br />  conclude. Whatever the <br />    reason may be, the fact that Ghazni did not<br />  venture into Rajendra's <br />    territory, speaks volumes about his greatness!!!</p>
<p>    Unfortunately all the historians from the north<br />  were so biased that <br />    they even refused to look down to the history of<br />  the south, except <br />    for the cursory glance. This is clearly indicated<br />  by KAN Sastri in <br />    his book "History of South India". </p>
<p>    Nevertheless, a Tubelight cannot overpower the one<br />  and only Sun!!! </p>
<p>    I feel RRC's fame eclipsed Rajendra's only<br />  because, after the <br />    initial invasions to expand the empire, RRC<br />  concentrated a lot on <br />    the people welfare and local administration which<br />  kept him amids <br />  the <br />    masses. While we know that Rajendra was always<br />  fighting and <br />    expanding the empire to a larger extent than that<br />  was under RRC. So <br />    keeping the popularity aside, both were equally<br />  great in respective <br />    aspects and I, personally, cannot favour one over<br />  the other.</p>

<p>        In fact, it was <br />        recorded that even Rajendra I did not have a<br />  peaceful reign and <br />      had <br />        to involve himself in a lot of "instigated"<br />  wars, though he won <br />      all <br />        or most of them. But this was just indicative<br />  of the fact that <br />    his <br />        enemies were not some incompetent bunch of<br />  local landlords and <br />      they <br />        were a "power" by themselves who could not be<br />  discarded. </p>
<p>      Dear V. Venkatesh,</p>
<p>      Very nicely put .. without pinpointing.. </p>
<p>      Heart of heart, I sympathise Rajendra I ..</p>
<p>      HE IS THE GRANDEST AMONG THE CHOLAS ..</p>
<p>      Did wonders under his father as Supreme<br />  Commander of Forces..</p>
<p>      And was Crowned as Co-regent in 1012 AD..</p>
<p>      After 30 years of innings of RRC, Rajendra I<br />  unleased from 1015 <br />      onwards...</p>
<p>      By that time, he could not confine his attention<br />  to the Southern <br />      States alone.. </p>
<p>      Had to workout strategies ..</p>
<p>      Imagine making Bojan as a friend !! Sending army<br />  in support to <br />      oppose Gazni..within 10 years of ascendancy..</p>
<p>      After RRC's demise (in about 1015 AD) Srivijayam<br />  had intimated<br />      China to discourage Rajendra I and an Ambassador<br />  was not given <br />  due <br />      recognition...</p>
<p>      Think of the linguistic issues - Racial issues..<br />  !!</p>
<p>      And he STOOD UP AND UNDERTOOK overseas<br />  expeditions.. !!</p>
<p>      NO OTHER INDIAN EMPEROR DID THIS, MY DEAR ...</p>
<p>      Find his place in the Indian History !?</p>
<p>      RRC's FAME eclipsed Rajendra I in Southern<br />  States ..</p>
<p>      His Overseas Ventures did not gain due<br />  recognition from our <br />      contemporary Historians..</p>
<p>      Sorry, side trakced..</p>
<p>      " INSTIGATGED WARS " is what prompted me to<br />  write.. </p>

<p>      Rajendra's sister's (Kundavi) husband<br />  Vimaladithan (at Vengi) <br />    could <br />      not handle his affairs himself and every time<br />  Rajendra I need to <br />    set <br />      things right for him ..</p>

<p>  You are right. That is why I thought for a minute before I coined <br />  the words "Instigated Wars". I am pretty sure, Rajendra I would not <br />  have felt, his own invasions, as a problem. But when some one <br />  instigates when his concentration is elsewhere, then it is a <br />problem <br />  and you have clearly exposed it in your last para regarding the <br />  inability of Kundavai and Vimaladitya.</p>
<p>  Yes, I feel disgusted about the fact that the Foreign Invasions <br />  (through the seas) of Rajendra I was never accorded the grandeur, <br />it <br />  deserved, in history. We do not know why, but Ghazni the rogue <br />  emperor, who destroyed almost all the North, North Central and <br />  Western India, never ventured into Rajendra-I's territory. </p>
<p>  Madhan mentions about this in his book "vandhArgaL vendRargaL". <br />  (That was a real "bloody" account of the Ruthless invasions of the <br />  Mohammedans). He even throws the question as to whether Ghazni <br />never <br />  had the courage to venture into Rajendra's territory. But does not <br />  conclude and leaves it for the readers to conclude. Whatever the <br />  reason may be, the fact that Ghazni did not venture into Rajendra's <br />  territory, speaks volumes about his greatness!!!</p>
<p>  Unfortunately all the historians from the north were so biased that <br />  they even refused to look down to the history of the south, except <br />  for the cursory glance. This is clearly indicated by KAN Sastri in <br />  his book "History of South India". </p>
<p>  Nevertheless, a Tubelight cannot overpower the one and only Sun!!! </p>
<p>  I feel RRC's fame eclipsed Rajendra's only because, after the <br />  initial invasions to expand the empire, RRC concentrated a lot on <br />  the people welfare and local administration which kept him amids <br />the <br />  masses. While we know that Rajendra was always fighting and <br />  expanding the empire to a larger extent than that was under RRC. So <br />  keeping the popularity aside, both were equally great in respective <br />  aspects and I, personally, cannot favour one over the other.</p>

<p>      In fact, it was <br />      recorded that even Rajendra I did not have a peaceful reign and <br />    had <br />      to involve himself in a lot of "instigated" wars, though he won <br />    all <br />      or most of them.

        <p>Hi <br />some where in the archives are the kalvettus about the cruelty of <br />pallavas and cholas</p>
<p>of course these were in the invaded territories.<br />i realise it was a cruel age and kings had to be very cruel to even <br />survive let alone succeed.</p>
<p>vathapi was burnt to ashes by the pallavas. that is as bad as an <br />invader can get.<br />i dont think religion should be an issue <br />ghazni is on record having feudatory hindu kings.</p>
<p>and the point of ghazni not venturing into rajendras territory too is <br />disputed.<br />ghazni's last visit to india was somnath and gujarath. did rajendra's <br />territory border gujarath.<br />even when ghazni came into gujarat in his last years he was having <br />lots of problems back home . last 4 years of his life i dont think he <br />ventured out of afganistan.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Venketesh,</p>
<p>  I feel you missed my point. I never compared the invasions of <br />  Rajendra and Ghazni with one another. </p>
<p>  While expressing my anguish at Rajendra not being accorded the <br />  grandeur, he deserved, by the Biased (if I can say so) North Indian <br />  historians, regarding Ghazni, I only said that he did not dare to <br />  venture into Rajendra's territory and this speaks volumes about <br />  Rajendra's greatness and valour. I did not say that Rajendra was <br />  very noble, in comparison to the 'bloody' invasions of Ghazni. Hope <br />  I have clarified.</p>
<p>  So from a invaded citizen's perspective, there will be no <br />difference <br />  between Ghazni or any other King.</p>
<p>  Regards,<br />  Venkatesh</p>
<p>  PS: I, personally, still believe Rajendra or Narasimhavarma were <br />not <br />  as ruthless as Ghazni, who was involved in mass killing of people, <br />  just because they were following a different religion than that of <br />  his. Somnath temple incident is the testimony to this. Atleast as <br />  far as Narasimhavarma's plundering of Vatapi is considered, he only <br />  wreaked vengeance on the King and indirectly his subjects while <br />  religion was no cause or barrier. But you know that Ghazni's case <br />  was totally different.</p>

          RAJENDRA - I        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Venketesh,</p>
<p>I feel you missed my point. I never compared the invasions of <br />Rajendra and Ghazni with one another. </p>
<p>While expressing my anguish at Rajendra not being accorded the <br />grandeur, he deserved, by the Biased (if I can say so) North Indian <br />historians, regarding Ghazni, I only said that he did not dare to <br />venture into Rajendra's territory and this speaks volumes about <br />Rajendra's greatness and valour. I did not say that Rajendra was <br />very noble, in comparison to the 'bloody' invasions of Ghazni. Hope <br />I have clarified.</p>
<p>So from a invaded citizen's perspective, there will be no difference <br />between Ghazni or any other King.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh</p>
<p>PS: I, personally, still believe Rajendra or Narasimhavarma were not <br />as ruthless as Ghazni, who was involved in mass killing of people, <br />just because they were following a different religion than that of <br />his. Somnath temple incident is the testimony to this. Atleast as <br />far as Narasimhavarma's plundering of Vatapi is considered, he only <br />wreaked vengeance on the King and indirectly his subjects while <br />religion was no cause or barrier. But you know that Ghazni's case <br />was totally different.</p>

<p>  Hi<br />  dont all invasions have to be under one category regardless of the <br />  religion of the invader<br />  rajendras invasions and mamalla's before that have been recorded <br />in <br />  very bad light by the countries which suffered the invasions.<br />  similarly the mahavmsa in lanka also records the destruction <br />wrought <br />  by the chola's<br />  just a logical question<br />  how come ghazni was different from rajendra?<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>  never ventured into Rajendra-I's territory. </p>
<p>    Madhan mentions about this in his book "vandhArgaL vendRargaL". <br />    (That was a real "bloody" account of the Ruthless invasions of <br />the <br />    Mohammedans). He even throws the question as to whether Ghazni <br />  never <br />    had the courage to venture into Rajendra's territory. But does <br />not <br />    conclude and leaves it for the readers to conclude. Whatever the <br />    reason may be, the fact that Ghazni did not venture into <br />Rajendra's <br />    territory, speaks volumes about his greatness!!!</p>
<p>    Unfortunately all the historians from the north were so biased <br />that <br />    they even refused to look down to the history of the south, <br />except <br />    for the cursory glance. This is clearly indicated by KAN Sastri <br />in <br />    his book "History of South India". </p>
<p>    Nevertheless, a Tubelight cannot overpower the one and only <br />Sun!!! </p>
<p>    I feel RRC's fame eclipsed Rajendra's only because, after the <br />    initial invasions to expand the empire, RRC concentrated a lot <br />on <br />    the people welfare and local administration which kept him amids <br />  the <br />    masses. While we know that Rajendra was always fighting and <br />    expanding the empire to a larger extent than that was under RRC. <br />So <br />    keeping the popularity aside, both were equally great in <br />respective <br />    aspects and I, personally, cannot favour one over the other.</p>

<p>    Yes, I feel disgusted about the fact that the Foreign Invasions<br />    (through the seas) of Rajendra I was never accorded the <br />grandeur, it<br />    deserved, in history. We do not know why, but Ghazni the rogue<br />    emperor, who destroyed almost all the North, North Central and<br />    Western India, never ventured into Rajendra-I's territory.</p></blockquote>

          RAJENDRA - I        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>SPS,</p>
<p>You are right. That is why I thought for a minute before I coined <br />the words "Instigated Wars". I am pretty sure, Rajendra I would not <br />have felt, his own invasions, as a problem. But when some one <br />instigates when his concentration is elsewhere, then it is a problem <br />and you have clearly exposed it in your last para regarding the <br />inability of Kundavai and Vimaladitya.</p>
<p>Yes, I feel disgusted about the fact that the Foreign Invasions <br />(through the seas) of Rajendra I was never accorded the grandeur, it <br />deserved, in history. We do not know why, but Ghazni the rogue <br />emperor, who destroyed almost all the North, North Central and <br />Western India, never ventured into Rajendra-I's territory. </p>
<p>Madhan mentions about this in his book "vandhArgaL vendRargaL". <br />(That was a real "bloody" account of the Ruthless invasions of the <br />Mohammedans). He even throws the question as to whether Ghazni never <br />had the courage to venture into Rajendra's territory. But does not <br />conclude and leaves it for the readers to conclude. Whatever the <br />reason may be, the fact that Ghazni did not venture into Rajendra's <br />territory, speaks volumes about his greatness!!!</p>
<p>Unfortunately all the historians from the north were so biased that <br />they even refused to look down to the history of the south, except <br />for the cursory glance. This is clearly indicated by <acronym title="KA Neelakanta shastri" KAN</acronym  Sastri in <br />his book "History of South India". </acronym></p>
<p>Nevertheless, a Tubelight cannot overpower the one and only Sun!!! </p>
<p>I feel <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's fame eclipsed Rajendra's only because, after the <br />initial invasions to expand the empire, <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  concentrated a lot on <br />the people welfare and local administration which kept him amids the <br />masses. While we know that Rajendra was always fighting and <br />expanding the empire to a larger extent than that was under <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym . So <br />keeping the popularity aside, both were equally great in respective <br />aspects and I, personally, cannot favour one over the other.</acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>Regards,<br />Venkatesh<br />--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Sivapathasekaran" <br /><sps10142004@...  wrote:</p>

<p>    In fact, it was <br />    recorded that even Rajendra I did not have a peaceful reign and <br />  had <br />    to involve himself in a lot of "instigated" wars, though he won <br />  all <br />    or most of them. But this was just indicative of the fact that <br />his <br />    enemies were not some incompetent bunch of local landlords and <br />  they <br />    were a "power" by themselves who could not be discarded. </p>
<p>  Dear V. Venkatesh,</p>
<p>  Very nicely put .. without pinpointing..  </p>
<p>  Heart of heart, I sympathise Rajendra I ..</p>
<p>  HE IS THE GRANDEST AMONG THE CHOLAS ..</p>
<p>  Did wonders under his father as Supreme Commander of Forces..</p>
<p>  And was Crowned as Co-regent in 1012 AD..</p>
<p>  After 30 years of innings of RRC, Rajendra I unleased from 1015 <br />  onwards...</p>
<p>  By that time, he could not confine his attention to the Southern <br />  States alone.. </p>
<p>  Had to workout strategies ..</p>
<p>  Imagine making Bojan as a friend !! Sending army in support to <br />  oppose Gazni..within 10 years of ascendancy..</p>
<p>  After RRC's demise (in about 1015 AD) Srivijayam had intimated<br />  China to discourage Rajendra I and an Ambassador was not given due <br />  recognition...</p>
<p>  Think of the linguistic issues - Racial issues.. !!</p>
<p>  And he STOOD UP AND UNDERTOOK overseas expeditions.. !!</p>
<p>  NO OTHER INDIAN EMPEROR DID THIS, MY DEAR ...</p>
<p>  Find his place in the Indian History !?</p>
<p>  RRC's FAME eclipsed Rajendra I in Southern States ..</p>
<p>  His Overseas Ventures did not gain due recognition from our <br />  contemporary Historians..</p>
<p>  Sorry, side trakced..</p>
<p>  " INSTIGATGED WARS " is what prompted me to write.. </p>
<p>  Very appropriately worded..</p>
<p>  Rajendra's sister's (Kundavi) husband Vimaladithan (at Vengi) <br />could <br />  not handle his affairs himself and every time Rajendra I need to <br />set <br />  things right for him ..</p>
<p>  thanks and regards / sps</p>
