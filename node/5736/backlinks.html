</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Hello, am wondering if anyone has read the original book by <br />Kothamangalam Subbu. Sadly it is out of print but old ananda vikatan <br />bound volumes may be available in some people's homes. Lot of people <br />do not even know this classic was a book, story serialised in AV, and <br />with really nice pictures by Gopulu. It was very difficult to treat <br />with complex descriptions of intricacies of music and dance, I got <br />through two chapters with great difficulty with my grandmother's aid. <br />Would love to read it again but unfortunately I don't think it is <br />available.</p>
<p>The movie was also good but very commerialised version of the story <br />with much older actors. </p>
<p>If anyone knows more would be glad to know!!</p>
<p>Malathi</p>

        <p>A few episodes of Malgudi days is available in youtube. Its a Hindi version. I saw two <br />episodes just now. Dont remember ever seeing them during my schoold days inDD, but the <br />music is really haunting. A well made serial. </p>
<p>I used to think that the quality of serials done by DD a decade back, are much much better <br />than the serials of these days. Good story lines, crisp episodes (just 13 to 15 weeks). I think <br />the mega serials started with Junoon in DD2...which paved for the Junoon tamil and 'kolai' of <br />serials.</p>
<p>Just recently we had a discussion about Hindi in TN. Most of the people used to learn hindi <br />just by seeing the serials. But after the tamizhakkam came in to existence,again the learning <br />curve of Hindi by the common people came to a stop. </p>

        <p>Dear Kathy, it was made both in English and Hindi. You<br />can find the English version on Amazon..</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Malgudi-Days-2-Disc-Set/dp/B000E0P2MW/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1209231382&amp;sr=8-2" title="http://www.amazon.com/Malgudi-Days-2-Disc-Set/dp/B000E0P2MW/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1209231382&amp;sr=8-2">http://www.amazon.com/Malgudi-Days-2-Disc-Set/dp/B000E0P2MW/ref=pd_bbs_s...</a></p>
<p>It is well worth the price. Actually Nag made three<br />sets of tv serials, Malgudi Days, Swami and Friends<br />and Sweet Shop Vendor. All of them were extremely good<br />and the normally reticent RKN himself had to<br />acknowledge credit. </p>
<p>Only Malgudi days is available on DVD. I called<br />Padamrag films, the copyright owners while in<br />Bangalore and they said there was no market in India<br />even for one and they would not be able to afford<br />bringing out more. Isn't that sad? I told them of<br />RKN's popularity abroad and perhaps it would be worth<br />marketing them here. But that needs lot of effort.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy and do share with us what you liked!!</p>

        <p>Sridhar, Alistair Maclean the author of the said<br />movies admitted that he wrote them for movies,<br />although he was a struggling writer early on and had<br />no idea how they would make it into movies.</p>
<p>I am not sure how we can define making a 'hash' of it<br />exactly, i mean to me it generally means 'sodhappal'<br />as acknoweldged by the author first and foremost. The<br />majority indian movies are that way. If an author says<br />his book has been murdered we have to respect that,<br />not jsut say it was a potboiler made well.</p>
<p>In addition to that it is sad for one thing our<br />devotion to potboilers itself and thinking movie<br />makers are doing a great job making them. That is<br />perhaps biggest reason why movies don't improve at<br />all.</p>

<p>  Rahul, there are many gray areas between what you<br />  call<br />  an 'art movie' and a total potboiler. Take Malgudi<br />  Days for instance (The tv serial). It was enjoyed by<br />  young and old, did complete justice to RK Narayan's<br />  original work and he acknowledged it himself, and<br />  yet<br />  had very few elements of a 'regular' tv serial - by<br />  that i mean loud music, dramatic story line, etc.</p>
<p>  The maker of Malgudi Days - Shankar Nag had a very<br />  difficult time convincing RK Narayan to sell the<br />  rights because of RKN's experience with Dev Anand's<br />  guide. Now if you think making 'cash registers ring'<br />  is something writers like, well not all writers are<br />  that way. RKN himself talks of Dev Anand approaching<br />  him with a blank cheque book for the rights of<br />  Guide.<br />  He took a small sum which Dev Anand himself said so<br />  and thought it was foolish, but he wanted the story<br />  to<br />  be picturised as much as true to the original. The<br />  result was a good potboiler but nothing like the<br />  original story. Rosie, the heroine, is a small time<br />  street dancer who makes it to the stage in local<br />  city.<br />  She does not fly in planes or wear make up or become<br />  a<br />  'big star'. The hero does not attract huge crowds or<br />  die melodramatically.</p>
<p>  To me it is like this - it takes some talent to make<br />  french fries well, does not make me a great cook if<br />  I<br />  do so. Potboilers are movies made solely for<br />  money,granted an entertaining potboiler, like TM for<br />  example is like eating a crisp bag of french fries,<br />  very nice at times. But not a well cooked, flavorful<br />  meal. And certainly if the author of the book<br />  deserves<br />  to have their comments valid, on whether it was done<br />  well or not.</p>

<p>    Malathi;     Making a pot boiler is also tough. Infact<br />  personally<br />    i feel making a pot<br />    boiler is tougher than making a movie which<br />  appeals<br />    to a select segment.<br />    When a film maker is making a choice between<br />  making<br />    a pot boiler to a "art"<br />    film he is actually choosing between making and<br />    loosing money.<br />    Also, dear Malathi, why should TM have been made<br />    into a film which appeals<br />    to a select sect of folk. If that had been the<br />  case<br />    i doubt whether i would<br />    have watched it, i hate such docu movies.</p>
<p>    Infact the very fact that PS appeals to all of us<br />  is<br />    because its a pot<br />    boiler (lets not even argue otherwise). Which is<br />    exactly why this group has<br />    been named after PonniyinSelvan and not Neelakanta<br />    Shastri's Colas! :) :)</p>
<p>    If a movie becomes as famous as the book or in<br />  some<br />    cases even more famous<br />    then we can say that a movie has been faithful to<br />    the book. Thats what<br />    matters in the end, doesn't it? Writers may feel<br />    otherwise but im sure they<br />    dont complain when the cash counters are ringing.</p>

<p>      Rahul, there are movies that have matched books<br />    - to<br />      give you a few examples Kill a Mockingbird,<br />  Color<br />      Purple, the televised version of Malgudi Days,<br />    several<br />      books by Agatha Christie and Charles Dickens.</p>
<p>      I agree with you, it is an extremely hard task<br />  and<br />      logistics are different. On the other hand, many<br />    film<br />      makers take the 'pot boiler' route very easily,<br />    just<br />      on the pretext that it is difficult and not<br />    consumable<br />      by masses. Read RK Narayan's comments on how<br />  Guide<br />    was<br />      made into a movie, it is quite enlightening.</p>
<p>      TM was a good potboiler at best, the book was a<br />    real<br />      thesis on classical music and dance, it could<br />  have<br />      been made into a movie but perhaps with limited<br />    mass<br />      appeal.</p>

<p>        I think, to be fair to the director, its hard<br />    for<br />        the movie to match the<br />        book.

Also the reader tends to ignore<br />  the<br />      some flaws (almost<br />      always present) in his favorite author's books<br />      whereas the movie goer shows<br />      his displeasure then and there<br />      (whistle,catcall,etc).</p>
<p>      I feel its a totally unfair comparision which we<br />      sometime take the liberty<br />      of doing.</p>

<p>        Don't mean to turn this into a debate ,but I<br />      disagree<br />        that TM was made into a great movie. You have<br />  to<br />      watch<br />        the movie after reading the book, not the<br />  other<br />      way.<br />        BTW the hero and heroine are in their early<br />      twenties<br />        in the book, if I remember right. Padmini<br />      especially<br />        was the best choice for the heroine given her<br />      dancing<br />        abilities but well past her prime, Sivaji did<br />  not<br />      look<br />        like 20+ either. The side casting was<br />  brilliant,<br />        especially Manorama and Nagesh.</p>
<p>        It is still a huge 'chicken and egg' type of<br />  deal<br />      -<br />        whether movies like this 'educate' masses on<br />      classical<br />        arts to the extent possible or dilute real<br />      classical<br />        art to mass consumption. Better to enjoy<br />      everything<br />        for what it is.</p>

<p>          Anyway, like so many others I have read the<br />      novel<br />          umpteen times and have always felt the movie<br />      never<br />          did justice to Kalaimani's writing. Hi This<br />          is a general sighing when great books are<br />  made<br />      into<br />          movies. It will not be possible for any<br />  director<br />      to<br />          bring the entire story, that too a 'thodar<br />      naval'<br />          into a 2/3 hr movie. I havent read TM, but<br />  the<br />      movie<br />          is so good that I would have watched that<br />  more<br />      than<br />          50 times, ( recently in ths SunTV). If you<br />  take<br />          Davinci code, it was not great movie,<br />  eventhough<br />      its<br />          director Ron Howard did his best to bring<br />  out<br />      all<br />          the scenes. But the performanc of the<br />  actors,<br />      mainly<br />          Tom hanks pulled the movie down unlike TM.<br />  by<br />      the<br />          by, there are some movies which will mach<br />  the<br />          reputation of the book or surpass that.

        <p>Sundar, who makes these classifications? And why is it<br />not possible to have a 'sappadu' that is a healthy<br />meal but perhaps with less french fries or none at<br />all?</p>
<p>Yes some of the movies you mentioned are potboilers,<br />and won oscars. Some of them like Benhur had books<br />also behind them. But not that many that I know of had<br />unhappy authors. Benhur's author was happy with how it<br />was made. You can also watch oscar winning movies like<br />Kill a mocking bird, Color purple etc where the<br />authors were very happy and the screenplay involved<br />them completely. In some cases such as Daphne Du<br />Maurier's Rebecca or Gone wiht the Wind the authors<br />just sell the rights and do not comment on the movie<br />at all. That has also happened.</p>
<p>Be it India or abroad we cannot take someone's work,<br />make it into a potboiler and say making a potboiler<br />takes talent, I don't care how the author feels about<br />it, the movie was a success etc. The author deserves a<br />say in how it was made, not all authors write purely<br />for money and not all audiences watch purely for<br />timepass.</p>

<p>  To me it is like this - it takes some talent to make<br />  french fries well, does not make me a great cook if<br />  I<br />  do so. Potboilers are movies made solely for<br />  money,granted an entertaining potboiler, like TM for<br />  example is like eating a crisp bag of french fries,<br />  very nice at times. But not a well cooked, flavorful<br />  meal. And certainly if the author of the book<br />  deserves<br />  to have their comments valid, on whether it was done<br />  well or not.</p>

        <p>Hi<br />kalki was very deeply involved in the day to day of these two movies. <br />visited all the shooting sites and wrote about them.<br />thiyagabhoomi was simultaneul released as a magazine serial when the <br />shootuing was taking place.<br />close circles do mention even amaradara was written as ascreen play <br />type rather than a novel.</p>

<p>  Sujatha said he took to screenplay writing as a<br />  profession itself to avoid producers murdering his<br />  stories. RKN sold Malgudi days after a great deal of<br />  reluctance after his experience with Guide, and only<br />  after he saw and approved two pilot episodes.</p>
<p>  JK's sila nerangilal...was a reasonably good movie,<br />  true to its story as far as I could see. No idea what<br />  he thought of it. There was one more JK story, same<br />  Lakshmi-Srikanth pair, name I forget. </p>
<p>  We cannot possibly compare writers like Subbu to<br />  writers like Sujatha(as far as movies go I mean).<br />  Writers like Subbu wrote for love of their art purely,<br />  money making secondary or perhaps none at all. Sujatha<br />  atleast later days ranks on par with Stephen King,<br />  Alistair Maclean etc, who wrote intentionally for<br />  potboiler movies, and in the process both movie maker<br />  and author went home with happy bank balance, and<br />  public with yet another time pass.</p>

<p>    i think a pattern would emerge if we find their<br />    reactions to movie <br />    making of books as well as their involvement in<br />    movie making.</p>

        <p>Venkat, I am not aware of kalki's involvement in<br />movies other than writing lyrics for Meera and<br />Thyagabhoomi later. could you say more?</p>
<p>Sujatha said he took to screenplay writing as a<br />profession itself to avoid producers murdering his<br />stories. RKN sold Malgudi days after a great deal of<br />reluctance after his experience with Guide, and only<br />after he saw and approved two pilot episodes.</p>
<p>JK's sila nerangilal...was a reasonably good movie,<br />true to its story as far as I could see. No idea what<br />he thought of it. There was one more JK story, same<br />Lakshmi-Srikanth pair, name I forget. </p>
<p>We cannot possibly compare writers like Subbu to<br />writers like Sujatha(as far as movies go I mean).<br />Writers like Subbu wrote for love of their art purely,<br />money making secondary or perhaps none at all. Sujatha<br />atleast later days ranks on par with Stephen King,<br />Alistair Maclean etc, who wrote intentionally for<br />potboiler movies, and in the process both movie maker<br />and author went home with happy bank balance, and<br />public with yet another time pass.</p>

        <p>Rahul, there are many gray areas between what you call<br />an 'art movie' and a total potboiler. Take Malgudi<br />Days for instance (The tv serial). It was enjoyed by<br />young and old, did complete justice to RK Narayan's<br />original work and he acknowledged it himself, and yet<br />had very few elements of a 'regular' tv serial - by<br />that i mean loud music, dramatic story line, etc.</p>
<p>The maker of Malgudi Days - Shankar Nag had a very<br />difficult time convincing RK Narayan to sell the<br />rights because of RKN's experience with Dev Anand's<br />guide. Now if you think making 'cash registers ring'<br />is something writers like, well not all writers are<br />that way. RKN himself talks of Dev Anand approaching<br />him with a blank cheque book for the rights of Guide.<br />He took a small sum which Dev Anand himself said so<br />and thought it was foolish, but he wanted the story to<br />be picturised as much as true to the original. The<br />result was a good potboiler but nothing like the<br />original story. Rosie, the heroine, is a small time<br />street dancer who makes it to the stage in local city.<br />She does not fly in planes or wear make up or become a<br />'big star'. The hero does not attract huge crowds or<br />die melodramatically.</p>
<p>To me it is like this - it takes some talent to make<br />french fries well, does not make me a great cook if I<br />do so. Potboilers are movies made solely for<br />money,granted an entertaining potboiler, like TM for<br />example is like eating a crisp bag of french fries,<br />very nice at times. But not a well cooked, flavorful<br />meal. And certainly if the author of the book deserves<br />to have their comments valid, on whether it was done<br />well or not.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Malathi;   Making a pot boiler is also tough. Infact personally<br />  i feel making a pot<br />  boiler is tougher than making a movie which appeals<br />  to a select segment.<br />  When a film maker is making a choice between making<br />  a pot boiler to a "art"<br />  film he is actually choosing between making and<br />  loosing money.<br />  Also, dear Malathi, why should TM have been made<br />  into a film which appeals<br />  to a select sect of folk. If that had been the case<br />  i doubt whether i would<br />  have watched it, i hate such docu movies.</p>
<p>  Infact the very fact that PS appeals to all of us is<br />  because its a pot<br />  boiler (lets not even argue otherwise). Which is<br />  exactly why this group has<br />  been named after PonniyinSelvan and not Neelakanta<br />  Shastri's Colas! :) :)</p>
<p>  If a movie becomes as famous as the book or in some<br />  cases even more famous<br />  then we can say that a movie has been faithful to<br />  the book. Thats what<br />  matters in the end, doesn't it? Writers may feel<br />  otherwise but im sure they<br />  dont complain when the cash counters are ringing.</p>

<p>    Rahul, there are movies that have matched books<br />  - to<br />    give you a few examples Kill a Mockingbird, Color<br />    Purple, the televised version of Malgudi Days,<br />  several<br />    books by Agatha Christie and Charles Dickens.</p>
<p>    I agree with you, it is an extremely hard task and<br />    logistics are different. On the other hand, many<br />  film<br />    makers take the 'pot boiler' route very easily,<br />  just<br />    on the pretext that it is difficult and not<br />  consumable<br />    by masses. Read RK Narayan's comments on how Guide<br />  was<br />    made into a movie, it is quite enlightening.</p>
<p>    TM was a good potboiler at best, the book was a<br />  real<br />    thesis on classical music and dance, it could have<br />    been made into a movie but perhaps with limited<br />  mass<br />    appeal.</p>

<p>      Hi;       I haven't read the book TM but have seen the<br />  movie a<br />      few times as my dad<br />      loves it (a Nagesh fan) and forces us to watch<br />  it<br />      also! Its a really nice<br />      movie.</p>
<p>      I think, to be fair to the director, its hard<br />  for<br />      the movie to match the<br />      book. For that matter any movie made from a book<br />      nearly always falls short<br />      of expectations. You can take age old examples<br />  to<br />      the present Harry<br />      Potter movies. The movies always fall short of<br />  the<br />      book.<br />      I think movie is a different medium and<br />  shouldn't be<br />      compared to the book. A<br />      movie at a single moment addresses more than 300<br />      individuals from all walks<br />      of life hence has to be made in that manner, in<br />      other words compromises are<br />      essential.<br />      A book on the other hand, addresses only one<br />  person<br />      at any given<br />      moment. There is always a common'ness about the<br />      individuals who buy that<br />      particular book. Also the reader tends to ignore<br />  the<br />      some flaws (almost<br />      always present) in his favorite author's books<br />      whereas the movie goer shows<br />      his displeasure then and there<br />      (whistle,catcall,etc).</p>
<p>      I feel its a totally unfair comparision which we<br />      sometime take the liberty<br />      of doing.</p>

<p>        Don't mean to turn this into a debate ,but I<br />      disagree<br />        that TM was made into a great movie. You have<br />  to<br />      watch<br />        the movie after reading the book, not the<br />  other<br />      way.<br />        BTW the hero and heroine are in their early<br />      twenties<br />        in the book, if I remember right. Padmini<br />      especially<br />        was the best choice for the heroine given her<br />      dancing<br />        abilities but well past her prime, Sivaji did<br />  not<br />      look<br />        like 20+ either. The side casting was<br />  brilliant,<br />        especially Manorama and Nagesh.</p>
<p>        It is still a huge 'chicken and egg' type of<br />  deal<br />      -<br />        whether movies like this 'educate' masses on<br />      classical<br />        arts to the extent possible or dilute real<br />      classical<br />        art to mass consumption. Better to enjoy<br />      everything<br />        for what it is.</p>

<p>          Anyway, like so many others I have read the<br />      novel<br />          umpteen times and have always felt the movie<br />      never<br />          did justice to Kalaimani's writing. Hi This<br />          is a general sighing when great books are<br />  made<br />      into<br />          movies. It will not be possible for any<br />  director<br />      to<br />          bring the entire story, that too a 'thodar<br />      naval'<br />          into a 2/3 hr movie. I havent read TM, but<br />  the<br />      movie<br />          is so good that I would have watched that<br />  more<br />      than<br />          50 times, ( recently in ths SunTV). If you<br />  take<br />          Davinci code, it was not great movie,<br />  eventhough<br />      its<br />          director Ron Howard did his best to bring<br />  out<br />      all<br />          the scenes. But the performanc of the<br />  actors,<br />      mainly<br />          Tom hanks pulled the movie down unlike TM.<br />  by<br />      the<br />          by, there are some movies which will mach<br />  the<br />          reputation of the book or surpass that.

        <p>-Well atleast sujatha went one step ahead and wrote directly for the <br />movies.</p>
<p>kalki, akilan, r.k narayan, jayakanthan, sujatha are some of the <br />authors whose published works were made into movies.<br />anybody I left out???</p>
<p>i think a pattern would emerge if we find their reactions to movie <br />making of books as well as their involvement in movie making.</p>
<p>kalki and sujatha were directly involved in movie making.<br />what about the rest? any ideas?</p>

        <p>Malathi; Making a pot boiler is also tough. Infact personally i feel making a pot<br />boiler is tougher than making a movie which appeals to a select segment.<br />When a film maker is making a choice between making a pot boiler to a "art"<br />film he is actually choosing between making and loosing money.<br />Also, dear Malathi, why should TM have been made into a film which appeals<br />to a select sect of folk. If that had been the case i doubt whether i would<br />have watched it, i hate such docu movies.</p>
<p>Infact the very fact that <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan" PS</acronym  appeals to all of us is because its a pot<br />boiler (lets not even argue otherwise). Which is exactly why this group has<br />been named after PonniyinSelvan and not Neelakanta Shastri's Colas! :) :)</acronym></p>
<p>If a movie becomes as famous as the book or in some cases even more famous<br />then we can say that a movie has been faithful to the book. Thats what<br />matters in the end, doesn't it? Writers may feel otherwise but im sure they<br />dont complain when the cash counters are ringing.</p>

<p>  I agree with you, it is an extremely hard task and<br />  logistics are different. On the other hand, many film<br />  makers take the 'pot boiler' route very easily, just<br />  on the pretext that it is difficult and not consumable<br />  by masses. Read RK Narayan's comments on how Guide was<br />  made into a movie, it is quite enlightening.</p>
<p>  TM was a good potboiler at best, the book was a real<br />  thesis on classical music and dance, it could have<br />  been made into a movie but perhaps with limited mass<br />  appeal.</p>

<p>    Hi;     I haven't read the book TM but have seen the movie a<br />    few times as my dad<br />    loves it (a Nagesh fan) and forces us to watch it<br />    also! Its a really nice<br />    movie.</p>
<p>    I think, to be fair to the director, its hard for<br />    the movie to match the<br />    book. For that matter any movie made from a book<br />    nearly always falls short<br />    of expectations. You can take age old examples to<br />    the present Harry<br />    Potter movies. The movies always fall short of the<br />    book.<br />    I think movie is a different medium and shouldn't be<br />    compared to the book. A<br />    movie at a single moment addresses more than 300<br />    individuals from all walks<br />    of life hence has to be made in that manner, in<br />    other words compromises are<br />    essential.<br />    A book on the other hand, addresses only one person<br />    at any given<br />    moment. There is always a common'ness about the<br />    individuals who buy that<br />    particular book. Also the reader tends to ignore the<br />    some flaws (almost<br />    always present) in his favorite author's books<br />    whereas the movie goer shows<br />    his displeasure then and there<br />    (whistle,catcall,etc).</p>
<p>    I feel its a totally unfair comparision which we<br />    sometime take the liberty<br />    of doing.</p>

<p>      Don't mean to turn this into a debate ,but I<br />    disagree<br />      that TM was made into a great movie. You have to<br />    watch<br />      the movie after reading the book, not the other<br />    way.<br />      BTW the hero and heroine are in their early<br />    twenties<br />      in the book, if I remember right. Padmini<br />    especially<br />      was the best choice for the heroine given her<br />    dancing<br />      abilities but well past her prime, Sivaji did not<br />    look<br />      like 20+ either. The side casting was brilliant,<br />      especially Manorama and Nagesh.</p>
<p>      It is still a huge 'chicken and egg' type of deal<br />    -<br />      whether movies like this 'educate' masses on<br />    classical<br />      arts to the extent possible or dilute real<br />    classical<br />      art to mass consumption.

<p>        Anyway, like so many others I have read the<br />    novel<br />        umpteen times and have always felt the movie<br />    never<br />        did justice to Kalaimani's writing. Hi This<br />        is a general sighing when great books are made<br />    into<br />        movies. It will not be possible for any director<br />    to<br />        bring the entire story, that too a 'thodar<br />    naval'<br />        into a 2/3 hr movie. I havent read TM, but the<br />    movie<br />        is so good that I would have watched that more<br />    than<br />        50 times, ( recently in ths SunTV). If you take<br />        Davinci code, it was not great movie, eventhough<br />    its<br />        director Ron Howard did his best to bring out<br />    all<br />        the scenes. But the performanc of the actors,<br />    mainly<br />        Tom hanks pulled the movie down unlike TM. by<br />    the<br />        by, there are some movies which will mach the<br />        reputation of the book or surpass that.

        <p>Rahul, there are movies that have matched books - to<br />give you a few examples Kill a Mockingbird, Color<br />Purple, the televised version of Malgudi Days, several<br />books by Agatha Christie and Charles Dickens.</p>
<p>I agree with you, it is an extremely hard task and<br />logistics are different. On the other hand, many film<br />makers take the 'pot boiler' route very easily, just<br />on the pretext that it is difficult and not consumable<br />by masses. Read RK Narayan's comments on how Guide was<br />made into a movie, it is quite enlightening.</p>
<p>TM was a good potboiler at best, the book was a real<br />thesis on classical music and dance, it could have<br />been made into a movie but perhaps with limited mass<br />appeal.</p>

<blockquote><p>  Hi;   I haven't read the book TM but have seen the movie a<br />  few times as my dad<br />  loves it (a Nagesh fan) and forces us to watch it<br />  also! Its a really nice<br />  movie.</p>
<p>  I think, to be fair to the director, its hard for<br />  the movie to match the<br />  book. For that matter any movie made from a book<br />  nearly always falls short<br />  of expectations. You can take age old examples to<br />  the present Harry<br />  Potter movies. The movies always fall short of the<br />  book.<br />  I think movie is a different medium and shouldn't be<br />  compared to the book. A<br />  movie at a single moment addresses more than 300<br />  individuals from all walks<br />  of life hence has to be made in that manner, in<br />  other words compromises are<br />  essential.<br />  A book on the other hand, addresses only one person<br />  at any given<br />  moment. There is always a common'ness about the<br />  individuals who buy that<br />  particular book. Also the reader tends to ignore the<br />  some flaws (almost<br />  always present) in his favorite author's books<br />  whereas the movie goer shows<br />  his displeasure then and there<br />  (whistle,catcall,etc).</p>
<p>  I feel its a totally unfair comparision which we<br />  sometime take the liberty<br />  of doing.</p>

        <p>Also on the same lines very few books have been made<br />into good movies, the true test of that is when the<br />book writer acknowledges that it is so. 'To kill a<br />mockingbird' is one of the few movies that has been<br />acknowledged this way. </p>
<p>'Gone with the wind' same on the lines of Dr Zhivago<br />is a nice movie but very pale in comparison with the<br />book. Guns of Navarone etc are potboilers, not<br />classics, they are written probably with intention<br />that someone will make movies out of them.</p>
<p>R K Narayan was horrified at how his Guide was made<br />into a movie - Guide is a small book that too, not a<br />sweeping novel. It could have been made into a movie,<br />RKN disliked the glamor that Dev Anand introduced that<br />took away the simplicity of the book and his writing.<br />He writes two chapters of this in 'My Days', well<br />worth reading to see how world of movies operates!!<br />BTW Guide, like TM is a good 'commercial' movie with<br />great music and good performances by Waheeda Rehman.<br />Just like TM, don't compare it to the book that is<br />all.</p>

If you take<br />    Davinci code, it was not great movie, eventhough<br />  its<br />    director Ron Howard did his best to bring out all<br />    the scenes.

        <p>Hi </p>
<p>the old bound books of the story serials also offer us an insight <br />into the living those times.</p>
<p>a couple of years back we did run a discussion on the advertisements <br />in ponniyin selvan serial in kalki magazines.<br />in particular there was a discussin on the cosmetic " snow" which i <br />presume is something like vaseline which frequently appeared in <br />advertisements of that period.</p>
<p>the original bound volumes are very valuble too i am told. the 1949- <br />54 version of ponniyin selvan is supposed to fetch upto 25000 rs. we <br />happened to see one in kumbakonam during a group tour with our friend <br />seetharaman.</p>
<p>i was lucky enough to be presented by a gentle man ( on our first <br />meeting) a first edition of sivakaamiyin sabatham.<br />in it is an appeal by kalki to MRs bharathi to accept the money the <br />magazine collected for her. he says its a gift for a " guru pathini"<br />it was surprisingly during the time kalki was refuting the mahakavi <br />title for bharathi.<br />venketesh</p>

<p>  I am presently scanning one of my father's bound<br />  collection - Lakshmi's Kanjanayin Kanavu (1947). In<br />  the process I found several jokes and ads from AV of<br />  those days. I will post the ads here perhaps over<br />  weekend. </p>

<p>    My mom has a bound version of Thillana Mohanambal.<br />    In fact her collection is<br />    awesome. I still remember her religiously tear off<br />    all the "Thodar Kadhai"<br />    from all the Tamizh weekly. My dad use to subscribe<br />    for all them all. Once<br />    the story is over she would bind them and number<br />    them. She considers her<br />    personal library more precious than anything else</p>

<p>        Hi<br />        in my humble opinion konar notes has done more<br />    'sEvai" to tamil<br />        learning than all poets writers and tamil<br />    liguistic piriyarkal.</p>
<p>        forget the notes, but the fundamentals that<br />    tamil could be more<br />        simpler and accesible to the common man( read<br />    the poor student<br />        here)it self was a releif.</p>
<p>        venketesh</p>
<p>      dear venkat</p>
<p>      i would differ on that, even though the concept<br />    was god send - i<br />      think the whole curriculum is ...... more with an<br />    aim to cram and<br />      pass the exam - which unfortunately was ( is) how<br />    students see the<br />      exam. it is refreshing for eg, when we see how the<br />    curriculum for<br />      the local schools in singapore is - its more hands<br />    on, instead of<br />      read / memorise - the focus is on fundamentals and<br />    understanding.<br />      frankly tamil was a more dreaded subject to me<br />    than even maths. it<br />      was a chore even to read the text let alone look<br />    outside...so at<br />      that time the notes were best - mug /vomit...fill<br />    it shut it forget<br />      it. ( the best part was i still remember - they<br />    were passed on from<br />      hand to hand - so cant even call it second<br />    hand...and i still<br />      remember mine was a full 8 year old book.....)<br />    nothing changed...the<br />      questions remained the same ( maybe the guys<br />    setting the papers<br />      refered to the notes as well)....so easiest was to<br />    skip ( sleep) all<br />      tamil class - take last 5 years paper and you<br />    could work out 10<br />      questions and ( no need to even catch the ant....)<br />    - you had almost<br />      80% of the possible question paper on hand. i was<br />    a past expert at<br />      this form of divining...</p>
<p>      while on the subject, my english teacher was smart<br />    - she would<br />      prepare us for the larger goals at hand - her<br />    monthly test were very<br />      simple - 2 questions - 50 marks each....simple<br />    questions but aimed<br />      at bringing out the best in you in form of command<br />    over the<br />      language...she used to push us to read a lot of<br />    other texts/novels (<br />      hardy boys, secret seven, famous five, nancy drew<br />    included)...</p>
<p>      it stood us good steed, when we worked on<br />    professional exams -<br />      infact our proffessors would encourage open book<br />    exams - believe me<br />      they are the toughest...</p>
<p>      that why now in hindsight, i blame the system for<br />    not instigating a<br />      love for the language...which could have been so<br />    easy for something<br />      as divine as tamil.....instead the notes, gave an<br />    easy escape route.<br />      we won the war but lost the battle..</p>

<p>Anyway, like so many others I have read the novel umpteen times and have always felt the movie never did justice to Kalaimani's writing. Hi This is a general sighing when great books are made into movies. It will not be possible for any director to bring the entire story, that too a 'thodar naval' into a 2/3 hr movie. I havent read TM, but the movie is so good that I would have watched that more than 50 times, ( recently in ths SunTV). If you take Davinci code, it was not great movie, eventhough its director Ron Howard did his best to bring out all the scenes. But the performanc of the actors, mainly Tom hanks pulled the movie down unlike TM. by the by, there are some movies which will mach the reputation of the book or surpass that.

</p><p>&nbsp;<br <br />Hi all,<br <br />&nbsp;<br <br />I have said in my previous post that I had purchased TM by Palaniappa Bros.a few years ago and still possess it, but like many of my posts in this forum it has been drowned by an avalanche of responses (at least four per person at one time). I am wondering whether there's any point in me remaining a member of this forum which has been hijacked by a few members.<br <br />&nbsp;<br <br />Anyway, like so many others I have read the novel umpteen times and have always felt the movie never did justice to Kalaimani's writing. For example the character of mattalakkara varadan is very well etched in the novel by inthe movie it has made inti a miniscule one and played by TRRamachandran.<br <br />&nbsp;<br <br />But the choice of Saraswati for vadivambal is spot on. Vadivambal is one ofthe greatest characters in Tamil<br <br />novels, and Savadal Vaithy (played by Nagesh) meets his match in her. <br <br />&nbsp;<br <br />&nbsp;<br <br />&nbsp;<br <br />&nbsp;<br <br />&nbsp;<br <br />&nbsp;<br <br />&nbsp;<br <br />&nbsp;<br <br /><br <br &nbsp;<br <br />

<p>Mr. Vishwanathan s/o kothamangkalam subbu also mentioned that they <br />were on the look out for some of his father's writings which were <br />missing.</p>

<p>  Already Vikatan has published 5 of his works..<br />  rAobahadhUr SingAram, pandhanallUr bAmA, manji virattu, miss rAdhA,<br />  and gAndhi mahAn kadhaigaL. In fact I was told that TM would almost <br />  certainly be the next one. So if you wait a little, you can buy TM<br />  from AV ! </p>

<p>    Hello, am wondering if anyone has read the original book by <br />    Kothamangalam Subbu. Sadly it is out of print but old ananda <br />vikatan <br />    bound volumes may be available in some people's homes. Lot of <br />people <br />    do not even know this classic was a book, story serialised in AV, <br />and <br />    with really nice pictures by Gopulu. It was very difficult to <br />treat <br />    with complex descriptions of intricacies of music and dance, I <br />got <br />    through two chapters with great difficulty with my grandmother's <br />aid. <br />    Would love to read it again but unfortunately I don't think it is <br />    available.</p>
<p>    The movie was also good but very commerialised version of the <br />story <br />    with much older actors. </p>
<p>    If anyone knows more would be glad to know!!</p>

        <p>It is my understanding ( gained from Kothamangalam Subbu's daughter)<br />that Vikatan has agreed to bring out ALL of his works (including his <br />poems which were never published ) ..in many volumes.. very soon. </p>
<p>Already Vikatan has published 5 of his works..<br />rAobahadhUr SingAram, pandhanallUr bAmA, manji virattu, miss rAdhA,<br />and gAndhi mahAn kadhaigaL. In fact I was told that TM would almost <br />certainly be the next one. So if you wait a little, you can buy TM<br />from AV ! </p>

Sadly it is out of print but old ananda vikatan <br />  bound volumes may be available in some people's homes. Lot of people <br />  do not even know this classic was a book, story serialised in AV, and <br />  with really nice pictures by Gopulu. It was very difficult to treat <br />  with complex descriptions of intricacies of music and dance, I got <br />  through two chapters with great difficulty with my grandmother's aid. <br />  Would love to read it again but unfortunately I don't think it is <br />  available.</p>
<p>  The movie was also good but very commerialised version of the story <br />  with much older actors. </p>
<p>  If anyone knows more would be glad to know!!</p>

        <p>There are lot of treasure book stalls in chennai, we call them second<br />hand book stalls and others are lending library. I have seen<br />Triplicane beach side book stalls, Luz corner book stalls and another<br />one near Mount Road and Higginbothoms, I hope the book stall is still<br />there which is small where I used to buy computer books. All these<br />second hand book stalls are treasures, if you visit once in a while<br />and buy, then you can have a little library. Other man's waste our<br />treasure :-)</p>
<p>My brother used to buy Kumudam and other weekly books specifically to<br />extract Sandilyan novel episodes and bind them.</p>

        <p>Thanks Udanx, that is good to know!! Paper preceding<br />year 2000 was made with acid and rarely outlasts 60-70<br />years even if preserved extremely well. Have you<br />considered scanning some of your mother's collections?<br />I know it is against copyright laws to sell it but if<br />we keep it personally some day it will be precious<br />source of bygone days. </p>
<p>I am presently scanning one of my father's bound<br />collection - Lakshmi's Kanjanayin Kanavu (1947). In<br />the process I found several jokes and ads from AV of<br />those days. I will post the ads here perhaps over<br />weekend. </p>

<p>      forget the notes, but the fundamentals that<br />  tamil could be more<br />      simpler and accesible to the common man( read<br />  the poor student<br />      here)it self was a releif.</p>

<p>    dear venkat</p>
<p>    i would differ on that, even though the concept<br />  was god send - i<br />    think the whole curriculum is ...... more with an<br />  aim to cram and<br />    pass the exam - which unfortunately was ( is) how<br />  students see the<br />    exam. it is refreshing for eg, when we see how the<br />  curriculum for<br />    the local schools in singapore is - its more hands<br />  on, instead of<br />    read / memorise - the focus is on fundamentals and<br />  understanding.<br />    frankly tamil was a more dreaded subject to me<br />  than even maths. it<br />    was a chore even to read the text let alone look<br />  outside...so at<br />    that time the notes were best - mug /vomit...fill<br />  it shut it forget<br />    it. ( the best part was i still remember - they<br />  were passed on from<br />    hand to hand - so cant even call it second<br />  hand...and i still<br />    remember mine was a full 8 year old book.....)<br />  nothing changed...the<br />    questions remained the same ( maybe the guys<br />  setting the papers<br />    refered to the notes as well)....so easiest was to<br />  skip ( sleep) all<br />    tamil class - take last 5 years paper and you<br />  could work out 10<br />    questions and ( no need to even catch the ant....)<br />  - you had almost<br />    80% of the possible question paper on hand. i was<br />  a past expert at<br />    this form of divining...</p>
<p>    while on the subject, my english teacher was smart<br />  - she would<br />    prepare us for the larger goals at hand - her<br />  monthly test were very<br />    simple - 2 questions - 50 marks each....simple<br />  questions but aimed<br />    at bringing out the best in you in form of command<br />  over the<br />    language...she used to push us to read a lot of<br />  other texts/novels (<br />    hardy boys, secret seven, famous five, nancy drew<br />  included)...</p>
<p>    it stood us good steed, when we worked on<br />  professional exams -<br />    infact our proffessors would encourage open book<br />  exams - believe me<br />    they are the toughest...</p>
<p>    that why now in hindsight, i blame the system for<br />  not instigating a<br />    love for the language...which could have been so<br />  easy for something<br />    as divine as tamil.....instead the notes, gave an<br />  easy escape route.<br />    we won the war but lost the battle..</p>

( how beatiful Mohana looks) is a treasure, but since AV does not do any reruns of novels serialised , you do not get a good set of bound volumes. The paper is brittle &amp; the volumes are dog earred etc. After a lot of hunting I settled down for the Palaniappa edition </P <br /></p><P :(</P <br /></p><P If you stay long enough in Chennai you can borrow from a lending library &amp; enjoy TM along with Gopulu's pics.</P <br /></p><P Shobha<BR <BR --- On <B Wed, 4/23/08, dmaloo <I &lt;dmaloo@yahoo.com&gt;</I </B  wrote:<BR </P <br /><BLOCKQUOTE style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid" From: dmaloo &lt;dmaloo@yahoo.com&gt;<BR Subject: [ponniyinselvan] Thillana Mohanambal<BR To: ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com<BR Date: Wednesday, April 23, 2008, 4:48 PM<BR <BR </p>
<PRE Hello, am wondering if anyone has read the original book by <br />Kothamangalam Subbu. Sadly it is out of print but old ananda vikatan <br />bound volumes may be available in some people's homes. Lot of people <br />do not even know this classic was a book, story serialised in AV, and <br />with really nice pictures by Gopulu. It was very difficult to treat <br />with complex descriptions of intricacies of music and dance, I got <br />through two chapters with great difficulty with my grandmother's aid. <br />Would love to read it again but unfortunately I don't think it is <br />available.<br /><br />The movie was also good but very commerialised version of the story <br />with much older actors. <br /><br />If anyone knows more would be glad to know!!<br /><br />Malathi<br /><br /><br />------------------------------------<br /><br />Yahoo!

<p>In CITY with skyrocketing prices, Personal Libraries are becoming <br />PRIMARY CASUALITIES ..</p>

<p>Hi venkat,</p>
<p>Thats the whole point.. passing an exam that is structured to test <br />your ability to memorise rather than understanding of the <br />language..so instead of leaving lasting impression on you it leaves <br />a lasting scar....leave alone avid writers like you - how many of us <br />can write a para in tamil - not talking of spellings here ( never <br />got the rendu suzhi, moonu suzhi right)... by a para i mean can they <br />write abstract / not even verse something of their own, be it just <br />their thoughts, comments - is there any free thought that occurs <br />amongst your millions </p>
<p>... take a look at our colleges - hardly anyone inside ( talking of <br />the BA, Bcom, BSc stuff) - why because it doesnt make any sense to <br />be inside - to pass and get a first class - all you need is a <br />dedicated week of cramming.</p>
<p>this coupled with the fact that in most english medium schools ( <br />incl mine) students are caned if they are caught conversing in <br />tamil...</p>
<p>parents - know a lot of them who consiously talk in english ( the <br />nuni nakku variety) to get their kids to ape....</p>
<p>so the brains are being consiously programmed to think in english - <br />and what little tamil comes out in written form is actually thought <br />of in english and then translated ( sometimes using madras univ <br />lexicons.....) into tamil. </p>
<p>what is thought in our schools and colleges as tamil is just a <br />miniscule percentage of what is there ( maybe a few kurals, a few <br />poems), from that only a minute miniscule is tested, of that a <br />further fraction is retained. </p>
<p>have nothing wrong in developing english skills - they are survival <br />skills - but that neednt come at the expense of your mother <br />tongue..especially one that is so classy likes ours.</p>

<p>This is going more towards the education system in India. Can it be<br />continued in this thread OR shall we branch it out separately.</p>
<p>Malathi,</p>
<p>My mom has a bound version of Thillana Mohanambal. In fact her collection is<br />awesome. I still remember her religiously tear off all the "Thodar Kadhai"<br />from all the Tamizh weekly. My dad use to subscribe for all them all. Once<br />the story is over she would bind them and number them. She considers her<br />personal library more precious than anything else</p>

        <p>Hi<br />in my humble opinion konar notes has done more 'sEvai" to tamil <br />learning than all poets writers and tamil liguistic piriyarkal.</p>
<p>forget the notes, but the fundamentals that tamil could be more <br />simpler and accesible to the common man( read the poor student <br />here)it self was a releif.</p>

<p>    bound volumes may be available in some people's<br />    homes. Lot of <br />    people <br />      do not even know this classic was a book, story<br />    serialised in AV, <br />    and <br />      with really nice pictures by Gopulu. It was very<br />    difficult to treat <br />      with complex descriptions of intricacies of music<br />    and dance, I got <br />      through two chapters with great difficulty with my<br />    grandmother's <br />    aid. <br />      Would love to read it again but unfortunately I<br />    don't think it is <br />      available.</p>
<p>      The movie was also good but very commerialised<br />    version of the story <br />      with much older actors. </p>
