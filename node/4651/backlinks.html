<p>Interactions of the Chola empire in the Chao Phraya Delta </p>
<p>G.Deivanayagam [also in PDF]<br />Tamil University, Thanjavur</p>
<p>Abstract: The Chola Empire of South India (9th to 12th C.AD ) was in <br />a position to establish strong contracts with the delta of <br />Chao_Phraya Chao Phraya River of Thailand in the medieval period. <br />They have very well established this contract by Diplomatic trade <br />and religious means. The impact of this South Indian Empire caused a <br />considerable effect in the Customs, Manners, Religious practices, <br />Place names art forms and Architecture etc of the Thais for example <br />the former name of Bangkok, Krungthep is nothing but Kuranguthope of <br />Tamil means the "Monkey's forest". In the close proximity, at Bujung <br />valley of Malaysia, there was establishment of Cholas in this <br />period, which is very well connected with this delta and <br />gives "Siva, Vishnu, Thiruppavai, Mulaipali, etc., and enhances the <br />intrinsic culture and art forms of Thailand. This paper will deal <br />with all these facets and gives substantial conclusions on the <br />history of Thai arts and Religion.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-----------</p>
<p>1 Introduction</p>
<p>The Chola country of South India and the Siam (Thailand) of <br />Indochina are located in the same latitude. The Chola country, the <br />east cost part in the Peninsular India is facing the Chao-Phraya <br />Delta of Siam through Bay of Bengal. Almost similar landscape, <br />climate, flora and fauna are seen on either sides in the Chao-Phraya <br />Delta and of the Kavery Delta. Although differed in physiological <br />forms as Dravidian and Mongoloid, the behavioural pattern of both <br />the Tamils and Thais are identical. Their food stuffs, preparations, <br />manners and customs, ceremonies and rituals, culture and psychology <br />are analogous.</p>
<p>A cultural unity is visible amidst the linguistic and physiological <br />diversity between these two different distant parts of Asia and <br />ethnic groups. How have these similarities or cultural unities <br />happened between South India and Siam? A thorough probing reveals <br />enormous facts and explores hundreds of evidences in the Chao Phraya <br />Delta.</p>
<p>2 Early contacts</p>
<p>Accordingly one may assume the trade contact of these two countries <br />even in the Pre- Christian era along with the Ptolemy and Periplus <br />references, sea trade was flourishing in that early period in the <br />ancient port cities of the Chola’s Kaveripumpattinam, Nagappattinam <br />&amp; Puducherry, with both east &amp; west. The commercial trade contacts <br />between South India and Siam were very well established from Pallava <br />period of 6th A.D.</p>
<p>Before 12th C.A.D. the present day Thailand was longitudinally <br />divided in two halves and ruled by Combodian khmers and Mons of <br />Burma. The Combodia, Burma, Malay Peninsula like south east Asian <br />countries were all well influenced by the South Indian culture and <br />trade in these periods. The close proximity of South Indian port <br />cities like Mahabalipuram, Puducheri, Kaverippumpattinam, <br />Nagappattinam etc. with Malaya, Kedah, Combodia promoted not only <br />the trade but also the culture of these Mon-Khmers, who are with no <br />doubt the forefathers of the Thais. Hence the Thais of Swarnabhumi <br />were not reluctant in accepting the culture of their forefathers, <br />Mon-Khmers, who were very much Indian Brahmanical. Since these Mons <br />and Khmers were able to cover the lower and middle parts of the <br />Siam, this cultural diffusion reached only in these two parts which <br />received many changes in the course of time, rather than the <br />northern part which received this influence after a long time.</p>
<p>3 Cultural similarities</p>
<p>Inscriptions</p>
<p>The earliest inscriptions numbering more than 200, of all south east <br />Asian countries are all of Sanskrit language written in Grantha <br />script, a common script between Sanskrit and Tamil , which <br />originated in the Pallava period in the Chola country by the <br />Brahmins. No other scripts has been discovered so far. This <br />professes the impact of the Chola country on South east Asian <br />countries in the early period (Chabra 1965; 72-76)</p>
<p>Three Grantha inscriptions of 5th C.A.D. and two of 6th C.A.D. at <br />Kuanlukput , one 7th C.A.D. inscriptions and one of 8th C.A.D. at <br />Nakhon si Thammarad were discovered so far which are all in the <br />southern part of Siam only that is in the Chao-Phraya Delta.</p>
<p>A 5th C.A.D. Sanskrit inscription discovered from «Sithep» of Siam <br />is displayed at Bangkok Museum. Such inscriptions seen at wat <br />Maheyang and Sonkai valley, explains the impact of South Indian <br />Sanscrit in Siam. Since the early scripts used in these countries <br />are all « Grantha». Almost all the scripts of these countries of <br />Indo-China are formulated in an analogous form with Grantha <br />and «Thai» is the typical example for that. The flowing and cursive <br />nature of these scripts proves it.</p>
<p>TAKUA-PA TAMIL INSCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>Above all an important Tamil inscription was found at the Wat <br />Naramiang temple of Takua-pa which confirms the permanent <br />settlements of the Tamils in Chao-Phraya Delta. This inscription <br />reads as follows:</p>
<p>«…(5) Varman Ku (na) … Manthan Naankuurula Yaa(n) Thotta Kulam per <br />Siri Avani Naranam Manikkramatharkkum Sena Muhatarkum Patharkum <br />Adaikalam».</p>
<p>Tamil merchant named…Manthan dug one tank (for the Domestic purpose <br />of) by the name of Shri.Avani Naranam (which was) handed over for <br />custody (for it’s protection) to the people of the concerned <br />settlement Manik Kramam, Senamuham and Devotees. (Kongknew <br />Veeraprajeck :1986 : 7-20).</p>
<p>TAMIL SETTLEMENTS IN SIAM</p>
<p>The inference from this inscription gives a clear and vivid account <br />of the influence of the Chola country in Chao-Phraya Delta. They <br />were not only well settled with all domestic comforts but also with <br />religious provisions in this distant place.</p>
<p>This researcher consider that digging that tank happened in a later <br />period in that Tamil merchant settlement called Avani Narana <br />Manikkramam which was a vaishnavite above where there was a temple <br />for Vishnu was already existing. Since the inhabitants of this <br />settlement are all very rich traders living with invaluable riches, <br />the entire settlement was well protected by the armed forces called <br />Senamugam. These residents were all staunch Vaishnavites and <br />devotees. Therefore the new comer … Manthan from Naankur in the <br />Chola country, which was also a Chola’s port town near to «Puhar», <br />who earned well after having connection with this «Avani Naranam», <br />decided to dig this temple tank in gratitude.</p>
<p>PEY WORSHIP</p>
<p>The worship of Karaikal Ammaiyar or Peyar is a typical identical and <br />unique religious practice of the trader community of Chola country. <br />This Peyar was a pious lady of this trader community connected with <br />Siva worship celebrated for her chastity depicted in the form of a <br />skeleton along with the image of dancing Siva. Such a Siva panel <br />along with Karaikal Ammaiyar is found at Pimay, and in the <br />triangular pediment of the eastern façade of the Phnam Rung Siva <br />temple of North east Siam. The image of teaching Siva-Dakshinamurthy <br />is also found in this temple.</p>
<p>SAIVISM</p>
<p>The great number of Sivalinga discovered so far in Siam tells the <br />influence of Siavism in Siam in 5th C. and after. The findings <br />of «Muha lingas» prooves that there was a great impact of Saivismin <br />Siam in Pallava period. An image of Siva with five heads and Ten <br />hands is displayed at the Museum of Ayutthaya. Dancing Siva with <br />ornaments is seen at Kut Suen Teng temple. Three Brahmin temples <br />were discovered at Negara Se Thamma Raja. They are of Brick <br />structures dating to 11th C. AD(Stanley O’connor : 19 : 1-22). In <br />the eastern faç ade of the Pimay Buddhist temple an image of Rishaba <br />Vahana Siva in seen. Images of Siva, Uma and Yama were discovered at <br />Woa Daeng cave and Prasat Hin ??" Nong Hong of North East Siam. Tjhey <br />belong to 11th C.A.D. and of Chola in style. It is being confirmed <br />by the Siva of Viengsra.</p>
<p>The practice of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai in Siam is an another <br />evidence of the interaction of the Cholas. The Thais are in general <br />familiar with Pranava and Panchatchara that is Om and Namasivaya.</p>
<p>IMPACT OF AGAMAS</p>
<p>Cholas were following the Agama tradition in their temple rituals <br />and chanting the Thevaram, Thiruvasagam, Thiruvempavai and <br />Thiruppavai and Nalayera Thivya Prabantham in temples. Similar <br />practices are found in Siam, should have been by the interactions of <br />the Cholas.</p>
<p>VAISHNAVISM</p>
<p>In 1902 W.Walter Bourke has found out the sculptures of Brahma, <br />Vishmu and Siva on the banks of river Takua Pah at Koupra Narai and <br />declared about the influence of south india over Siam. Vishnu images <br />were found out from Nakhon Sithammarat, Pimay, Bangkok, Cayya, Takua <br />Pah, OCEO, Phetburi etc. According to Pier Dewpond the Takua Pah <br />Vishnu is belongs to Chola style. Almost all the Icnographic details <br />of the available Vishnu images at Siam implies the influence of the <br />Pallava style. This researcher has studied some of the Buddhist <br />images of Sukkhothai and Ayutthaya collection and came to the <br />conclusion that: a) Some of them were moulded by the Chola sculptors <br />at Siam in Tanjorian style.</p>
<p>b) Some of them were costed at Thanjavur, Nagappattinam and brought <br />to Siam either to their own settlements or to the Thai public or <br />royalty. Prince Chand Chirayu Rajani, in his book entitled «Thai <br />imageries of Swarnabhumi Art» mentioned about my view points. The <br />area of ‘Sitep’ should have been a strong hold of Vaishnavism and of <br />Indian settlement in Pallava and Chola period. Stanely O’Connor <br />considers that the ancient architectural and archaeological findings <br />of Thailand dating from 5th to 9th C.A.D. are all Brahmanical and of <br />South India. They are of either late Pallava or early Chola in <br />style. The reclining image of Vishnu, Govarthana lila are also <br />identified at a dilabitated temple in the eastern part of Thailand. <br />One Bairava sculpture of Viang Sira confirms the Indian or Brahmin <br />towns formed in Siam in those period.</p>
<p>TAMIL BUDDHISM ??" THAI BUDDHISM</p>
<p>This iconographical, religious and cultural influence of the Cholas <br />over Thailand was reflected in Thai Buddhism also. Experts used to <br />classify the Thai Buddhist Bronzes mainly into two categories. They <br />are</p>
<p>1) Pallavanised and 2) Cholified ones.</p>
<p>In cholification the «Nagappattinam bronze casting» technique <br />(Tanjorian) was highly appreciated and adopted by the Thais.</p>
<p>RELIGION &amp; PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>The South Indian philosophy of Hinduism and Buddhism which were <br />prevailing in the Chola period were also being adopted by the <br />Siamese which are clearly referred by Pre Rup Stele Inscription and <br />Prasat Kok Po inscriptions. The South Indian Buddhist Monks like <br />Vinita Ruci and Vajrabodhi spreaded Buddhism of Chola country in <br />Siam, Vietnam and Laos.</p>
<p>RAMAYANA</p>
<p>Another strong proof of Cholas interaction in Siam is Ramayana. The <br />Ramakian practised by the Thais are analogous to Cholas Kamba <br />Ramayanam only and the Mayil Ravanan story is also of South India <br />(Mayirab Story).</p>
<p>There are 21 similarities found between Kamba Ramayanan and <br />Ramakian. For example the love at first sight between Phra Ram and <br />Nangsidha.</p>
<p>The Ramayana sculptures of Lobpuri temple wall and of Pimay Buddha <br />temple depicting the epic with flying Hanuman with Sanjeevi hill, <br />the fainted Lakhsmana, Building the Sethu bridge by the Monkeys, <br />nose cut of Surpanaka, defeat of Vali etc. The word «Ramakien» is <br />only a corrupt form of «Rama Kirthi».</p>
<p>THIRUPPAVAI - THIRUVEMPAVAI</p>
<p>Chanting of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai by the Thai Brahmins were <br />also introduced into Thailand by the Cholas only. Some of the <br />Thevaram like «Mattitta Punnayang Kanal» etc. and Thivya Prapandham <br />like. ‘Thiru Valuthi Natennum’, «Uyarvara Uyarnalam Udaiyavan» etc <br />are also being mixed in their chanting. They are quite familiar with <br />Thiruchitrambalam, Narayaname and Namasivaya. This author was able <br />to see same Tamil leaf also in the Grantha Palm leaf manuscripts <br />kept by the Thai Brahmans, which reveals that Tamil was familiar <br />with the Thai Brahmans in Chola period. They were well versed in <br />Grantha also. But nowadays without knowing the script and the <br />meaning, the phonemes were written in Thai script in a corrupt form <br />and they are chanted.</p>
<p>Hindu customs and rituals were followed by Thai royalty even in <br />their coronation ceremony.</p>
<p>GARUDA</p>
<p>The image of Garudantika the flying Kite man carrying Vishnu on his <br />shoulder is familiar with Thailand. (Bangkok Emerald Buddha temple, <br />Pimay Buddha temple, etc.) G.Deivanayagam The Chola Empire and the <br />Chao Phraya Delta</p>
<p>The Chao Phraya Delta: Historical Development, Dynamics and <br />Challenges of Thailand' Rice Bowl 6</p>
<p>VISHNU AND RAJA</p>
<p>The reclaiming Vishnu is identical with Chola country is found in <br />Siam. Vishnu with two consorts is a Chola’s production which is <br />being seen in Siam. They are Lakshmi and Pudevi. Pudevi is <br />considered or treated as Maheswari by the Siamese.</p>
<p>The Hari-hara (Half Vishnu ??" Half Siva) is flourished among South <br />Indian smartha Brahmins. The very same practice was in existence at <br />Siam even in 7th C.A.D. when Esana Varman was ruling Siam. There is <br />a great saying among the Cholas as follows. «Seeing the king is <br />seeing the Vishnu» The same concept is seen at Siam. King <br />Ramathipaty who established the Ayutthaya kingdom calling himself as <br />Narayana ??" Nara, and ordered for a full fledged annual ceremony in <br />the Nagara Sri Thammarat.</p>
<p>THE BRAHMAN TEMPLES</p>
<p>In the Thai Brahman temple complex of Bangkok a Ganesh temple, Siva <br />temple and a Vishnu temple are Seen. This Vishnu is being named as <br />Sugothaya Perumal, typical Tamil name, Sugothayam is the former name <br />of the Thailand. This name consists of two syllables Suga + Uthayam <br />that is the «Pleasant dawn». Like Korea the land of morning calm, <br />Thailand was treated by the Cholas as a land of «Pleasant dawn».</p>
<p>SWINGS</p>
<p>The ‘Great Swings’ seen in Thai Brahmin temples and the Swing <br />festivals (Login wor) are all of South Indian tradition only.</p>
<p>PAVAAI</p>
<p>The «Paavai Nonbu» (December and January) was familiar with the <br />Thais until 1940. Nowadays it has been reduced to a temple ritual.</p>
<p>RAIN FESTIVAL</p>
<p>The rain festival and the Mantra Chanting that time are all of Tamil <br />in tradition. It affirms the loyalty of the people to the king <br />as «We serve you not only today; but for forth coming 7 births also.</p>
<p>DEEPAWALI &amp; KARTHIKAI</p>
<p>Deepavali and Karthikai festivals were also introduced by the Cholas <br />in Siam. The Karthikai festival is being celebrated as «Malai» <br />(Thiruvannamalai fire festival) by the Thais. The float festivals of <br />Thais are also similar with the Tamil Cholas.</p>
<p>THE THAI CHOLAS</p>
<p>«The kings of Ayutthaya were proud to call themselves as Cholas» <br />(Paul Pelliot ??" ‘Encore A Propos Des Voyages De Tcheng Howo’ <br />Toungpao 1936). The story of the Manu neethi Chola was familiar <br />among Sugothays and king Ramakongheng had installed a bell for the <br />public call for justice. (David K.Wyatt 1984 : 54)</p>
<p>TAMILS AND TAMIL IN THAILAND</p>
<p>The Tamil people migrated to Siam in the Chola period, slowly lost <br />their language and culture and mingled with the Thais. But one can <br />see the Physiological features of this Chola Thais from the <br />Mongoloid Thai natives.</p>
<p>The mixing of these Tamils with the Thais long ago also resulted in <br />influence to the Thai Vocabulary. For Example:</p>
<p>Tamil Thai English <br />Thangam Thongam Gold <br />Kappal Kamban Ship <br />Malai Male Garland <br />Krambu Klambu Kurry <br />Kenty Kently Small vessel <br />Appa Pa Father  <br />Thatha Tha Grandfather <br />Amma Me Mother <br />Guru Gru Teacher <br />Asan Asan Teacher <br />Puttan Puttan Great Grandfather <br />Puthran Puthru Son  </p>
<p>And so many others. In addition the days and months names are <br />similar with the Tamil ones.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Hence the interactions of the Cholas in the Chao-Phraya Delta which <br />was named by the Cholas as Meenam treated equally with the Kaveri <br />river Delta, preferred to settled and considerably influenced the <br />Thais in all ways of life which excelled even the original Chola <br />culture by its sober nature.</p>

<p>    Interactions of the Chola empire in the Chao Phraya Delta </p>
<p>    G.Deivanayagam [also in PDF]<br />    Tamil University, Thanjavur</p>
<p>    Abstract: The Chola Empire of South India (9th to 12th C.AD ) <br />was <br />  in <br />    a position to establish strong contracts with the delta of <br />    Chao_Phraya Chao Phraya River of Thailand in the medieval <br />period. <br />    They have very well established this contract by Diplomatic <br />trade <br />    and religious means. The impact of this South Indian Empire <br />caused <br />  a <br />    considerable effect in the Customs, Manners, Religious <br />practices, <br />    Place names art forms and Architecture etc of the Thais for <br />  example <br />    the former name of Bangkok, Krungthep is nothing but <br />Kuranguthope <br />  of <br />    Tamil means the "Monkey's forest". In the close proximity, at <br />  Bujung <br />    valley of Malaysia, there was establishment of Cholas in this <br />    period, which is very well connected with this delta and <br />    gives "Siva, Vishnu, Thiruppavai, Mulaipali, etc., and enhances <br />  the <br />    intrinsic culture and art forms of Thailand. This paper will <br />deal <br />    with all these facets and gives substantial conclusions on the <br />    history of Thai arts and Religion.</p>
<p>    -----------------------------------------------------------------<br />--<br />  --<br />    -----------</p>
<p>    1 Introduction</p>
<p>    The Chola country of South India and the Siam (Thailand) of <br />    Indochina are located in the same latitude. The Chola country, <br />the <br />    east cost part in the Peninsular India is facing the Chao-Phraya <br />    Delta of Siam through Bay of Bengal. Almost similar landscape, <br />    climate, flora and fauna are seen on either sides in the Chao-<br />  Phraya <br />    Delta and of the Kavery Delta. Although differed in <br />physiological <br />    forms as Dravidian and Mongoloid, the behavioural pattern of <br />both <br />    the Tamils and Thais are identical. Their food stuffs, <br />  preparations, <br />    manners and customs, ceremonies and rituals, culture and <br />  psychology <br />    are analogous.</p>
<p>    A cultural unity is visible amidst the linguistic and <br />  physiological <br />    diversity between these two different distant parts of Asia and <br />    ethnic groups. How have these similarities or cultural unities <br />    happened between South India and Siam? A thorough probing <br />reveals <br />    enormous facts and explores hundreds of evidences in the Chao <br />  Phraya <br />    Delta.</p>
<p>    2 Early contacts</p>
<p>    Accordingly one may assume the trade contact of these two <br />  countries <br />    even in the Pre- Christian era along with the Ptolemy and <br />Periplus <br />    references, sea trade was flourishing in that early period in <br />the <br />    ancient port cities of the Chola’s Kaveripumpattinam, <br />  Nagappattinam <br />    &amp; Puducherry, with both east &amp; west. The commercial trade <br />contacts <br />    between South India and Siam were very well established from <br />  Pallava <br />    period of 6th A.D.</p>
<p>    Before 12th C.A.D. the present day Thailand was longitudinally <br />    divided in two halves and ruled by Combodian khmers and Mons of <br />    Burma. The Combodia, Burma, Malay Peninsula like south east <br />Asian <br />    countries were all well influenced by the South Indian culture <br />and <br />    trade in these periods. The close proximity of South Indian port <br />    cities like Mahabalipuram, Puducheri, Kaverippumpattinam, <br />    Nagappattinam etc. with Malaya, Kedah, Combodia promoted not <br />only <br />    the trade but also the culture of these Mon-Khmers, who are with <br />  no <br />    doubt the forefathers of the Thais. Hence the Thais of <br />Swarnabhumi <br />    were not reluctant in accepting the culture of their <br />forefathers, <br />    Mon-Khmers, who were very much Indian Brahmanical. Since these <br />  Mons <br />    and Khmers were able to cover the lower and middle parts of the <br />    Siam, this cultural diffusion reached only in these two parts <br />  which <br />    received many changes in the course of time, rather than the <br />    northern part which received this influence after a long time.</p>
<p>    3 Cultural similarities</p>
<p>    Inscriptions</p>
<p>    The earliest inscriptions numbering more than 200, of all south <br />  east <br />    Asian countries are all of Sanskrit language written in Grantha <br />    script, a common script between Sanskrit and Tamil , which <br />    originated in the Pallava period in the Chola country by the <br />    Brahmins. No other scripts has been discovered so far. This <br />    professes the impact of the Chola country on South east Asian <br />    countries in the early period (Chabra 1965; 72-76)</p>
<p>    Three Grantha inscriptions of 5th C.A.D. and two of 6th C.A.D. <br />at <br />    Kuanlukput , one 7th C.A.D. inscriptions and one of 8th C.A.D. <br />at <br />    Nakhon si Thammarad were discovered so far which are all in the <br />    southern part of Siam only that is in the Chao-Phraya Delta.</p>
<p>    A 5th C.A.D. Sanskrit inscription discovered from «Sithep» of <br />  Siam <br />    is displayed at Bangkok Museum. Such inscriptions seen at wat <br />    Maheyang and Sonkai valley, explains the impact of South Indian <br />    Sanscrit in Siam. Since the early scripts used in these <br />countries <br />    are all « Grantha». Almost all the scripts of these countriesof <br />    Indo-China are formulated in an analogous form with Grantha <br />    and «Thai» is the typical example for that. The flowing and <br />  cursive <br />    nature of these scripts proves it.</p>
<p>    TAKUA-PA TAMIL INSCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>    Above all an important Tamil inscription was found at the Wat <br />    Naramiang temple of Takua-pa which confirms the permanent <br />    settlements of the Tamils in Chao-Phraya Delta. This inscription <br />    reads as follows:</p>
<p>    «…(5) Varman Ku (na) … Manthan Naankuurula Yaa(n) Thotta <br />  Kulam per <br />    Siri Avani Naranam Manikkramatharkkum Sena Muhatarkum Patharkum <br />    Adaikalam».</p>
<p>    Tamil merchant named…Manthan dug one tank (for the Domestic <br />  purpose <br />    of) by the name of Shri.Avani Naranam (which was) handed over <br />for <br />    custody (for it’s protection) to the people of the concerned <br />    settlement Manik Kramam, Senamuham and Devotees. (Kongknew <br />    Veeraprajeck :1986 : 7-20).</p>
<p>    TAMIL SETTLEMENTS IN SIAM</p>
<p>    The inference from this inscription gives a clear and vivid <br />  account <br />    of the influence of the Chola country in Chao-Phraya Delta. They <br />    were not only well settled with all domestic comforts but also <br />  with <br />    religious provisions in this distant place.</p>
<p>    This researcher consider that digging that tank happened in a <br />  later <br />    period in that Tamil merchant settlement called Avani Narana <br />    Manikkramam which was a vaishnavite above where there was a <br />temple <br />    for Vishnu was already existing. Since the inhabitants of this <br />    settlement are all very rich traders living with invaluable <br />  riches, <br />    the entire settlement was well protected by the armed forces <br />  called <br />    Senamugam. These residents were all staunch Vaishnavites and <br />    devotees. Therefore the new comer … Manthan from Naankur in the <br />    Chola country, which was also a Chola’s port town near to <br />  «Puhar», <br />    who earned well after having connection with this «Avani <br />  Naranam», <br />    decided to dig this temple tank in gratitude.</p>
<p>    PEY WORSHIP</p>
<p>    The worship of Karaikal Ammaiyar or Peyar is a typical identical <br />  and <br />    unique religious practice of the trader community of Chola <br />  country. <br />    This Peyar was a pious lady of this trader community connected <br />  with <br />    Siva worship celebrated for her chastity depicted in the form of <br />a <br />    skeleton along with the image of dancing Siva. Such a Siva panel <br />    along with Karaikal Ammaiyar is found at Pimay, and in the <br />    triangular pediment of the eastern façade of the Phnam Rung Siva <br />    temple of North east Siam. The image of teaching Siva-<br />  Dakshinamurthy <br />    is also found in this temple.</p>
<p>    SAIVISM</p>
<p>    The great number of Sivalinga discovered so far in Siam tells <br />the <br />    influence of Siavism in Siam in 5th C. and after. The findings <br />    of «Muha lingas» prooves that there was a great impact of <br />  Saivism in <br />    Siam in Pallava period. An image of Siva with five heads and Ten <br />    hands is displayed at the Museum of Ayutthaya. Dancing Siva with <br />    ornaments is seen at Kut Suen Teng temple. Three Brahmin temples <br />    were discovered at Negara Se Thamma Raja. They are of Brick <br />    structures dating to 11th C. AD(Stanley O’connor : 19 : 1-22). <br />  In <br />    the eastern faç ade of the Pimay Buddhist temple an image of <br />  Rishaba <br />    Vahana Siva in seen. Images of Siva, Uma and Yama were <br />discovered <br />  at <br />    Woa Daeng cave and Prasat Hin …quot; Nong Hong of North East <br />Siam. <br />  Tjhey <br />    belong to 11th C.A.D. and of Chola in style. It is being <br />confirmed <br />    by the Siva of Viengsra.</p>
<p>    The practice of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai in Siam is an <br />  another <br />    evidence of the interaction of the Cholas. The Thais are in <br />  general <br />    familiar with Pranava and Panchatchara that is Om and Namasivaya.</p>
<p>    IMPACT OF AGAMAS</p>
<p>    Cholas were following the Agama tradition in their temple <br />rituals <br />    and chanting the Thevaram, Thiruvasagam, Thiruvempavai and <br />    Thiruppavai and Nalayera Thivya Prabantham in temples. Similar <br />    practices are found in Siam, should have been by the <br />interactions <br />  of <br />    the Cholas.</p>
<p>    VAISHNAVISM</p>
<p>    In 1902 W.Walter Bourke has found out the sculptures of Brahma, <br />    Vishmu and Siva on the banks of river Takua Pah at Koupra Narai <br />  and <br />    declared about the influence of south india over Siam. Vishnu <br />  images <br />    were found out from Nakhon Sithammarat, Pimay, Bangkok, Cayya, <br />  Takua <br />    Pah, OCEO, Phetburi etc. According to Pier Dewpond the Takua Pah <br />    Vishnu is belongs to Chola style. Almost all the Icnographic <br />  details <br />    of the available Vishnu images at Siam implies the influence of <br />  the <br />    Pallava style. This researcher has studied some of the Buddhist <br />    images of Sukkhothai and Ayutthaya collection and came to the <br />    conclusion that: a) Some of them were moulded by the Chola <br />  sculptors <br />    at Siam in Tanjorian style.</p>
<p>    b) Some of them were costed at Thanjavur, Nagappattinam and <br />  brought <br />    to Siam either to their own settlements or to the Thai public or <br />    royalty. Prince Chand Chirayu Rajani, in his book entitled «Thai <br />    imageries of Swarnabhumi Art» mentioned about my view points. <br />The <br />    area of ‘Sitep’ should have been a strong hold of Vaishnavism <br />  and of <br />    Indian settlement in Pallava and Chola period. Stanely O’Connor <br />    considers that the ancient architectural and archaeological <br />  findings <br />    of Thailand dating from 5th to 9th C.A.D. are all Brahmanical <br />and <br />  of <br />    South India. They are of either late Pallava or early Chola in <br />    style. The reclining image of Vishnu, Govarthana lila are also <br />    identified at a dilabitated temple in the eastern part of <br />  Thailand. <br />    One Bairava sculpture of Viang Sira confirms the Indian or <br />Brahmin <br />    towns formed in Siam in those period.</p>
<p>    TAMIL BUDDHISM …quot; THAI BUDDHISM</p>
<p>    This iconographical, religious and cultural influence of the <br />  Cholas <br />    over Thailand was reflected in Thai Buddhism also. Experts used <br />to <br />    classify the Thai Buddhist Bronzes mainly into two categories. <br />  They <br />    are</p>
<p>    1) Pallavanised and 2) Cholified ones.</p>
<p>    In cholification the «Nagappattinam bronze casting» technique <br />    (Tanjorian) was highly appreciated and adopted by the Thais.</p>
<p>    RELIGION &amp; PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>    The South Indian philosophy of Hinduism and Buddhism which were <br />    prevailing in the Chola period were also being adopted by the <br />    Siamese which are clearly referred by Pre Rup Stele Inscription <br />  and <br />    Prasat Kok Po inscriptions. The South Indian Buddhist Monks like <br />    Vinita Ruci and Vajrabodhi spreaded Buddhism of Chola country in <br />    Siam, Vietnam and Laos.</p>
<p>    RAMAYANA</p>
<p>    Another strong proof of Cholas interaction in Siam is Ramayana. <br />  The <br />    Ramakian practised by the Thais are analogous to Cholas Kamba <br />    Ramayanam only and the Mayil Ravanan story is also of South <br />India <br />    (Mayirab Story).</p>
<p>    There are 21 similarities found between Kamba Ramayanan and <br />    Ramakian. For example the love at first sight between Phra Ram <br />and <br />    Nangsidha.</p>
<p>    The Ramayana sculptures of Lobpuri temple wall and of Pimay <br />Buddha <br />    temple depicting the epic with flying Hanuman with Sanjeevi <br />hill, <br />    the fainted Lakhsmana, Building the Sethu bridge by the Monkeys, <br />    nose cut of Surpanaka, defeat of Vali etc. The word «Ramakien» <br />  is <br />    only a corrupt form of «Rama Kirthi».</p>
<p>    THIRUPPAVAI - THIRUVEMPAVAI</p>
<p>    Chanting of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai by the Thai Brahmins <br />  were <br />    also introduced into Thailand by the Cholas only. Some of the <br />    Thevaram like «Mattitta Punnayang Kanal» etc. and Thivya <br />  Prapandham <br />    like. ‘Thiru Valuthi Natennum’, «Uyarvara Uyarnalam <br />  Udaiyavan» etc <br />    are also being mixed in their chanting. They are quite familiar <br />  with <br />    Thiruchitrambalam, Narayaname and Namasivaya. This author was <br />able <br />    to see same Tamil leaf also in the Grantha Palm leaf manuscripts <br />    kept by the Thai Brahmans, which reveals that Tamil was familiar <br />    with the Thai Brahmans in Chola period. They were well versed in <br />    Grantha also. But nowadays without knowing the script and the <br />    meaning, the phonemes were written in Thai script in a corrupt <br />  form <br />    and they are chanted.</p>
<p>    Hindu customs and rituals were followed by Thai royalty even in <br />    their coronation ceremony.</p>
<p>    GARUDA</p>
<p>    The image of Garudantika the flying Kite man carrying Vishnu on <br />  his <br />    shoulder is familiar with Thailand. (Bangkok Emerald Buddha <br />  temple, <br />    Pimay Buddha temple, etc.) G.Deivanayagam The Chola Empire and <br />the <br />    Chao Phraya Delta</p>
<p>    The Chao Phraya Delta: Historical Development, Dynamics and <br />    Challenges of Thailand' Rice Bowl 6</p>
<p>    VISHNU AND RAJA</p>
<p>    The reclaiming Vishnu is identical with Chola country is found <br />in <br />    Siam. Vishnu with two consorts is a Chola’s production which is <br />    being seen in Siam. They are Lakshmi and Pudevi. Pudevi is <br />    considered or treated as Maheswari by the Siamese.</p>
<p>    The Hari-hara (Half Vishnu …quot; Half Siva) is flourished among <br />  South <br />    Indian smartha Brahmins. The very same practice was in existence <br />  at <br />    Siam even in 7th C.A.D. when Esana Varman was ruling Siam. There <br />  is <br />    a great saying among the Cholas as follows. «Seeing the king is <br />    seeing the Vishnu» The same concept is seen at Siam. King <br />    Ramathipaty who established the Ayutthaya kingdom calling <br />himself <br />  as <br />    Narayana …quot; Nara, and ordered for a full fledged annual <br />ceremony <br />  in <br />    the Nagara Sri Thammarat.</p>
<p>    THE BRAHMAN TEMPLES</p>
<p>    In the Thai Brahman temple complex of Bangkok a Ganesh temple, <br />  Siva <br />    temple and a Vishnu temple are Seen. This Vishnu is being named <br />as <br />    Sugothaya Perumal, typical Tamil name, Sugothayam is the former <br />  name <br />    of the Thailand. This name consists of two syllables Suga + <br />  Uthayam <br />    that is the «Pleasant dawn». Like Korea the land of morning <br />  calm, <br />    Thailand was treated by the Cholas as a land of «Pleasant dawn».</p>
<p>    SWINGS</p>
<p>    The ‘Great Swings’ seen in Thai Brahmin temples and theSwing <br />    festivals (Login wor) are all of South Indian tradition only.</p>
<p>    PAVAAI</p>
<p>    The «Paavai Nonbu» (December and January) was familiar with the <br />    Thais until 1940. Nowadays it has been reduced to a temple <br />ritual.</p>
<p>    RAIN FESTIVAL</p>
<p>    The rain festival and the Mantra Chanting that time are all of <br />  Tamil <br />    in tradition. It affirms the loyalty of the people to the king <br />    as «We serve you not only today; but for forth coming 7 births <br />  also.</p>
<p>    DEEPAWALI &amp; KARTHIKAI</p>
<p>    Deepavali and Karthikai festivals were also introduced by the <br />  Cholas <br />    in Siam. The Karthikai festival is being celebrated as «Malai» <br />    (Thiruvannamalai fire festival) by the Thais. The float <br />festivals <br />  of <br />    Thais are also similar with the Tamil Cholas.</p>
<p>    THE THAI CHOLAS</p>
<p>    «The kings of Ayutthaya were proud to call themselves as Cholas» <br />    (Paul Pelliot …quot; ‘Encore A Propos Des Voyages De Tcheng <br />Howo’ <br />    Toungpao 1936). The story of the Manu neethi Chola was familiar <br />    among Sugothays and king Ramakongheng had installed a bell for <br />the <br />    public call for justice. (David K.Wyatt 1984 : 54)</p>
<p>    TAMILS AND TAMIL IN THAILAND</p>
<p>    The Tamil people migrated to Siam in the Chola period, slowly <br />lost <br />    their language and culture and mingled with the Thais. But one <br />can <br />    see the Physiological features of this Chola Thais from the <br />    Mongoloid Thai natives.</p>
<p>    The mixing of these Tamils with the Thais long ago also resulted <br />  in <br />    influence to the Thai Vocabulary. For Example:</p>
<p>    Tamil Thai English <br />    Thangam Thongam Gold <br />    Kappal Kamban Ship <br />    Malai Male Garland <br />    Krambu Klambu Kurry <br />    Kenty Kently Small vessel <br />    Appa Pa Father  <br />    Thatha Tha Grandfather <br />    Amma Me Mother <br />    Guru Gru Teacher <br />    Asan Asan Teacher <br />    Puttan Puttan Great Grandfather <br />    Puthran Puthru Son  </p>
<p>    And so many others. In addition the days and months names are <br />    similar with the Tamil ones.</p>
<p>    CONCLUSION</p>
<p>    Hence the interactions of the Cholas in the Chao-Phraya Delta <br />  which <br />    was named by the Cholas as Meenam treated equally with the <br />Kaveri <br />    river Delta, preferred to settled and considerably influenced <br />the <br />    Thais in all ways of life which excelled even the original Chola <br />    culture by its sober nature.</p>

<p>  Interactions of the Chola empire in the Chao Phraya Delta </p>
<p>  G.Deivanayagam [also in PDF]<br />  Tamil University, Thanjavur</p>
<p>  Abstract: The Chola Empire of South India (9th to 12th C.AD ) was <br />in <br />  a position to establish strong contracts with the delta of <br />  Chao_Phraya Chao Phraya River of Thailand in the medieval period. <br />  They have very well established this contract by Diplomatic trade <br />  and religious means. The impact of this South Indian Empire caused <br />a <br />  considerable effect in the Customs, Manners, Religious practices, <br />  Place names art forms and Architecture etc of the Thais for <br />example <br />  the former name of Bangkok, Krungthep is nothing but Kuranguthope <br />of <br />  Tamil means the "Monkey's forest". In the close proximity, at <br />Bujung <br />  valley of Malaysia, there was establishment of Cholas in this <br />  period, which is very well connected with this delta and <br />  gives "Siva, Vishnu, Thiruppavai, Mulaipali, etc., and enhances <br />the <br />  intrinsic culture and art forms of Thailand. This paper will deal <br />  with all these facets and gives substantial conclusions on the <br />  history of Thai arts and Religion.</p>
<p>  -------------------------------------------------------------------<br />--<br />  -----------</p>
<p>  1 Introduction</p>
<p>  The Chola country of South India and the Siam (Thailand) of <br />  Indochina are located in the same latitude. The Chola country, the <br />  east cost part in the Peninsular India is facing the Chao-Phraya <br />  Delta of Siam through Bay of Bengal. Almost similar landscape, <br />  climate, flora and fauna are seen on either sides in the Chao-<br />Phraya <br />  Delta and of the Kavery Delta. Although differed in physiological <br />  forms as Dravidian and Mongoloid, the behavioural pattern of both <br />  the Tamils and Thais are identical. Their food stuffs, <br />preparations, <br />  manners and customs, ceremonies and rituals, culture and <br />psychology <br />  are analogous.</p>
<p>  A cultural unity is visible amidst the linguistic and <br />physiological <br />  diversity between these two different distant parts of Asia and <br />  ethnic groups. How have these similarities or cultural unities <br />  happened between South India and Siam? A thorough probing reveals <br />  enormous facts and explores hundreds of evidences in the Chao <br />Phraya <br />  Delta.</p>
<p>  2 Early contacts</p>
<p>  Accordingly one may assume the trade contact of these two <br />countries <br />  even in the Pre- Christian era along with the Ptolemy and Periplus <br />  references, sea trade was flourishing in that early period in the <br />  ancient port cities of the Chola’s Kaveripumpattinam, <br />Nagappattinam <br />  &amp; Puducherry, with both east &amp; west. The commercial trade contacts <br />  between South India and Siam were very well established from <br />Pallava <br />  period of 6th A.D.</p>
<p>  Before 12th C.A.D. the present day Thailand was longitudinally <br />  divided in two halves and ruled by Combodian khmers and Mons of <br />  Burma. The Combodia, Burma, Malay Peninsula like south east Asian <br />  countries were all well influenced by the South Indian culture and <br />  trade in these periods. The close proximity of South Indian port <br />  cities like Mahabalipuram, Puducheri, Kaverippumpattinam, <br />  Nagappattinam etc. with Malaya, Kedah, Combodia promoted not only <br />  the trade but also the culture of these Mon-Khmers, who are with <br />no <br />  doubt the forefathers of the Thais. Hence the Thais of Swarnabhumi <br />  were not reluctant in accepting the culture of their forefathers, <br />  Mon-Khmers, who were very much Indian Brahmanical. Since these <br />Mons <br />  and Khmers were able to cover the lower and middle parts of the <br />  Siam, this cultural diffusion reached only in these two parts <br />which <br />  received many changes in the course of time, rather than the <br />  northern part which received this influence after a long time.</p>
<p>  3 Cultural similarities</p>
<p>  Inscriptions</p>
<p>  The earliest inscriptions numbering more than 200, of all south <br />east <br />  Asian countries are all of Sanskrit language written in Grantha <br />  script, a common script between Sanskrit and Tamil , which <br />  originated in the Pallava period in the Chola country by the <br />  Brahmins. No other scripts has been discovered so far. This <br />  professes the impact of the Chola country on South east Asian <br />  countries in the early period (Chabra 1965; 72-76)</p>
<p>  Three Grantha inscriptions of 5th C.A.D. and two of 6th C.A.D. at <br />  Kuanlukput , one 7th C.A.D. inscriptions and one of 8th C.A.D. at <br />  Nakhon si Thammarad were discovered so far which are all in the <br />  southern part of Siam only that is in the Chao-Phraya Delta.</p>
<p>  A 5th C.A.D. Sanskrit inscription discovered from «Sithep» of <br />Siam <br />  is displayed at Bangkok Museum. Such inscriptions seen at wat <br />  Maheyang and Sonkai valley, explains the impact of South Indian <br />  Sanscrit in Siam. Since the early scripts used in these countries <br />  are all « Grantha». Almost all the scripts of these countries of <br />  Indo-China are formulated in an analogous form with Grantha <br />  and «Thai» is the typical example for that. The flowing and <br />cursive <br />  nature of these scripts proves it.</p>
<p>  TAKUA-PA TAMIL INSCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>  Above all an important Tamil inscription was found at the Wat <br />  Naramiang temple of Takua-pa which confirms the permanent <br />  settlements of the Tamils in Chao-Phraya Delta. This inscription <br />  reads as follows:</p>
<p>  «…(5) Varman Ku (na) … Manthan Naankuurula Yaa(n) Thotta <br />Kulam per <br />  Siri Avani Naranam Manikkramatharkkum Sena Muhatarkum Patharkum <br />  Adaikalam».</p>
<p>  Tamil merchant named…Manthan dug one tank (for the Domestic <br />purpose <br />  of) by the name of Shri.Avani Naranam (which was) handed over for <br />  custody (for it’s protection) to the people of the concerned <br />  settlement Manik Kramam, Senamuham and Devotees. (Kongknew <br />  Veeraprajeck :1986 : 7-20).</p>
<p>  TAMIL SETTLEMENTS IN SIAM</p>
<p>  The inference from this inscription gives a clear and vivid <br />account <br />  of the influence of the Chola country in Chao-Phraya Delta. They <br />  were not only well settled with all domestic comforts but also <br />with <br />  religious provisions in this distant place.</p>
<p>  This researcher consider that digging that tank happened in a <br />later <br />  period in that Tamil merchant settlement called Avani Narana <br />  Manikkramam which was a vaishnavite above where there was a temple <br />  for Vishnu was already existing. Since the inhabitants of this <br />  settlement are all very rich traders living with invaluable <br />riches, <br />  the entire settlement was well protected by the armed forces <br />called <br />  Senamugam. These residents were all staunch Vaishnavites and <br />  devotees. Therefore the new comer … Manthan from Naankur in the <br />  Chola country, which was also a Chola’s port town near to <br />«Puhar», <br />  who earned well after having connection with this «Avani <br />Naranam», <br />  decided to dig this temple tank in gratitude.</p>
<p>  PEY WORSHIP</p>
<p>  The worship of Karaikal Ammaiyar or Peyar is a typical identical <br />and <br />  unique religious practice of the trader community of Chola <br />country. <br />  This Peyar was a pious lady of this trader community connected <br />with <br />  Siva worship celebrated for her chastity depicted in the form of a <br />  skeleton along with the image of dancing Siva. Such a Siva panel <br />  along with Karaikal Ammaiyar is found at Pimay, and in the <br />  triangular pediment of the eastern façade of the Phnam Rung Siva <br />  temple of North east Siam. The image of teaching Siva-<br />Dakshinamurthy <br />  is also found in this temple.</p>
<p>  SAIVISM</p>
<p>  The great number of Sivalinga discovered so far in Siam tells the <br />  influence of Siavism in Siam in 5th C. and after. The findings <br />  of «Muha lingas» prooves that there was a great impact of <br />Saivism in <br />  Siam in Pallava period. An image of Siva with five heads and Ten <br />  hands is displayed at the Museum of Ayutthaya. Dancing Siva with <br />  ornaments is seen at Kut Suen Teng temple. Three Brahmin temples <br />  were discovered at Negara Se Thamma Raja. They are of Brick <br />  structures dating to 11th C. AD(Stanley O’connor : 19 : 1-22). <br />In <br />  the eastern faç ade of the Pimay Buddhist temple an image of <br />Rishaba <br />  Vahana Siva in seen. Images of Siva, Uma and Yama were discovered <br />at <br />  Woa Daeng cave and Prasat Hin ??" Nong Hong of North East Siam. <br />Tjhey <br />  belong to 11th C.A.D. and of Chola in style. It is being confirmed <br />  by the Siva of Viengsra.</p>
<p>  The practice of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai in Siam is an <br />another <br />  evidence of the interaction of the Cholas. The Thais are in <br />general <br />  familiar with Pranava and Panchatchara that is Om and Namasivaya.</p>
<p>  IMPACT OF AGAMAS</p>
<p>  Cholas were following the Agama tradition in their temple rituals <br />  and chanting the Thevaram, Thiruvasagam, Thiruvempavai and <br />  Thiruppavai and Nalayera Thivya Prabantham in temples. Similar <br />  practices are found in Siam, should have been by the interactions <br />of <br />  the Cholas.</p>
<p>  VAISHNAVISM</p>
<p>  In 1902 W.Walter Bourke has found out the sculptures of Brahma, <br />  Vishmu and Siva on the banks of river Takua Pah at Koupra Narai <br />and <br />  declared about the influence of south india over Siam. Vishnu <br />images <br />  were found out from Nakhon Sithammarat, Pimay, Bangkok, Cayya, <br />Takua <br />  Pah, OCEO, Phetburi etc. According to Pier Dewpond the Takua Pah <br />  Vishnu is belongs to Chola style. Almost all the Icnographic <br />details <br />  of the available Vishnu images at Siam implies the influence of <br />the <br />  Pallava style. This researcher has studied some of the Buddhist <br />  images of Sukkhothai and Ayutthaya collection and came to the <br />  conclusion that: a) Some of them were moulded by the Chola <br />sculptors <br />  at Siam in Tanjorian style.</p>
<p>  b) Some of them were costed at Thanjavur, Nagappattinam and <br />brought <br />  to Siam either to their own settlements or to the Thai public or <br />  royalty. Prince Chand Chirayu Rajani, in his book entitled «Thai <br />  imageries of Swarnabhumi Art» mentioned about my view points. The <br />  area of ‘Sitep’ should have been a strong hold of Vaishnavism <br />and of <br />  Indian settlement in Pallava and Chola period. Stanely O’Connor <br />  considers that the ancient architectural and archaeological <br />findings <br />  of Thailand dating from 5th to 9th C.A.D. are all Brahmanical and <br />of <br />  South India. They are of either late Pallava or early Chola in <br />  style. The reclining image of Vishnu, Govarthana lila are also <br />  identified at a dilabitated temple in the eastern part of <br />Thailand. <br />  One Bairava sculpture of Viang Sira confirms the Indian or Brahmin <br />  towns formed in Siam in those period.</p>
<p>  TAMIL BUDDHISM ??" THAI BUDDHISM</p>
<p>  This iconographical, religious and cultural influence of the <br />Cholas <br />  over Thailand was reflected in Thai Buddhism also. Experts used to <br />  classify the Thai Buddhist Bronzes mainly into two categories. <br />They <br />  are</p>
<p>  1) Pallavanised and 2) Cholified ones.</p>
<p>  In cholification the «Nagappattinam bronze casting» technique <br />  (Tanjorian) was highly appreciated and adopted by the Thais.</p>
<p>  RELIGION &amp; PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>  The South Indian philosophy of Hinduism and Buddhism which were <br />  prevailing in the Chola period were also being adopted by the <br />  Siamese which are clearly referred by Pre Rup Stele Inscription <br />and <br />  Prasat Kok Po inscriptions. The South Indian Buddhist Monks like <br />  Vinita Ruci and Vajrabodhi spreaded Buddhism of Chola country in <br />  Siam, Vietnam and Laos.</p>
<p>  RAMAYANA</p>
<p>  Another strong proof of Cholas interaction in Siam is Ramayana. <br />The <br />  Ramakian practised by the Thais are analogous to Cholas Kamba <br />  Ramayanam only and the Mayil Ravanan story is also of South India <br />  (Mayirab Story).</p>
<p>  There are 21 similarities found between Kamba Ramayanan and <br />  Ramakian. For example the love at first sight between Phra Ram and <br />  Nangsidha.</p>
<p>  The Ramayana sculptures of Lobpuri temple wall and of Pimay Buddha <br />  temple depicting the epic with flying Hanuman with Sanjeevi hill, <br />  the fainted Lakhsmana, Building the Sethu bridge by the Monkeys, <br />  nose cut of Surpanaka, defeat of Vali etc. The word «Ramakien» <br />is <br />  only a corrupt form of «Rama Kirthi».</p>
<p>  THIRUPPAVAI - THIRUVEMPAVAI</p>
<p>  Chanting of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai by the Thai Brahmins <br />were <br />  also introduced into Thailand by the Cholas only. Some of the <br />  Thevaram like «Mattitta Punnayang Kanal» etc. and Thivya <br />Prapandham <br />  like. ‘Thiru Valuthi Natennum’, «Uyarvara Uyarnalam <br />Udaiyavan» etc <br />  are also being mixed in their chanting. They are quite familiar <br />with <br />  Thiruchitrambalam, Narayaname and Namasivaya. This author was able <br />  to see same Tamil leaf also in the Grantha Palm leaf manuscripts <br />  kept by the Thai Brahmans, which reveals that Tamil was familiar <br />  with the Thai Brahmans in Chola period. They were well versed in <br />  Grantha also. But nowadays without knowing the script and the <br />  meaning, the phonemes were written in Thai script in a corrupt <br />form <br />  and they are chanted.</p>
<p>  Hindu customs and rituals were followed by Thai royalty even in <br />  their coronation ceremony.</p>
<p>  GARUDA</p>
<p>  The image of Garudantika the flying Kite man carrying Vishnu on <br />his <br />  shoulder is familiar with Thailand. (Bangkok Emerald Buddha <br />temple, <br />  Pimay Buddha temple, etc.) G.Deivanayagam The Chola Empire and the <br />  Chao Phraya Delta</p>
<p>  The Chao Phraya Delta: Historical Development, Dynamics and <br />  Challenges of Thailand' Rice Bowl 6</p>
<p>  VISHNU AND RAJA</p>
<p>  The reclaiming Vishnu is identical with Chola country is found in <br />  Siam. Vishnu with two consorts is a Chola’s production which is <br />  being seen in Siam. They are Lakshmi and Pudevi. Pudevi is <br />  considered or treated as Maheswari by the Siamese.</p>
<p>  The Hari-hara (Half Vishnu ??" Half Siva) is flourished among <br />South <br />  Indian smartha Brahmins. The very same practice was in existence <br />at <br />  Siam even in 7th C.A.D. when Esana Varman was ruling Siam. There <br />is <br />  a great saying among the Cholas as follows. «Seeing the king is <br />  seeing the Vishnu» The same concept is seen at Siam. King <br />  Ramathipaty who established the Ayutthaya kingdom calling himself <br />as <br />  Narayana ??" Nara, and ordered for a full fledged annual ceremony <br />in <br />  the Nagara Sri Thammarat.</p>
<p>  THE BRAHMAN TEMPLES</p>
<p>  In the Thai Brahman temple complex of Bangkok a Ganesh temple, <br />Siva <br />  temple and a Vishnu temple are Seen. This Vishnu is being named as <br />  Sugothaya Perumal, typical Tamil name, Sugothayam is the former <br />name <br />  of the Thailand. This name consists of two syllables Suga + <br />Uthayam <br />  that is the «Pleasant dawn». Like Korea the land of morning <br />calm, <br />  Thailand was treated by the Cholas as a land of «Pleasant dawn».</p>
<p>  SWINGS</p>
<p>  The ‘Great Swings’ seen in Thai Brahmin temples and the Swing <br />  festivals (Login wor) are all of South Indian tradition only.</p>
<p>  PAVAAI</p>
<p>  The «Paavai Nonbu» (December and January) was familiar with the <br />  Thais until 1940. Nowadays it has been reduced to a temple ritual.</p>
<p>  RAIN FESTIVAL</p>
<p>  The rain festival and the Mantra Chanting that time are all of <br />Tamil <br />  in tradition. It affirms the loyalty of the people to the king <br />  as «We serve you not only today; but for forth coming 7 births <br />also.</p>
<p>  DEEPAWALI &amp; KARTHIKAI</p>
<p>  Deepavali and Karthikai festivals were also introduced by the <br />Cholas <br />  in Siam. The Karthikai festival is being celebrated as «Malai» <br />  (Thiruvannamalai fire festival) by the Thais. The float festivals <br />of <br />  Thais are also similar with the Tamil Cholas.</p>
<p>  THE THAI CHOLAS</p>
<p>  «The kings of Ayutthaya were proud to call themselves as Cholas» <br />  (Paul Pelliot ??" ‘Encore A Propos Des Voyages De Tcheng Howo’ <br />  Toungpao 1936). The story of the Manu neethi Chola was familiar <br />  among Sugothays and king Ramakongheng had installed a bell for the <br />  public call for justice. (David K.Wyatt 1984 : 54)</p>
<p>  TAMILS AND TAMIL IN THAILAND</p>
<p>  The Tamil people migrated to Siam in the Chola period, slowly lost <br />  their language and culture and mingled with the Thais. But one can <br />  see the Physiological features of this Chola Thais from the <br />  Mongoloid Thai natives.</p>
<p>  The mixing of these Tamils with the Thais long ago also resulted <br />in <br />  influence to the Thai Vocabulary. For Example:</p>
<p>  Tamil Thai English <br />  Thangam Thongam Gold <br />  Kappal Kamban Ship <br />  Malai Male Garland <br />  Krambu Klambu Kurry <br />  Kenty Kently Small vessel <br />  Appa Pa Father  <br />  Thatha Tha Grandfather <br />  Amma Me Mother <br />  Guru Gru Teacher <br />  Asan Asan Teacher <br />  Puttan Puttan Great Grandfather <br />  Puthran Puthru Son  </p>
<p>  And so many others. In addition the days and months names are <br />  similar with the Tamil ones.</p>
<p>  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>  Hence the interactions of the Cholas in the Chao-Phraya Delta <br />which <br />  was named by the Cholas as Meenam treated equally with the Kaveri <br />  river Delta, preferred to settled and considerably influenced the <br />  Thais in all ways of life which excelled even the original Chola <br />  culture by its sober nature.</p>

        <p>Wow...<br />Amazing to read this. When I visited the Wat Phrea Kiew temple few<br />years back, I saw the whole Ramayana depicted in beautiful murals. I<br />took some snaps as well.

Yes, the churning of the<br />milk ocean by Asuras and Suras is beautifully depicted and proves that<br />we share the same mythology.<br />Infact, the world heritage site "Ayutthaya" near Bangkok, is the<br />corrupt form of Ayodhya. <br />Regards,<br />Ragothaman</p>

<p>  Interactions of the Chola empire in the Chao Phraya Delta </p>
<p>  G.Deivanayagam [also in PDF]<br />  Tamil University, Thanjavur</p>
<p>  Abstract: The Chola Empire of South India (9th to 12th C.AD ) was in <br />  a position to establish strong contracts with the delta of <br />  Chao_Phraya Chao Phraya River of Thailand in the medieval period. <br />  They have very well established this contract by Diplomatic trade <br />  and religious means. The impact of this South Indian Empire caused a <br />  considerable effect in the Customs, Manners, Religious practices, <br />  Place names art forms and Architecture etc of the Thais for example <br />  the former name of Bangkok, Krungthep is nothing but Kuranguthope of <br />  Tamil means the "Monkey's forest". In the close proximity, at Bujung <br />  valley of Malaysia, there was establishment of Cholas in this <br />  period, which is very well connected with this delta and <br />  gives "Siva, Vishnu, Thiruppavai, Mulaipali, etc., and enhances the <br />  intrinsic culture and art forms of Thailand. This paper will deal <br />  with all these facets and gives substantial conclusions on the <br />  history of Thai arts and Religion.</p>
<p>  ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />  -----------</p>
<p>  1 Introduction</p>
<p>  The Chola country of South India and the Siam (Thailand) of <br />  Indochina are located in the same latitude. The Chola country, the <br />  east cost part in the Peninsular India is facing the Chao-Phraya <br />  Delta of Siam through Bay of Bengal. Almost similar landscape, <br />  climate, flora and fauna are seen on either sides in the Chao-Phraya <br />  Delta and of the Kavery Delta. Although differed in physiological <br />  forms as Dravidian and Mongoloid, the behavioural pattern of both <br />  the Tamils and Thais are identical. Their food stuffs, preparations, <br />  manners and customs, ceremonies and rituals, culture and psychology <br />  are analogous.</p>
<p>  A cultural unity is visible amidst the linguistic and physiological <br />  diversity between these two different distant parts of Asia and <br />  ethnic groups. How have these similarities or cultural unities <br />  happened between South India and Siam? A thorough probing reveals <br />  enormous facts and explores hundreds of evidences in the Chao Phraya <br />  Delta.</p>
<p>  2 Early contacts</p>
<p>  Accordingly one may assume the trade contact of these two countries <br />  even in the Pre- Christian era along with the Ptolemy and Periplus <br />  references, sea trade was flourishing in that early period in the <br />  ancient port cities of the Chola’s Kaveripumpattinam, Nagappattinam <br />  &amp; Puducherry, with both east &amp; west. The commercial trade contacts <br />  between South India and Siam were very well established from Pallava <br />  period of 6th A.D.</p>
<p>  Before 12th C.A.D. the present day Thailand was longitudinally <br />  divided in two halves and ruled by Combodian khmers and Mons of <br />  Burma. The Combodia, Burma, Malay Peninsula like south east Asian <br />  countries were all well influenced by the South Indian culture and <br />  trade in these periods. The close proximity of South Indian port <br />  cities like Mahabalipuram, Puducheri, Kaverippumpattinam, <br />  Nagappattinam etc. with Malaya, Kedah, Combodia promoted not only <br />  the trade but also the culture of these Mon-Khmers, who are with no <br />  doubt the forefathers of the Thais. Hence the Thais of Swarnabhumi <br />  were not reluctant in accepting the culture of their forefathers, <br />  Mon-Khmers, who were very much Indian Brahmanical. Since these Mons <br />  and Khmers were able to cover the lower and middle parts of the <br />  Siam, this cultural diffusion reached only in these two parts which <br />  received many changes in the course of time, rather than the <br />  northern part which received this influence after a long time.</p>
<p>  3 Cultural similarities</p>
<p>  Inscriptions</p>
<p>  The earliest inscriptions numbering more than 200, of all south east <br />  Asian countries are all of Sanskrit language written in Grantha <br />  script, a common script between Sanskrit and Tamil , which <br />  originated in the Pallava period in the Chola country by the <br />  Brahmins. No other scripts has been discovered so far. This <br />  professes the impact of the Chola country on South east Asian <br />  countries in the early period (Chabra 1965; 72-76)</p>
<p>  Three Grantha inscriptions of 5th C.A.D. and two of 6th C.A.D. at <br />  Kuanlukput , one 7th C.A.D. inscriptions and one of 8th C.A.D. at <br />  Nakhon si Thammarad were discovered so far which are all in the <br />  southern part of Siam only that is in the Chao-Phraya Delta.</p>
<p>  A 5th C.A.D. Sanskrit inscription discovered from «Sithep» of Siam <br />  is displayed at Bangkok Museum. Such inscriptions seen at wat <br />  Maheyang and Sonkai valley, explains the impact of South Indian <br />  Sanscrit in Siam. Since the early scripts used in these countries <br />  are all « Grantha». Almost all the scripts of these countries of <br />  Indo-China are formulated in an analogous form with Grantha <br />  and «Thai» is the typical example for that. The flowing and cursive <br />  nature of these scripts proves it.</p>
<p>  TAKUA-PA TAMIL INSCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>  Above all an important Tamil inscription was found at the Wat <br />  Naramiang temple of Takua-pa which confirms the permanent <br />  settlements of the Tamils in Chao-Phraya Delta. This inscription <br />  reads as follows:</p>
<p>  «…(5) Varman Ku (na) … Manthan Naankuurula Yaa(n) Thotta Kulam per <br />  Siri Avani Naranam Manikkramatharkkum Sena Muhatarkum Patharkum <br />  Adaikalam».</p>
<p>  Tamil merchant named…Manthan dug one tank (for the Domestic purpose <br />  of) by the name of Shri.Avani Naranam (which was) handed over for <br />  custody (for it’s protection) to the people of the concerned <br />  settlement Manik Kramam, Senamuham and Devotees. (Kongknew <br />  Veeraprajeck :1986 : 7-20).</p>
<p>  TAMIL SETTLEMENTS IN SIAM</p>
<p>  The inference from this inscription gives a clear and vivid account <br />  of the influence of the Chola country in Chao-Phraya Delta. They <br />  were not only well settled with all domestic comforts but also with <br />  religious provisions in this distant place.</p>
<p>  This researcher consider that digging that tank happened in a later <br />  period in that Tamil merchant settlement called Avani Narana <br />  Manikkramam which was a vaishnavite above where there was a temple <br />  for Vishnu was already existing. Since the inhabitants of this <br />  settlement are all very rich traders living with invaluable riches, <br />  the entire settlement was well protected by the armed forces called <br />  Senamugam. These residents were all staunch Vaishnavites and <br />  devotees. Therefore the new comer … Manthan from Naankur in the <br />  Chola country, which was also a Chola’s port town near to «Puhar», <br />  who earned well after having connection with this «Avani Naranam», <br />  decided to dig this temple tank in gratitude.</p>
<p>  PEY WORSHIP</p>
<p>  The worship of Karaikal Ammaiyar or Peyar is a typical identical and <br />  unique religious practice of the trader community of Chola country. <br />  This Peyar was a pious lady of this trader community connected with <br />  Siva worship celebrated for her chastity depicted in the form of a <br />  skeleton along with the image of dancing Siva. Such a Siva panel <br />  along with Karaikal Ammaiyar is found at Pimay, and in the <br />  triangular pediment of the eastern façade of the Phnam Rung Siva <br />  temple of North east Siam. The image of teaching Siva-Dakshinamurthy <br />  is also found in this temple.</p>
<p>  SAIVISM</p>
<p>  The great number of Sivalinga discovered so far in Siam tells the <br />  influence of Siavism in Siam in 5th C. and after. The findings <br />  of «Muha lingas» prooves that there was a great impact of Saivism in <br />  Siam in Pallava period. An image of Siva with five heads and Ten <br />  hands is displayed at the Museum of Ayutthaya. Dancing Siva with <br />  ornaments is seen at Kut Suen Teng temple. Three Brahmin temples <br />  were discovered at Negara Se Thamma Raja. They are of Brick <br />  structures dating to 11th C. AD(Stanley O’connor : 19 : 1-22). In <br />  the eastern faç ade of the Pimay Buddhist temple an image of Rishaba <br />  Vahana Siva in seen. Images of Siva, Uma and Yama were discovered at <br />  Woa Daeng cave and Prasat Hin ??" Nong Hong of North East Siam. Tjhey <br />  belong to 11th C.A.D. and of Chola in style. It is being confirmed <br />  by the Siva of Viengsra.</p>
<p>  The practice of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai in Siam is an another <br />  evidence of the interaction of the Cholas. The Thais are in general <br />  familiar with Pranava and Panchatchara that is Om and Namasivaya.</p>
<p>  IMPACT OF AGAMAS</p>
<p>  Cholas were following the Agama tradition in their temple rituals <br />  and chanting the Thevaram, Thiruvasagam, Thiruvempavai and <br />  Thiruppavai and Nalayera Thivya Prabantham in temples. Similar <br />  practices are found in Siam, should have been by the interactions of <br />  the Cholas.</p>
<p>  VAISHNAVISM</p>
<p>  In 1902 W.Walter Bourke has found out the sculptures of Brahma, <br />  Vishmu and Siva on the banks of river Takua Pah at Koupra Narai and <br />  declared about the influence of south india over Siam. Vishnu images <br />  were found out from Nakhon Sithammarat, Pimay, Bangkok, Cayya, Takua <br />  Pah, OCEO, Phetburi etc. According to Pier Dewpond the Takua Pah <br />  Vishnu is belongs to Chola style. Almost all the Icnographic details <br />  of the available Vishnu images at Siam implies the influence of the <br />  Pallava style. This researcher has studied some of the Buddhist <br />  images of Sukkhothai and Ayutthaya collection and came to the <br />  conclusion that: a) Some of them were moulded by the Chola sculptors <br />  at Siam in Tanjorian style.</p>
<p>  b) Some of them were costed at Thanjavur, Nagappattinam and brought <br />  to Siam either to their own settlements or to the Thai public or <br />  royalty. Prince Chand Chirayu Rajani, in his book entitled «Thai <br />  imageries of Swarnabhumi Art» mentioned about my view points. The <br />  area of ‘Sitep’ should have been a strong hold of Vaishnavism<br />and of <br />  Indian settlement in Pallava and Chola period. Stanely O’Connor <br />  considers that the ancient architectural and archaeological findings <br />  of Thailand dating from 5th to 9th C.A.D. are all Brahmanical and of <br />  South India. They are of either late Pallava or early Chola in <br />  style. The reclining image of Vishnu, Govarthana lila are also <br />  identified at a dilabitated temple in the eastern part of Thailand. <br />  One Bairava sculpture of Viang Sira confirms the Indian or Brahmin <br />  towns formed in Siam in those period.</p>
<p>  TAMIL BUDDHISM ??" THAI BUDDHISM</p>
<p>  This iconographical, religious and cultural influence of the Cholas <br />  over Thailand was reflected in Thai Buddhism also. Experts used to <br />  classify the Thai Buddhist Bronzes mainly into two categories. They <br />  are</p>
<p>  1) Pallavanised and 2) Cholified ones.</p>
<p>  In cholification the «Nagappattinam bronze casting» technique <br />  (Tanjorian) was highly appreciated and adopted by the Thais.</p>
<p>  RELIGION &amp; PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>  The South Indian philosophy of Hinduism and Buddhism which were <br />  prevailing in the Chola period were also being adopted by the <br />  Siamese which are clearly referred by Pre Rup Stele Inscription and <br />  Prasat Kok Po inscriptions. The South Indian Buddhist Monks like <br />  Vinita Ruci and Vajrabodhi spreaded Buddhism of Chola country in <br />  Siam, Vietnam and Laos.</p>
<p>  RAMAYANA</p>
<p>  Another strong proof of Cholas interaction in Siam is Ramayana. The <br />  Ramakian practised by the Thais are analogous to Cholas Kamba <br />  Ramayanam only and the Mayil Ravanan story is also of South India <br />  (Mayirab Story).</p>
<p>  There are 21 similarities found between Kamba Ramayanan and <br />  Ramakian. For example the love at first sight between Phra Ram and <br />  Nangsidha.</p>
<p>  The Ramayana sculptures of Lobpuri temple wall and of Pimay Buddha <br />  temple depicting the epic with flying Hanuman with Sanjeevi hill, <br />  the fainted Lakhsmana, Building the Sethu bridge by the Monkeys, <br />  nose cut of Surpanaka, defeat of Vali etc. The word «Ramakien» is <br />  only a corrupt form of «Rama Kirthi».</p>
<p>  THIRUPPAVAI - THIRUVEMPAVAI</p>
<p>  Chanting of Thiruppavai and Thiruvempavai by the Thai Brahmins were <br />  also introduced into Thailand by the Cholas only. Some of the <br />  Thevaram like «Mattitta Punnayang Kanal» etc. and Thivya Prapandham <br />  like. ‘Thiru Valuthi Natennum’, «Uyarvara Uyarnalam Udaiyavan»<br />etc <br />  are also being mixed in their chanting. They are quite familiar with <br />  Thiruchitrambalam, Narayaname and Namasivaya. This author was able <br />  to see same Tamil leaf also in the Grantha Palm leaf manuscripts <br />  kept by the Thai Brahmans, which reveals that Tamil was familiar <br />  with the Thai Brahmans in Chola period. They were well versed in <br />  Grantha also. But nowadays without knowing the script and the <br />  meaning, the phonemes were written in Thai script in a corrupt form <br />  and they are chanted.</p>
<p>  Hindu customs and rituals were followed by Thai royalty even in <br />  their coronation ceremony.</p>
<p>  GARUDA</p>
<p>  The image of Garudantika the flying Kite man carrying Vishnu on his <br />  shoulder is familiar with Thailand. (Bangkok Emerald Buddha temple, <br />  Pimay Buddha temple, etc.) G.Deivanayagam The Chola Empire and the <br />  Chao Phraya Delta</p>
<p>  The Chao Phraya Delta: Historical Development, Dynamics and <br />  Challenges of Thailand' Rice Bowl 6</p>
<p>  VISHNU AND RAJA</p>
<p>  The reclaiming Vishnu is identical with Chola country is found in <br />  Siam. Vishnu with two consorts is a Chola’s production which is <br />  being seen in Siam. They are Lakshmi and Pudevi. Pudevi is <br />  considered or treated as Maheswari by the Siamese.</p>
<p>  The Hari-hara (Half Vishnu ??" Half Siva) is flourished among South <br />  Indian smartha Brahmins. The very same practice was in existence at <br />  Siam even in 7th C.A.D. when Esana Varman was ruling Siam. There is <br />  a great saying among the Cholas as follows. «Seeing the king is <br />  seeing the Vishnu» The same concept is seen at Siam. King <br />  Ramathipaty who established the Ayutthaya kingdom calling himself as <br />  Narayana ??" Nara, and ordered for a full fledged annual ceremony in <br />  the Nagara Sri Thammarat.</p>
<p>  THE BRAHMAN TEMPLES</p>
<p>  In the Thai Brahman temple complex of Bangkok a Ganesh temple, Siva <br />  temple and a Vishnu temple are Seen. This Vishnu is being named as <br />  Sugothaya Perumal, typical Tamil name, Sugothayam is the former name <br />  of the Thailand. This name consists of two syllables Suga + Uthayam <br />  that is the «Pleasant dawn». Like Korea the land of morning calm, <br />  Thailand was treated by the Cholas as a land of «Pleasant dawn».</p>
<p>  SWINGS</p>
<p>  The ‘Great Swings’ seen in Thai Brahmin temples and the Swing <br />  festivals (Login wor) are all of South Indian tradition only.</p>
<p>  PAVAAI</p>
<p>  The «Paavai Nonbu» (December and January) was familiar with the <br />  Thais until 1940. Nowadays it has been reduced to a temple ritual.</p>
<p>  RAIN FESTIVAL</p>
<p>  The rain festival and the Mantra Chanting that time are all of Tamil <br />  in tradition. It affirms the loyalty of the people to the king <br />  as «We serve you not only today; but for forth coming 7 births also.</p>
<p>  DEEPAWALI &amp; KARTHIKAI</p>
<p>  Deepavali and Karthikai festivals were also introduced by the Cholas <br />  in Siam. The Karthikai festival is being celebrated as «Malai» <br />  (Thiruvannamalai fire festival) by the Thais. The float festivals of <br />  Thais are also similar with the Tamil Cholas.</p>
<p>  THE THAI CHOLAS</p>
<p>  «The kings of Ayutthaya were proud to call themselves as Cholas» <br />  (Paul Pelliot ??" ‘Encore A Propos Des Voyages De Tcheng Howo’ <br />  Toungpao 1936). The story of the Manu neethi Chola was familiar <br />  among Sugothays and king Ramakongheng had installed a bell for the <br />  public call for justice. (David K.Wyatt 1984 : 54)</p>
<p>  TAMILS AND TAMIL IN THAILAND</p>
<p>  The Tamil people migrated to Siam in the Chola period, slowly lost <br />  their language and culture and mingled with the Thais. But one can <br />  see the Physiological features of this Chola Thais from the <br />  Mongoloid Thai natives.</p>
<p>  The mixing of these Tamils with the Thais long ago also resulted in <br />  influence to the Thai Vocabulary. For Example:</p>
<p>  Tamil Thai English <br />  Thangam Thongam Gold <br />  Kappal Kamban Ship <br />  Malai Male Garland <br />  Krambu Klambu Kurry <br />  Kenty Kently Small vessel <br />  Appa Pa Father  <br />  Thatha Tha Grandfather <br />  Amma Me Mother <br />  Guru Gru Teacher <br />  Asan Asan Teacher <br />  Puttan Puttan Great Grandfather <br />  Puthran Puthru Son  </p>
<p>  And so many others. In addition the days and months names are <br />  similar with the Tamil ones.</p>
<p>  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>  Hence the interactions of the Cholas in the Chao-Phraya Delta which <br />  was named by the Cholas as Meenam treated equally with the Kaveri <br />  river Delta, preferred to settled and considerably influenced the <br />  Thais in all ways of life which excelled even the original Chola <br />  culture by its sober nature.</p>
