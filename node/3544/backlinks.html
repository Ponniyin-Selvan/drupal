<p>Europeans in India<br />India was a British colony. The British left behind them in India a strong imprint of their philosophy and culture and even today it is evident that English which is a foreign language is the most important and respected language in India. But the British were not the only Europeans to arrive in India and have their imprint. Since ancient period even before the beginning of the Christian era there were relations between Europeans and Indians. The main Europeans to arrive in ancient India were Greeks. The Greeks are referred to in ancient Indian history as Yavanas. Even the most famous ancient Greek conqueror, Alexander the Great, arrived in India. But actually he arrived up to the present India-Pakistan border. But there were other Greeks who arrived in India and established kingdoms. Many of these Greek communities later on adopted Hinduism and integrated in the Indian caste system. Even today there are communities in Kashmir who claim to be of Greek origin. Not all<br />Greeks arrived in India to conquer it. There were also Greek scientists who arrived in India for scientific research, especially in astronomy and mathematics. <br />Later on other Europeans arrived in India because of commercial reasons. The Indian sub-continent was then world famous for its spices. But when the Muslim Ottoman Empire of Turkey ruled the Middle East, they caused lots of problems to European Christian merchants who tried to pass through their land. Therefore the Europeans tried to find other routes to reach India. And so accidentally Christopher Columbus found the continent of America. Columbus tried to get to India while sailing westwards from Europe. Columbus presumed that because the earth is round he would eventually get to India while sailing westwards, instead he found the continent of America whose existence was not known then to the Europeans. Columbus thought that he had arrived in India and called the natives Indians. <br />These Europeans at first requested from the local rulers permission to trade in their entities. Later on they requested from the local rulers permission to build factories. After they built factories they requested to build forts around these factories to defend them from pirates and other dangers. Then they requested to recruit local Indians to serve as guards and soldiers in these forts and so on they slowly created their own armies. And so one of the European power's representative, the British East India Company, became the ruler of India.<br />The British control of India was a result of several factors. The Portuguese, who along with their business tried to enforce Roman Catholicism on the Indians were defeated by local rulers sometimes in collaboration with Protestant European powers. But still the Portuguese remained in India with small pockets. Their main center in India was Goa. The Dutch, who had holds in south India and the Danes, who had holds in east India, left India for their own reasons. The two main European powers that remained in India were British and French. These two powers tried different ways to control India and to defeat each other. Each of these European powers sometimes collaborated with local Indian rulers to defeat the other European power. Eventually the British became the rulers of India. But the French like the Portuguese remained in India with small pockets and both these powers remained in India even after the British left India in 1947. <br />The British East India Company was actually a trading company and it received from the British crown charter to trade with the Indian sub-continent. They arrived in India for spice trade in 1600. Like other European powers that arrived in India, they at first requested from the local rulers permission to trade in their entities. The British East India Company was more sophisticated than other Europeans who arrived in India. This company offered different sophisticated agreements to the different Indian ruling families, which made them the actual managers of the Indian kingdoms. They sometimes used their army against local rulers and annexed their territories with the result that there was lot of embitterment among the Indians against the British. After the 'Indian Mutiny' of 1857, the British Crown took back the charter from the East India Company and ruled India directly through a Viceroy. The British gave India independence in 1947, but its last soldier left India<br />eventually in 1950. The French also left India in 1950. The Portuguese were the last to leave India in 1961. <br />Even though the European powers arrived in India for commercial reasons, they also started converting local Indians to Christianity. Of the five European powers the Portuguese were most enthusiastic to baptize Indians. The Portuguese inspired by the Pope&#146;s order to baptize people around the world not only fought wars against the local Indian rulers, but also they tried to enforce their Roman Catholic prayers on Syrian Christians who were in India before the modern European powers arrived in India After many wars the Portuguese were defeated by local rulers and they had only one big pocket of control in India, Goa. Goa was made the capital of Portuguese colonies in the eastern hemisphere. The Portuguese not only fought the Indian rulers, but they also fought against other European powers in India especially Dutch and English. Many Portuguese churches in Kerala were converted into English and Dutch churches after they were captured by these powers. <br />The English missionaries started acting in India at a much later period. The British arrived in India in 1600 and they allowed the missionaries to enter their territory only from 1813. The British allowed different churches to establish missionaries in their territory. The missionaries didn&#146;t only spread Christianity, but they also did humanitarian deeds giving the needy the basic necessities of life like food, clothes and shelter. The missionaries also built schools in India and many of them exist even today and have Christian or European originated names. <br />The British church missionaries succeeded less than the Portuguese in converting Indians to Christianity, but unlike the Portuguese who tried to enforce Christianity, these Protestant converts were voluntary. The Portuguese were also aware of the Indian custom according to which the wife followed her husband&#146;s faith and therefore married their men to Indian women. Most of the Portuguese baptized Christians in India have Portuguese oriented surnames, like Fernandez, De Silva, De Costa and others. <br />=========================================================<br />INDIA since independence<br />India was a British colony. It earned its independence from the British on 15/08/1947. Day before that Pakistan which was created as a result of partition of British India was established and flanked on two sides of India: West Pakistan which is called today Pakistan, and east Pakistan, now an independent state called Bangladesh. After its independence, the political leaders of India adopted the liberal democratic system for the country.<br />Since its independence, India has transformed a lot. When India attained independence in 1947, its population was around 400 million people. Now there are billion people in India. India is the largest democracy in the world. It has the biggest number of people with franchise rights and the largest number of political parties, which take part in election campaign.<br />Before its independence, India was never a single country but a bunch of different entities. Many predicted that India, because of diversities in its cultures, religion, languages, castes, manners, local histories, nationalities and identities, would not survive as a single democratic country, but would break up into smaller countries. <br />Since independence, India had many political problems. During independence the most burning issues were the riots between the Hindus and Muslims while the Sikhs were siding with Hindus. Another issue was convincing the Princely states not to declare independence or join Pakistan but to join the Indian Union. India also had a few wars with its neighbors on border issues. <br />India also has many internal problems. Different communities with different identities - regional, language, caste, religion - demanded different rights for their communities. Some communities demanded more autonomy for their cultures within the Indian states. Others demanded autonomous states within the Indian Union, while the others demanded to be independent from India.<br />With all its problems India survives as a single state with democratic character.<br />The creation of Indian identity<br />The building of Indian identity began sometime in the beginning of the 19th century during the British rule over the Indian sub-continent. Before its independence in 1947, India was never one nation but always a collection of different entities and cultures with no sense of identity.</p>
<p>In different parts of India different cultures, manners and languages existed. Different rulers ruled different parts of India. Some of them were foreigners. The only features common to the large portion of India's residents were some of the Hindu religious customs and taboos like caste system, child marriages and other religious oriented customs. </p>
<p>The new Indian identity was a combination of the intentions of the Indians to change the traditional Indian society and the nationalist Indian feeling which, developed later on because of the British oppression of the Indians.</p>
<p>==========================================================<br />The creation of India<br />In 1945 the war was over. The Allied forces, of which the British were part of, won in this war. Winston Churchill who was the Prime Minister of UK was a great hero. In that year elections occurred in England. Churchill hoped to win again in these elections.</p>
<p>He and his Conservative Party supported the continuation of British Empire and British rule over India. On the other hand the Labour Party claimed it was time to end the British Empire. In these elections the Labour Party won and it became clear the British would leave India. <br />At this stage different communities in India began demanding from the British to establish in India a state or states according to their political philosophies. </p>
<p>The British who ruled India through the policy of 'divide and rule' did every thing possible during their rule over India to separate and even incite the different communities of India and so vivified different nationalistic feelings. The Indian National Congress wanted to establish a secular state all over British India. The Hindu Mahasabha wanted to establish a Hindu state all over British India.<br />The sikhs demanded a separate Sikh entity in the Punjab region. The dravideans wanted an independent Dravidstan in south India. </p>
<p>The Tamils, who are part of Dravidian culture, demanded an independent Tamil state. The princely states of Hyderabad and Kashmir demanded independence. Of the different lobbies, the lobby that succeeded to most in achieving their demands was the Muslim League. <br />The Muslim League demanded a Muslim state in regions where there was a muslim majority. </p>
<p>Muhammad Jinnah who was the leader of the Muslim League is blamed by the Indians as responsible for the partition of India. The Indians blame Jinnah that he evoked Muslim nationalistic feelings among the Indian Muslims and so causing the riots all over India, between the Hindus and Sikhs on one side and the Muslims on the other. Until then they claimed the Hindus and the Muslims lived peacefully side by side. In these riots which occurred in British India, hundreds of thousands of people died. <br />The British who at first intended to leave India as one country, decided because of these riots to establish two states in British India, India and Pakistan. The British transferred India's administration to the indian national congress and Pakistan's administration to the Muslim League. The British also decided that the Princely States would join either country according to two criterions 1) wish of the people 2) wish of the ruler. </p>
<p>When the British left India there were 562 Princely states in British India and 11 provinces. </p>
<p>The Indian politician responsible in convincing the Princely States to join India was Vallabhai Patel. Patel was the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India. He was a senior member of the Congress and was very popular among the Indian people. </p>
<p>He could have been the first Prime Minister of India, but Mahatma Gandhi wanted the young Jawarharlal Nehru to be India's first Prime Minister and therefore Patel withdrew his candidacy.<br />On 15/08/1947 India achieved its independence with Jawarharlal Nehru as its first Prime Minister. </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Aryans and Dravidians - A controversial issue</p>
<p>The most basic division of the Indian society is of Aryans and <br />Dravidians. According to this division, nearly 72% of Indians are <br />Aryans and 28% are Dravidians. <br />The north Indians are the descendants of Aryans and the south <br />Indians are Dravidians. <br />The languages spoken in five states of south India are considered <br />Dravidian languages and most of the languages spoken in the north <br />are considered Aryan languages. </p>
<p>The general script of the Aryan languages is different from the <br />general script of Dravidian languages. The Indians also distinguish <br />themselves by the general north Indian accent and general south <br />Indian accent.</p>
<p>According to general Indian legend, the Aryans arrived in north <br />India somewhere from Iran and southern Russia at around 1500 BC. <br />Before the Aryans, the Dravidian people resided in India. The Aryans <br />disregarded the local cultures. </p>
<p>They began conquering and taking control over regions in north India <br />and at the same time pushed the local people southwards or towards <br />the jungles and mountains in north India. According to this <br />historical fact the general division of Indian society is made. <br />North Indians are Aryans and south Indians are Dravidians. But this <br />division isn't proper because of many reasons.</p>
<p>Many Indians immigrated from one part of India to other parts of <br />India and not all local people of north India were pushed southwards <br />by the Aryans. Some stayed and served the Aryans and others moved to <br />live in the forests and the jungles of north India. </p>
<p>Before the arrival of the Aryans there were also other communities <br />in India like Sino-Mongoloids and Austroloids. There were also other <br />foreign immigrations and invaders who arrived in India, from time to <br />time. </p>
<p>There are many that completely doubt that there was ever any Aryan <br />invasion in India. This skepticism is based on the dating of the <br />Aryan invasion of India and the fact that Hinduism and the caste <br />system are believed to have been established as the result of the <br />meetings between the intruding Aryans and original residents of <br />India, the Dravidians.</p>
<p>The caste system is believed to have been established by the Aryans. <br />The fair skinned Aryans who occupied parts of India established the <br />caste system, which allowed only them to be the priests (Brahman), <br />aristocracy (Kshatria) and the businessmen (Vaisia) of the society. <br />Below them in hierarchy were the Sudras who consisted of two <br />communities. </p>
<p>One community was of the locals who were subdued by the Aryans and <br />the other were the descendants of Aryans with locals. In Hindu <br />religious stories there are many wars between the good Aryans and <br />the dark skinned demons and devils. </p>
<p>The different Gods also have dark skinned slaves. There are stories <br />of demon women trying to seduce good Aryan men in deceptive ways. <br />There were also marriages between Aryan heroes and demon women. Many <br />believe that these incidences really occurred in which, the gods and <br />the positive heroes were people of Aryan origin. </p>
<p>And the demons, the devils and the dark skinned slaves were in fact <br />the original residence of India whom the Aryans coined as monsters, <br />devil, demons and slaves. Normally the date given to Aryan invasion <br />is around 1500 BC. But according to Hinduism experts some of the <br />events in Hinduism occurred much earlier. Some of the events like <br />the great war in the Mahabharta epic is believed to have occurred <br />(based on astronomical research) 7000 years ago. </p>
<p>According to this Hindu experts the word Aryan is a <br />misinterpretation of the original Sanskrit word, Arya. Arya means <br />pure or good in Sanskrit. In the holy Vedas the good people were <br />called Arya. Some of the European scholars of Indian culture in the <br />19th century were Germans. These German scholars who found that <br />Swastika was also a holy symbol among the Hindus distorted, the word <br />Arya to Aryan. </p>

        <p>2,300-year-old artefacts may change Ashoka-Buddhist history The Organiser, July 9 2006 Issue BHUBANESWAR, India -- Orissa Institute of Maritime and South East Asian Studies (OIMSEAS) has unearthed some 2,300-year-old artefacts at Jajpur district in Orissa, which, it claimed, could change some historical narratives on the Ashokan period.</p>
<p>The description of Chinese pilgrim Hieun-Tsang about Ashoka that he had constructed 10 stupas in Odra country where Buddha had preached may come true.<br />Earlier, historians refused to accept the narrative. We have already analysed five stupas and found three more similar structures,&#148; OIMSEAS Director Debaraj Pradhan told mediapersons here. He said a huge inscribed monolithic stupa along with other remnants of Buddhist establishments had been detected on top of Panturi hill in Jajpur district.<br />The current explorations and excavations are unique since nowhere in India will you find old artefacts in such a small area,&#148; Pradhan said. The stupas were found at Langudi, Tarapur, Deuli Kayama hills, Neulipur, Bajragiri, Kantigadia and Panturi.<br />The organisation had extensively surveyed the Brahmani-Kelua river valley since 1996 to explore and excavate Buddhist sites. It had excavated Langudi hill site and discovered ancient Pushpagiri Vihara, an Ashokan stupa, two rare statues believed to be that of Emperor Ashoka himself, besides 54 rock-cut votive stupas, five Dhyani Buddha statues and remains of two monasteries.<br />The excavation of the fort of Radhanagar indicated that it could be the ancient capital of Kalinga, Pradhan, also the curator of state archaeology, said.<br />Either it could be Dantapura mentioned in Ceylonese literature Datha-Ddhatu-Vamsa or Tosali mentioned in special Dhauli rock edict of Ashoka,&#148; he said.<br />The artefacts discovered from last year&#146;s excavation established that Radhanagar or Tosali was a fort city. But interesting findings of this year indicated that it could be a port city.<br />The discovery of Roman Bullae (an earthen ornament) and Roman Rowlletted pottery suggested that the place had connections with Rome. And it could not have happened, had Tosali not been a port city,&#148; Pradhan said. He, however, made it clear that only around five per cent of the total excavation had been completed.<br />Once we excavate the entire archaeologically-rich area in Jajpur district, we would be able to come to a concrete conclusion,&#148; he said. Besides discovery of Ashokan period artefacts, archaeologists have also stumbled upon many antiques, which implies that the whole area could have been a hub of religious activities.<br />The current excavation also threw up broken Buddhist images, votive stupas and collection of pottery remains from the surface near Vajragiri.<br />Pradhan said Vajragiri could have had close cultural relations with Japan because the highest temple of Japan was the Vajragiri temple (Kongobu-Ji) at Kuito, the ancient capital of that country.<br />Interestingly, at the foot of the present Vajragiri a big ancient village Kotpur was situated, he said and added that more research is necessary to establish the connection.<br />The Vajragiri excavation had yielded one piece of stone trident, designed religious lamps 12 pieces of heavy iron rods and two pieces of conch in good condition.<br />Pradhan said most of the inscriptional evidence and its photographs have been sent to Dr K.V. Ramesh, retired director of epigraphy at Mysore, for deciphering.<br />The present inscriptional evidence may prove the association of Buddha with Kayama hill in Kalinga country in his lifetime,&#148; he said.<br />Meanwhile, Orissa Culture Minister Suryanarayan Patro has directed Jajpur District Collector Aurobindo Padhi to visit all hills identified by OIMSEAS and involve eminent historians in the research work. </p>

<p>Indian History <http://adaniel.tripod.com/history.htm  </p>
<p>Europeans in India</p>
<p>India was a British colony. The British left behind them in India a<br />strong imprint of their philosophy and culture and even today it is<br />evident that English which is a foreign language is the most important<br />and respected language in India. But the British were not the only<br />Europeans to arrive in India and have their imprint. Since ancient<br />period even before the beginning of the Christian era there were<br />relations between Europeans and Indians. The main Europeans to arrive in<br />ancient India were Greeks. The Greeks are referred to in ancient Indian<br />history as Yavanas. Even the most famous ancient Greek conqueror,<br />Alexander the Great, arrived in India. Bu t actually he arrived up to<br />the present India-Pakistan border. But there were other Greeks who<br />arrived in India and established kingdoms. Many of these Greek<br />communities later on adopted Hinduism<br /><http://adaniel.tripod.com/hinduism.htm  and integrated in the Indian<br />caste system <http://adaniel.tripod.com/castes.htm  . Even today there<br />are communities in Kashmir who claim to be of Greek origin. Not all<br />Greeks arrived in India to conquer it. There were also Greek scientists<br />who arrived in India for scientific research, especially in astronomy<br />and mathematics. </http://adaniel.tripod.com/castes.htm></http://adaniel.tripod.com/hinduism.htm></p>
<p>Later on other Europeans arrived in India because of commercial reasons.<br />The Indian sub-continent was then world famous for its spices. But when<br />the Muslim Ottoman Empire of Turkey ruled the Middle East, they caused<br />lots of problems to European Christian merchants who tried to pass<br />through the ir land. Therefore the Europeans tried to find other routes<br />to reach India. And so accidentally Christopher Columbus found the<br />continent of America. Columbus tried to get to India while sailing<br />westwards from Europe. Columbus presumed that because the earth is round<br />he would eventually get to India while sailing westwards, instead he<br />found the continent of America whose existence was not known then to the<br />Europeans. Columbus thought that he had arrived in India and called the<br />natives Indians. </p>
<p>namely English, French, Dutch, Danish and Portuguese. Among these<br />European powers the Portuguese arrived first in India in 1498 via sea<br />after they had circled the whole of the African continent. These<br />representatives arrived in India after they received from their country<br />rulers charter to do business with India. </p>
<p>These Europeans at first requested from the local rulers permission to<br />trade in their entities. Later on they requested from the local rulers<br />permission to build factories. After they built factories they requested<br />to build forts around these factories to defend them from pirates and<br />other dangers. Then they requested to recruit local Indians to serve as<br />guards and soldiers in these forts and so on they slowly created their<br />own armies. And so one of the European power's representative, the<br />British East India Company, became the ruler of India.</p>
<p>The British control of India was a result of several factors. The<br />Portuguese, who along with their business tried to enforce Roman<br />Catholicism on the Indians were defeated by local rulers sometimes in<br />collaboration with Protestant European powers. But still the Portuguese<br />remained in India with small pockets. Their main center in India was<br />Goa. The Dutch, who had holds in south India and the Danes, who had<br />holds in east India, left India for their own reasons. The two main<br />European powers that remained in India were British and French. These<br />two powers tried different ways to control India and to defeat each<br />other. Each of these European powers sometimes collaborated with local<br />Indian rulers to defeat the other European power. Eventually the British<br />became the rulers of India. But the French like the Portuguese remained<br />in India with small pockets and both these powers remained in India even<br />after the British left India in 1947. </p>
<p>The British East India Company was actually a trading company and it<br />received from the British crown charter to trade with the Indian<br />sub-continent. They arrived in India for spice trade in 1600. Like other<br />European powers that arrived in India, they at first requested from the<br />local rulers permission to trade in their entities. The British East<br />India Company was more sophisticated than other Europeans who arrived in<br />India. This company offered different sophisticated agreements to the<br />different Indian ruling families, which made them the actual managers of<br />the Indian kingdoms. They sometimes used their army against local rulers<br />and annexed their territories with the result that there was lot of<br />embitterment among the Indians against the British. After the 'Indian<br />Mutiny' of 1857, the British Crown took back the charter from the East<br />India Company and ruled India directly through a Viceroy. The British<br />gave India independence in 1947, but its last soldier left India<br />eventually in 1950. The French also left India in 1950. The Portuguese<br />were the last to leave India in 1961. </p>
<p>Even though the European powers arrived in India for commercial reasons,<br />they also started converting local Indians to Christianity. Of the five<br />European powers the Portuguese were most enthusiastic to baptize<br />Indians. The Portuguese inspired by the Pope's order to baptize people<br />around the world not only fought wars against the local Indian rulers,<br />but also they tried to enforce their Roman Catholic prayers on Syrian<br />Christians who were in India before the modern European powers arrived<br />in India  </p>
<p>After many wars the Portuguese were defeated by local rulers and they<br />had only one big pocket of control in India, Goa. Goa was made the<br />capital of Portuguese colonies in the eastern hemisphere. The Portuguese<br />not only fought the Indian rulers, but they also fought against other<br />European powers in India especially Dutch and English. Many Portuguese<br />churches in Kerala were converted into English and Dutch churches after<br />they were captured by these powers. <br />The English missionaries started acting in India at a much l ater<br />period. The British arrived in India in 1600 and they allowed the<br />missionaries to enter their territory only from 1813. The British<br />allowed different churches to establish missionaries in their territory.<br />The missionaries didn't only spread Christianity, but they also did<br />humanitarian deeds giving the needy the basic necessities of life like<br />food, clothes and shelter. The missionaries also built schools in India<br />and many of them exist even today and have Christian or European<br />originated names. </p>
<p>The British church missionaries succeeded less than the Portuguese in<br />converting Indians to Christianity, but unlike the Portuguese who tried<br />to enforce Christianity, these Protestant converts were voluntary. The<br />Portuguese were also aware of the Indian custom according to which the<br />wife followed her husband's faith and therefore married their men to<br />Indian women. Most of the Portuguese baptized Christians in India have<br />Portuguese oriented surnames, like Fernandez, De Silva, De Costa and<br />others. </p>
<p>=========================================================</p>
<p>INDIA since independence</p>
<p>India was a British colony. It earned its independence from the British<br />on 15/08/1947. Day before that Pakistan which was created as a result of<br />partition of British India was established and flanked on two sides of<br />India: West Pakistan which is called today Pakistan, and east Pakistan,<br />now an independent state called Bangladesh. After its independence, the<br />political leaders of India adopted the liberal democratic system for the<br />country.<br />Since its independence, India has transformed a lot. When India attained<br />independence in 1947, its population was around 400 million people. Now<br />there are billion people in India. India is the largest democracy in the<br />world. It has the biggest number of people with fr anchise rights and<br />the largest number of political parties,<br /><http://adaniel.tripod.com/parties.htm  which take part in election<br />campaign.<br />Before its independence, India was never a single country but a bunch of<br />different entities. Many predicted that India, because of diversities in<br />its cultures, religion <http://adaniel.tripod.com/religions.htm  ,<br />languages <http://adaniel.tripod.com/Languages.htm  , castes<br /><http://adaniel.tripod.com/castes.htm  , manners, local histories<br /><http://adaniel.tripod.%0d%0a%20com/india-past.htm  , nationalities and<br />identities, would not survive as a single democratic country, but would<br />break up into smaller countries. <br />Since independence, India had many political problems. During<br />independence the most burning issues were the riots between the Hindus<br /><http://adaniel.tripod.com/hinduism.htm  and Muslims<br /><http://adaniel.tripod.com/Islam.htm  while the Sikhs<br /><http://adaniel.tripod.com/sikhism.htm  were siding with Hindus.<br />Another issue was convincing the Princely states not to declare<br />independence or join Pakistan but to join the Indian Union. India also<br />had a few wars with its neighbors on border issues. <br />India also has many internal problems. Different communities with<br />different identities - regional, language, caste, religion - demanded<br />different rights for their communities. Some communities demanded more<br />autonomy for their cultures within the Indian states. Others demanded<br />autonomous states within the Indian Union, while the others demanded to<br />be independent from India.<br />With all its problems India survives as a single state with democratic<br />character.</http://adaniel.tripod.com/sikhism.htm></http://adaniel.tripod.com/islam.htm></http://adaniel.tripod.com/hinduism.htm></http://adaniel.tripod.%0d%0a%20com/india-past.htm></http://adaniel.tripod.com/castes.htm></http://adaniel.tripod.com/languages.htm></http://adaniel.tripod.com/religions.htm></http://adaniel.tripod.com/parties.htm></p>
<p>The creation of Indian identity</p>
<p>The building of Indian identity began sometime in the beginning of the<br />19th century during the British rule over the Indian sub-continent.<br />Before its independence in 1947, India was never one nation but always a<br />collection of different entities and cultures with no sense of identity.</p>
<p>In different parts of India different cultures, manners and languages<br />existed. Different rulers ruled different parts of India. Some of them<br />were foreigners. The only features common to the large portion of<br />India's residents were some of the Hindu religious customs and taboos<br />like caste system, child marriages and other religious oriented customs.</p>
<p>The building of the Indian identity actually began as a social reform<br />movement with an intention to change the traditional Hindu/Indian<br />society. The Indian independence issue was not at first the main issue.<br />ruler over India. Later on a general feeling of an oppressed nation<br />subjected to a foreign powe r arose among the Indians including the<br />non-Hindus. </p>
<p>The new Indian identity was a combination of the intentions of the<br />Indians to change the traditional Indian society and the nationalist<br />Indian feeling which, developed later on because of the British<br />oppression of the Indians.</p>
<p>========================================================== </p>
<p>The creation of India</p>
<p>In 1945 the war was over. The Allied forces, of which the British were<br />part of, won in this war. Winston Churchill who was the Prime Minister<br />of UK was a great hero. In that year elections occurred in England.<br />Churchill hoped to win again in these elections.</p>
<p>He and his Conservative Party supported the continuation of Brit ish<br />Empire and British rule over India. On the other hand the Labour Party<br />claimed it was time to end the British Empire. In these elections the<br />Labour Party won and it became clear the British would leave India. </p>
<p>At this stage different communities in India began demanding from the<br />British to establish in India a state or states according to their<br />political philosophies. </p>
<p>The British who ruled India through the policy of 'divide and rule' did<br />every thing possible during their rule over India to separate and even<br />incite the different communities of India and so vivified different<br />nationalistic feelings. The Indian National Congress wanted to establish<br />a secular state all over British India. The Hindu Mahasabha wanted to<br />establish a Hindu state all over British India.</p>
<p>The sikhs demanded a separate Sikh entity in the Punjab region. The<br />dravideans wanted an independent Dravidstan in south India. </p>
<p>The Tamils, who are part of Dravidian culture, demanded an independent<br />Tamil state. The princely states of Hyderabad and Kashmir demanded<br />independence. Of the different lobbies, the lobby that succeeded to most<br />in achieving their demands was the Muslim League. </p>
<p>The Muslim League demanded a Muslim state in regions where there was a<br />muslim majority. </p>
<p>Muhammad Jinnah who was the leader of the Muslim League is blamed by the<br />Indians as responsible for the partition of India. The Indians blame<br />Jinnah that he evoked Muslim nationalistic feelings among the Indian<br />Muslims and so causing the riots all over India, between the Hindus and<br />Sikhs on one side and the Muslims on the other. Until then they claimed<br />the Hindus and the Muslims lived peacefully side by side. In these riots<br />which occurred in British India, hundreds of thousands of people died. </p>
<p>The British who at first intended to leave India as one country, decided<br />because of these riots to establish two states in British India, India<br />and Pakistan. The British transferred India's administration to the<br />indian national congress and Pakistan's administration to the Muslim<br />League. The British also decided that the Princely States would join<br />either country according to two criterions 1) wish of the people 2) wish<br />of the ruler. </p>
<p>When the British left India there were 562 Princely states in British<br />India and 11 provinces. </p>
<p>The Indian politician responsible in convincing the Princely States to<br />join India was Vallabhai Patel. Patel was the first Home Minister and<br />Deputy Prime Minister of India. He was a senior member of the Congress<br />and was very popular among the Indian people. </p>
<p>He could have been the first Prime Minister of India, but Mahatma Gandhi<br />wanted the young Jawarharlal Nehru to be India's first Prime Minister<br />and therefore Patel withdrew his candidacy.</p>
<p>On 15/08/1947 India achieved its independence with Jawarharlal Nehru as<br />its first Prime Minister. </p>
