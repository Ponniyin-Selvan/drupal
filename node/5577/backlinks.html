<blockquote><p>    If temples are meant for worship, four walls and a roof is <br />enough. <br />  Why <br />    multi-storeys and beautiful sculptures? Can we take out upper <br />floor <br />    stones for building forts and dams? Single floor will be <br />  comparatively <br />    safer for devotees than multiple floors. Isn't it? ;-)</p>
<p>  Hi<br />  exactly<br />  there comes the ego of the builder.<br />  20 feet lingams and 216 feet vimanams, and naming the temple after <br />  himself.<br />  know who I am talking about.<br />  venketesh<br />==============================</p></blockquote>
<p>Let us consider the matters on hand :</p>
<p>1. Whether Temples give History ?</p>
<p>The inscriptions talk most of the grants made to the temple. SI <br />inscriptions, Epigraphia Indica, State volumes, Avanam, Valarau, <br />Temple, The Cholas, Pallavar Varalaru etc., are written based on <br />these data only. Copper plates are also furnish similar data.</p>
<p>Alternative is Literature.. which are considered to contain more <br />flattery.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the absense of recording of data in Temple, we will be <br />left with only Literature.</p>
<p>2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder :</p>
<p>Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders have <br />constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including the one <br />indicated here.</p>
<p>Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive ..  <br />Involvement .. Or if EGO is interpreted as fitting the gradeure of <br />the Builder with the combination of Motive and Involvement, then may <br />be EGO is not the wrong selection.</p>
<p>Then how are we going to explain the Monolithics in Srilanka (which <br />Kalki describes) and our Sravanabelaguda in neighbourhood state?</p>
<p>3. Single story / Multi-storied structure ::</p>
<p>A detailed study on Ancient Temples would provide us data that :</p>
<p>i) Apart from being place of worship, they were cultural centres; ii) Provided employment to several<br />iii) inscriptions show that they served as Registrar office<br />iv) place of safeguarding food-produces<br />v) Sheltering the needy during calamities<br />vi) Served as Banks during Famine / Flood<br />vii) Presence of Government establishment (as MANDRAMs were <br />held under the shade of Trees only )- linked the Village / Panchyat <br />with the Central Establishment at the Throne level.<br />viii) Entertainment<br />ix) Associated with Educational Establishments </p>
<p>4. Place of worship is hardly multi-storied - except in certain <br />Vinnagarams .. Nindran - irundhan - Kidanthan type (like <br />Thiruveezhimizhalai, Thirukottiyur, Uthiramerur Sundraraja Perumal <br />etc.).. Re Big Temple, pls read concept of the temple in the <br />archieves.</p>
<p>Now the Vimanams on the top of main deity served are not that tall <br />and are defined for devine purpose. The Gopurams at the Entrance <br />also served as Check post - overseeing any invasion / intrusion.</p>
<p>This morning in JAYA TV a programme related to Siva-ottam (Siva run) <br />covering about 12 temples around Kanyakumari wherein Siva - Narayana <br />are the presiding deities and the devotees (more than 100 in <br />numbers) commence the run for 100 Kms distance chanting Siva &amp; <br />Narayana on the previous day of Sivarathri day/nite and conclude <br />Sivarathri night!</p>
<p>Thanks for the opportunity to bring out this harmony.</p>

<p>Thiruvalanchuzhi Kabardeswarar @ Sadaimudinathar Temple is very <br />special temple. There is a Kshetrabalar temple in this complex.  <br />This contains very rare inscriptions :</p>
<p>1. A grant by Madevadigal d/o <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym . Only Other temple where she <br />figures is Thiruvayaru.<br />2. <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  performed "THILAPARVATHAM" pukkaruli in his 3rd Yr/ <br />coregented to 29th <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym 's year. This data is important.<br />3. In the Siva temple complex an inscription depicting <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym  <br />as "Sivasaranasekaran" is found.</acronym></acronym></acronym></acronym></p>
<p>For the past 2 / 3 years, this Temple complex is being renovated and <br />fortunately I could get associated in small way to Kshetrabalar <br />temple.</p>
<p>Dr. Kalaikkovan &amp; Dr. Nalini have taken pains and published the new-<br />found inscriptions in Valanchuzhi Vaanar book and Varalaaru book. </p>
<p>During renovation, certain insctions were cemented / plastered or <br />painted affecting History data.</p>
<p>Overall the Jt Commissioner/ HR&amp;CE, <acronym title="Archaeological Survey of India" ASI</acronym  Team, local temple <br />authorities were very much helpful.</acronym></p>
<p>The Kumbabishekam of this temple is being conducted on Monday, the <br />17th March 2008.</p>

        <p>Eric had classified astral beings to Gods, which is apparently a short <br />view based out of western beliefs, his work was commendable as he <br />plored into the areas of unknown. There are various levels of beings <br />(according to some theories) which are superior to men.<br />Humans (all classifications from regular to saints) -- Gandharvas -- <br />Celestial beings - Devas - Tri Murthi - Param porul.</p>
<p>Visits by not just Gandharvas but various other celestial and parallel <br />world beings have been well documented in many scriptures (deja vu is <br />termed as one such concept. A thirupugazh song on wuthirameroor also <br />describes people from other planets.</p>
<p>Lord Rama, was from the sun god clan, egyptian kings were also from Rah <br />and Cholas claiming from the same are no different, truth is we are all <br />from the Sun :-) That would be the essence of Aaditya hridyam, to <br />invole the component inside us that recharges itself from the sun..</p>

<blockquote><p>    The Chola History we read today is based on these THREE PRIMARY <br />    SOURCES only.</p>
<p>  I guess SPS meant history we read today "in text books". Outside <br />  school and university text books, hell a lot of books are <br />published <br />  by individuals and research centres on Cholas. Going through these <br />  books will help us to realise that Cholas were not as small as we <br />  think. </p>
<p>  Such a list is given in the below article by Dr.R.Kalaikkovan.</p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.varalaar" title="http://www.varalaar">http://www.varalaar</a> u.com/Default. asp?articleid= 520</p>
<p>  This article says that the book 'ARUNMOZHI' published by Tamilnadu <br />  State Archaeology Department contains more than 20 articles apart <br />  from more than 200 well researched articles on Cholas and not <br />  struggling just after the 10th page.<br />============ ========= ========= ========= =</p></blockquote>
<p>I meant the History we read in the School Books.. undoubtedly.</p>
<p>I also intended something else.</p>

<p>Aryan - Dravidian theories of past ..<br />Sind and Southern civilisations etc.,<br />Brahmi - Asoka Brahmi scripts.. etc.</p>
<p>To the limited purpose of discussion in our Group, it is becoming <br />essential to take a closer look at primary sources themselves .. as <br />the HISTORY WRITERs are INTERPRETING data and Interpretations <br />vary .. vastly.</p>
<p>As Venkat suggested, if we take a look at Thiruvalgadu copper plate <br />and interpret, we can suggest ourselves some astonishing <br />interpretations. .</p>
<p>I meant that hidden current only.</p>
<p>Actually I am trying to get a copy of the book Arumozhi published by <br />State Archeology.</p>

Isn't it? ;-)<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exactly<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there comes the ego of the builder.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 20 feet lingams and 216 feet vimanams, and naming the temple <BR &gt; &gt; after <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know who I am talking about.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; venketesh<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; ============ ========= =========<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Let us consider the matters on hand :<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Whether Temples give History<br />?<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; The inscriptions talk most of the grants made to the <BR temple. <BR &gt; SI <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; inscriptions, Epigraphia Indica, State volumes, Avanam, <BR Valarau, <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Temple, The Cholas, Pallavar Varalaru etc., are written based <BR on <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; these data only. Copper plates are also furnish similar data.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Alternative is Literature.. which are considered to <BR contain <BR &gt; &gt; more <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; flattery.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, in the absense of recording of data in Temple, we <BR will <BR &gt; &gt; be <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; left withonly Literature.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder :<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of puttingNO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders <BR have <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including <BR the<br /><BR &gt; &gt; one <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; indicated here.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive .. <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Involvement .. Or if EGO is interpreted as fitting the <BR gradeure <BR &gt; of <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; the Builder with the combinationof Motive and Involvement, <BR then <BR &gt; &gt; may <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; be EGO is not the wrong selection.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Thenhow are we going to explain the Monolithics in Srilanka <BR &gt; (which <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Kalki describes) and our Sravanabelaguda in neighbourhood <BR state?<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Single story / Multi-storied structure ::<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; A detailed study on Ancient Temples would provide us data <BR that :<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt;&gt; &gt; i) Apart from being place of worship, they were cultural <BR &gt; &gt; centres;<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; ii) Provided employment to<br />several<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; iii) inscriptions show that they served as Registrar office<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; iv) place of safeguarding food-produces<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; v) Sheltering the needy during calamities<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; vi) Served as Banks during Famine / Flood<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; vii) Presence of Government establishment (as MANDRAMs <BR were <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; held under the shade of Trees only )- linked the Village / <BR &gt; Panchyat <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; with the Central Establishment at the Throne level.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; viii) Entertainment<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; ix) Associated with Educational Establishments <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Place of worship is hardly multi-storied - except in <BR certain <BR &gt;&gt; &gt; Vinnagarams .. Nindran - irundhan - Kidanthan type (like <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Thiruveezhimizhalai , Thirukottiyur, Uthiramerur Sundraraja <BR &gt; Perumal <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; etc.).. Re Big Temple, pls read<br />concept of the temple in the <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; archieves.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Now the Vimanams on the top of main deity served are not that <BR &gt; tall <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; and are defined for devine purpose. The Gopurams at the <BR Entrance <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; also served as Checkpost - overseeing any invasion / <BR intrusion.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt;&gt; &gt; This morning in JAYA TV a programme related to Siva-ottam <BR (Siva <BR &gt; &gt; run) <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; covering about 12 temples around Kanyakumari wherein Siva - <BR &gt; &gt; Narayana <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; are the presiding deities and the devotees (more than 100 in <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; numbers) commence the run for 100 Kms distance chanting Siva &amp; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Narayana on the previous day of Sivarathri day/nite and <BR conclude <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Sivarathri night!<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the opportunity to bring out this harmony.<BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; regards / <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; <BR &gt; &gt; &gt; sps<BR &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR &gt; &gt;<BR &gt;<BR <BR </P </DIV </DIV </BLOCKQUOTE </td </tr </table <br </p />

<p>Amazing numbers!!!</p>
<blockquote><p>  without the copper plates was writing the chola history to this <br />  level atleast possible?</p></blockquote>
<p>Possible. Copper plates are yet another medium of recording grants. <br />Some basic info was found in these plates and info found in <br />inscriptions helped to eloborate. Basic outline of chola history is <br />possible with copper plates, but without inscriptions, this much <br />elobarate history couldnt have been written.</p>
<blockquote><p>  The Chola History we read today is based on these THREE PRIMARY <br />  SOURCES only.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess SPS meant history we read today "in text books". Outside <br />school and university text books, hell a lot of books are published <br />by individuals and research centres on Cholas. Going through these <br />books will help us to realise that Cholas were not as small as we <br />think. </p>
<p>Such a list is given in the below article by Dr.R.Kalaikkovan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=520" title="http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=520">http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=520</a></p>
<p>This article says that the book 'ARUNMOZHI' published by Tamilnadu <br />State Archaeology Department contains more than 20 articles apart <br />from more than 200 well researched articles on Cholas and not <br />struggling just after the 10th page.</p>

<p>  VENKATESH is NONE OTHER than (Anusha) Venkatesh, who has scribed <br />and <br />  published the Sequel to Ponniyinselvan in the form of KAVIRI <br />  MAINDHAN ... Hailing from / associated with the families of <br />  Heriditary Trustees of temples like Chidambaram, Thirubengadu, <br />  Kalayarkoil, Rameswaram etc.</p>
<p>  The question is put forth to summarise the discussions we have had <br />  in the past in our Group.</p>
<p>  LET ME MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER ::</p>

<p>    Hi SPS</p>
<p>    just a few questions<br />   ============================</p>
<p>  what percentage of inscriptions on temples have been copied on to <br />  paper in the major temples.</p>
<p>  According to ASI Sources, out of about 110000 copied / estempaged <br />  pages are lying unpublished in Mysore for the past 50 years !</p>
<p>  (Why Mysore ? That ASI official was stationed at OOTY and when <br />shut <br />  down in 1960s for his personal reasons, moved to Mysore and hence <br />  Mysore !! We have discussed this.. Venkat wants this to be <br />  recalled ... !~!)</p>
<p>  When corroborated, ASI shocked us stating this could be close to <br />  200000 inscriptions collected all over Southern India ( Say Vizag / <br />  Mumbai - West Coast - Southern tip - East coast).</p>
<p>  Former CM quietly organised publishing of about 20000 inscriptions <br />  turing the tenure of State Archlgy Director TS Sridhar.. This <br />  excercise is being continued..</p>
<p>  State Archeology was formed when Dr. MGR learnt of the ASI / Mysore <br />  details and Dr. Nagaswamy (now writes in Tamil Arts Academy) was <br />its <br />  first Director (in about 1977 or so )- who published State <br />Archelogy <br />  series - District / Taluk wise In Thanjai Dt :: Thiruthuraipoondi - <br />  Thiruvalanchuzhi - Papanasam etc., for Thanjai, Darmapuri Dt, <br />  Pudukkottai, Kanyakumari etc., etc.    </p>
<p>  Under Special sanction from MGR Xerox machines capable of taking <br />  full scale xerox of 4' x 6' sheets were IMPORTED about 30 years <br />back <br />  for State Archeology !! When Maaligaimedu - near GKC escavations <br />  completed - publicity was made village wise using mike set and <br />  bullock cart - for conducting a week long Show in GKC by Dr. <br />  Nagaswamy. He organised Chidambaram Natyanjali (commencing today <br />  this year - being Sivarathri) - Rajaraja Dance Drama / Sound and <br />  Light shows in Thanjai / Madurai Nayakar Mahal etc.</p>
<p>  Such support continued for subsequent Directors like Nadana <br />  Kasinathan during Dr. Kalignar's chiefministership also. </p>
<p>  Thus, the unpublished inscriptions in Tamilnadu (present) alone <br />  should work to about 50000 only. Privately Tamil University / Indo <br />  French - Dr. Subbarayalu's Tholliyal Kazhagam publishes AVANAM, Dr. <br />  Kalaikovan / Dr. Nalini's Dr Rasamanickanar History Research Centre <br />  bring out VARALARU related to unpublished inscriptions.<br />  ================<br />    are there any more temples which have inscriptions that are to <br />be <br />    deciphered.</p>
<p>  A couple of days back HR&amp;CE informed that there are about 39000 <br />  temples in Tamilnadu. But we know of 274 (Siva) + say 106 <br />  (Vinnagars) + equal number of Grama temples, not exceeding 1000 <br />  containig valuable inscriptional data.</p>
<p>  Going by the rough date of 850 - 1250 AD - Cholas, another 100 <br />years <br />  Pandyas, another 100 years Moghuls, followed by Vijayanagaras,  <br />  temples built prior to the British in 1600 AD, containing <br />  inscriptions should not exceed 2000 maximum. </p>
<p>  We should short list these and check for Published and unpublished <br />  ones. </p>
<p>  Venkatesh.. should be possible.. we can definitely work in this <br />  direction.<br />  =========================<br />    without the copper plates was writing the chola history to this <br />  level <br />    atleast possible?</p>
<p>  TWO Copper plates : Thiruvalangadu Copper plate and Anamangalam <br />  (Near Nagai, where the village was granted to Buddha Vihar by RRC <br />  and further grants recorded by Rajendra I) Copper plates (which <br />  later found asylum in Holland's Leyden Museum - became to be known <br />  as Leyden Grants)discuss the Chola hierarchy in detail.</p>
<p>  These details are ALSO found in VEERARAJENDRA's KANYAKUMARI ( <br />  Suseendram? temple) inscriptions..</p>
<p>  The Chola History we read today is based on these THREE PRIMARY <br />  SOURCES only.</p>

<p>      Dear SPS and Natarajan,</p>
<p>      Perfect reply.</p>
<p>        1. Whether Temples give History ?</p>
<p>      Inscriptions related to donations cannot be neglected just like <br />    that. <br />      Any person who carefully analyses will find them as a source of <br />      treasure. Just a small example. The article <br />      <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=651" title="http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=651">http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=651</a> states what <br />  all <br />      informations can be filtered from the 'so called' donation <br />  related <br />      inscriptions.</p>
<p>      1. Revenue divisions<br />      2. Administrative divisions<br />      3. Taxes<br />      4. Agriculture and irrigation<br />      5. Land sales<br />      6. Land donations<br />      7. Mutts<br />      8. Lamps and worships<br />      9. Housing<br />      10. Dedication and worship with blood<br />      11. Temple management<br />      12. Village construction<br />      13. History of the temple</p>
<p>        2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder :</p>
<p>        Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders <br />  have <br />        constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including <br />  the <br />      one <br />        indicated here.</p>
<p>        Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive .. <br />        Involvement </p>
<p>      Mazhuppa vEndiya avasiyamE illai sir. You can very well say a <br />  BIG <br />    NO <br />      as the fact supports your point. Installing king's sculpture or <br />  his <br />      palace in stone are easier ways to show his EGO than such <br />  massive <br />      experiments. These things clearly shows that our kings were <br />  NEITHER <br />      egoists NOR egotists.</p>
<p>      Kamal says 'Renovating a temple without affecting inscriptions <br />  and <br />      architecture is very much possible. The best example is <br />      Thiruvalanjuzhi. SPS is the eye-witness and can furnish more <br />      details'. Please enlighten us.</p>

<p>            If temples are meant for worship, four walls and a roof <br />is <br />        enough. <br />          Why <br />            multi-storeys and beautiful sculptures? Can we take out <br />  upper <br />        floor <br />            stones for building forts and dams? Single floor will be <br />          comparatively <br />            safer for devotees than multiple floors. Isn't it? ;-)</p>
<p>          Hi<br />          exactly<br />          there comes the ego of the builder.<br />          20 feet lingams and 216 feet vimanams, and naming the <br />temple <br />      after <br />          himself.<br />          know who I am talking about.<br />          venketesh<br />        ==============================<br />        Let us consider the matters on hand :</p>
<p>        1. Whether Temples give History ?</p>
<p>        The inscriptions talk most of the grants made to the <br />  temple. <br />    SI <br />        inscriptions, Epigraphia Indica, State volumes, Avanam, <br />  Valarau, <br />        Temple, The Cholas, Pallavar Varalaru etc., are written based <br />  on <br />        these data only. Copper plates are also furnish similar data.</p>
<p>        Alternative is Literature.. which are considered to <br />  contain <br />      more <br />        flattery.</p>
<p>        Therefore, in the absense of recording of data in Temple, we <br />  will <br />      be <br />        left with only Literature.</p>
<p>        2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder :</p>
<p>        Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders <br />  have <br />        constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including <br />  the <br />      one <br />        indicated here.</p>
<p>        Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive ..  <br />        Involvement .. Or if EGO is interpreted as fitting the <br />  gradeure <br />    of <br />        the Builder with the combination of Motive and Involvement, <br />  then <br />      may <br />        be EGO is not the wrong selection.</p>
<p>        Then how are we going to explain the Monolithics in Srilanka <br />    (which <br />        Kalki describes) and our Sravanabelaguda in neighbourhood <br />  state?</p>
<p>        3. Single story / Multi-storied structure ::</p>
<p>        A detailed study on Ancient Temples would provide us data <br />  that :</p>
<p>        i) Apart from being place of worship, they were cultural <br />      centres;         ii) Provided employment to several<br />        iii) inscriptions show that they served as Registrar office<br />        iv) place of safeguarding food-produces<br />        v) Sheltering the needy during calamities<br />        vi) Served as Banks during Famine / Flood<br />        vii) Presence of Government establishment (as MANDRAMs <br />  were <br />        held under the shade of Trees only )- linked the Village / <br />    Panchyat <br />        with the Central Establishment at the Throne level.<br />        viii) Entertainment<br />        ix) Associated with Educational Establishments </p>
<p>        4. Place of worship is hardly multi-storied - except in <br />  certain <br />        Vinnagarams .. Nindran - irundhan - Kidanthan type (like <br />        Thiruveezhimizhalai, Thirukottiyur, Uthiramerur Sundraraja <br />    Perumal <br />        etc.).. Re Big Temple, pls read concept of the temple in the <br />        archieves.</p>
<p>        Now the Vimanams on the top of main deity served are not that <br />    tall <br />        and are defined for devine purpose. The Gopurams at the <br />  Entrance <br />        also served as Check post - overseeing any invasion / <br />  intrusion.</p>
<p>        This morning in JAYA TV a programme related to Siva-ottam <br />  (Siva <br />      run) <br />        covering about 12 temples around Kanyakumari wherein Siva - <br />      Narayana <br />        are the presiding deities and the devotees (more than 100 in <br />        numbers) commence the run for 100 Kms distance chanting Siva <br />&amp; <br />        Narayana on the previous day of Sivarathri day/nite and <br />  conclude <br />        Sivarathri night!</p>
<p>        Thanks for the opportunity to bring out this harmony.</p>

        <p>Dear Venkatesh,</p>
<p>New members are likely to get misguided by this exchange.</p>
<p>To clarify :</p>
<p>VENKATESH is NONE OTHER than (Anusha) Venkatesh, who has scribed and <br />published the Sequel to Ponniyinselvan in the form of KAVIRI <br />MAINDHAN ... Hailing from / associated with the families of <br />Heriditary Trustees of temples like Chidambaram, Thirubengadu, <br />Kalayarkoil, Rameswaram etc.</p>
<p>The question is put forth to summarise the discussions we have had <br />in the past in our Group.</p>
<p>LET ME MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER ::</p>
<p>--- In <a href="mailto:ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com">ponniyinselvan@yahoogroups.com</a>, "R.venketesh" <br /><abhivencat@...  wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>  Hi SPS</p>
<p>  just a few questions<br /> ============================</p></blockquote>
<p>what percentage of inscriptions on temples have been copied on to <br />paper in the major temples.</p>
<p>According to ASI Sources, out of about 110000 copied / estempaged <br />pages are lying unpublished in Mysore for the past 50 years !</p>
<p>(Why Mysore ? That ASI official was stationed at OOTY and when shut <br />down in 1960s for his personal reasons, moved to Mysore and hence <br />Mysore !! We have discussed this.. Venkat wants this to be <br />recalled ... !~!)</p>
<p>When corroborated, ASI shocked us stating this could be close to <br />200000 inscriptions collected all over Southern India ( Say Vizag / <br />Mumbai - West Coast - Southern tip - East coast).</p>
<p>Former CM quietly organised publishing of about 20000 inscriptions <br />turing the tenure of State Archlgy Director TS Sridhar.. This <br />excercise is being continued..</p>
<p>State Archeology was formed when Dr. MGR learnt of the ASI / Mysore <br />details and Dr. Nagaswamy (now writes in Tamil Arts Academy) was its <br />first Director (in about 1977 or so )- who published State Archelogy <br />series - District / Taluk wise In Thanjai Dt :: Thiruthuraipoondi - <br />Thiruvalanchuzhi - Papanasam etc., for Thanjai, Darmapuri Dt, <br />Pudukkottai, Kanyakumari etc., etc.    </p>
<p>Under Special sanction from MGR Xerox machines capable of taking <br />full scale xerox of 4' x 6' sheets were IMPORTED about 30 years back <br />for State Archeology !! When Maaligaimedu - near GKC escavations <br />completed - publicity was made village wise using mike set and <br />bullock cart - for conducting a week long Show in GKC by Dr. <br />Nagaswamy. He organised Chidambaram Natyanjali (commencing today <br />this year - being Sivarathri) - Rajaraja Dance Drama / Sound and <br />Light shows in Thanjai / Madurai Nayakar Mahal etc.</p>
<p>Such support continued for subsequent Directors like Nadana <br />Kasinathan during Dr. Kalignar's chiefministership also. </p>
<p>Thus, the unpublished inscriptions in Tamilnadu (present) alone <br />should work to about 50000 only. Privately Tamil University / Indo <br />French - Dr. Subbarayalu's Tholliyal Kazhagam publishes AVANAM, Dr. <br />Kalaikovan / Dr. Nalini's Dr Rasamanickanar History Research Centre <br />bring out VARALARU related to unpublished inscriptions.<br />================</p>
<blockquote><p>  are there any more temples which have inscriptions that are to be <br />  deciphered.</p></blockquote>
<p>A couple of days back HR&amp;CE informed that there are about 39000 <br />temples in Tamilnadu. But we know of 274 (Siva) + say 106 <br />(Vinnagars) + equal number of Grama temples, not exceeding 1000 <br />containig valuable inscriptional data.</p>
<p>Going by the rough date of 850 - 1250 AD - Cholas, another 100 years <br />Pandyas, another 100 years Moghuls, followed by Vijayanagaras,  <br />temples built prior to the British in 1600 AD, containing <br />inscriptions should not exceed 2000 maximum. </p>
<p>We should short list these and check for Published and unpublished <br />ones. </p>
<p>Venkatesh.. should be possible.. we can definitely work in this <br />direction.<br />=========================</p>
<blockquote><p>  without the copper plates was writing the chola history to this <br />level <br />  atleast possible?</p></blockquote>
<p>TWO Copper plates : Thiruvalangadu Copper plate and Anamangalam <br />(Near Nagai, where the village was granted to Buddha Vihar by RRC <br />and further grants recorded by Rajendra I) Copper plates (which <br />later found asylum in Holland's Leyden Museum - became to be known <br />as Leyden Grants)discuss the Chola hierarchy in detail.</p>
<p>These details are ALSO found in VEERARAJENDRA's KANYAKUMARI ( <br />Suseendram? temple) inscriptions..</p>
<p>The Chola History we read today is based on these THREE PRIMARY <br />SOURCES only.</p>

<p>    Dear SPS and Natarajan,</p>
<p>    Perfect reply.</p>
<p>      1. Whether Temples give History ?</p>
<p>    Inscriptions related to donations cannot be neglected just like <br />  that. <br />    Any person who carefully analyses will find them as a source of <br />    treasure. Just a small example. The article <br />    <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=651" title="http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=651">http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=651</a> states what <br />all <br />    informations can be filtered from the 'so called' donation <br />related <br />    inscriptions.</p>
<p>    1. Revenue divisions<br />    2. Administrative divisions<br />    3. Taxes<br />    4. Agriculture and irrigation<br />    5. Land sales<br />    6. Land donations<br />    7. Mutts<br />    8. Lamps and worships<br />    9. Housing<br />    10. Dedication and worship with blood<br />    11. Temple management<br />    12. Village construction<br />    13. History of the temple</p>
<p>      2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder :</p>
<p>      Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders <br />have <br />      constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including <br />the <br />    one <br />      indicated here.</p>
<p>      Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive .. <br />      Involvement </p>
<p>    Mazhuppa vEndiya avasiyamE illai sir. You can very well say a <br />BIG <br />  NO <br />    as the fact supports your point. Installing king's sculpture or <br />his <br />    palace in stone are easier ways to show his EGO than such <br />massive <br />    experiments. These things clearly shows that our kings were <br />NEITHER <br />    egoists NOR egotists.</p>
<p>    Kamal says 'Renovating a temple without affecting inscriptions <br />and <br />    architecture is very much possible. The best example is <br />    Thiruvalanjuzhi. SPS is the eye-witness and can furnish more <br />    details'. Please enlighten us.</p>

<p>          If temples are meant for worship, four walls and a roof is <br />      enough. <br />        Why <br />          multi-storeys and beautiful sculptures? Can we take out <br />upper <br />      floor <br />          stones for building forts and dams? Single floor will be <br />        comparatively <br />          safer for devotees than multiple floors. Isn't it? ;-)</p>
<p>        Hi<br />        exactly<br />        there comes the ego of the builder.<br />        20 feet lingams and 216 feet vimanams, and naming the temple <br />    after <br />        himself.<br />        know who I am talking about.<br />        venketesh<br />      ==============================<br />      Let us consider the matters on hand :</p>
<p>      1. Whether Temples give History ?</p>
<p>      The inscriptions talk most of the grants made to the <br />temple. <br />  SI <br />      inscriptions, Epigraphia Indica, State volumes, Avanam, <br />Valarau, <br />      Temple, The Cholas, Pallavar Varalaru etc., are written based <br />on <br />      these data only. Copper plates are also furnish similar data.</p>
<p>      Alternative is Literature.. which are considered to <br />contain <br />    more <br />      flattery.</p>
<p>      Therefore, in the absense of recording of data in Temple, we <br />will <br />    be <br />      left with only Literature.</p>
<p>      2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder :</p>
<p>      Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders <br />have <br />      constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including <br />the <br />    one <br />      indicated here.</p>
<p>      Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive ..  <br />      Involvement .. Or if EGO is interpreted as fitting the <br />gradeure <br />  of <br />      the Builder with the combination of Motive and Involvement, <br />then <br />    may <br />      be EGO is not the wrong selection.</p>
<p>      Then how are we going to explain the Monolithics in Srilanka <br />  (which <br />      Kalki describes) and our Sravanabelaguda in neighbourhood <br />state?</p>
<p>      3. Single story / Multi-storied structure ::</p>
<p>      A detailed study on Ancient Temples would provide us data <br />that :</p>
<p>      i) Apart from being place of worship, they were cultural <br />    centres;       ii) Provided employment to several<br />      iii) inscriptions show that they served as Registrar office<br />      iv) place of safeguarding food-produces<br />      v) Sheltering the needy during calamities<br />      vi) Served as Banks during Famine / Flood<br />      vii) Presence of Government establishment (as MANDRAMs <br />were <br />      held under the shade of Trees only )- linked the Village / <br />  Panchyat <br />      with the Central Establishment at the Throne level.<br />      viii) Entertainment<br />      ix) Associated with Educational Establishments </p>
<p>      4. Place of worship is hardly multi-storied - except in <br />certain <br />      Vinnagarams .. Nindran - irundhan - Kidanthan type (like <br />      Thiruveezhimizhalai, Thirukottiyur, Uthiramerur Sundraraja <br />  Perumal <br />      etc.).. Re Big Temple, pls read concept of the temple in the <br />      archieves.</p>
<p>      Now the Vimanams on the top of main deity served are not that <br />  tall <br />      and are defined for devine purpose. The Gopurams at the <br />Entrance <br />      also served as Check post - overseeing any invasion / <br />intrusion.</p>
<p>      This morning in JAYA TV a programme related to Siva-ottam <br />(Siva <br />    run) <br />      covering about 12 temples around Kanyakumari wherein Siva - <br />    Narayana <br />      are the presiding deities and the devotees (more than 100 in <br />      numbers) commence the run for 100 Kms distance chanting Siva &amp; <br />      Narayana on the previous day of Sivarathri day/nite and <br />conclude <br />      Sivarathri night!</p>
<p>      Thanks for the opportunity to bring out this harmony.</p>
<p>      regards / </p>

<p>thanks sps, the last line is the most important...Atyantakama <br />Pallavesvara.....we know that many pallava kings took this title but <br />rajasimhan took it most - the king of unlimited fantasies....and the <br />saluvankuppam shrine carries that name and also that of his clan - <br />so king sharing title with the lord of the shrine he builds is <br />prevalent from then on</p>

<p>  check out these inscriptions of rajasimhan.....we can also study <br />  mahendra's works and mamalla ...most of their works play or <br />atleast <br />  pun on their godly status. they were atmost bordering on this or <br />  even hinting at the close resemblance etc. we see similar strains <br />in <br />  the meikeerthi - asigning godly charm to the king. among the <br />  hundreds of fanciful titles the pallavas,cholas,pandyas took the <br />two <br />  most fascinating ones are of RRc and RJc</p>

<p>  Hi<br />  solar energy can be concentrated to cause steam. in fact there are or<br />  were huge plants operating in california.<br />  the other type of solar power the photovoltaics is used for smaller<br />  operations.<br />  solar thermal is the corre ct term for creating steam by<br />  concentrating sunlight using reflectors most of which are parabolic<br />  troughs.<br />  for Concentrating sunlight: Some device, usually a mirror, is used to<br />  concentrate light and heat from the sun into a small area, making the<br />  energy more concentrated and therefore more potent.<br />  the shpae of the mirror is most important. it more often than not<br />  resemples the parabola the invrted form of which is our temple shpes.<br />  venketesh</p>
<p>    Dear Sir,</p>
<p>    "to concentrate solar energy in thermal power generation."</p>
<p>    please note, thermal power is the power generated using<br />  coal...solar energy<br />    / solar power itself correct..</p>
<p>    " We have been avoiding mentioning CHIDAMBARAM .. "</p>
<p>    If I am correct in chidambarm only we have something like leaves /<br />  sethilgal<br />    on ponnambalam vimanam the total numbers (21600) of which means the<br />    breathing...like that so many specials are there but when I was<br />  reading that<br />    news about the fight for thevaram its very painfull..around 3000<br />  kms away<br />    people here in UAE worry much because there is no temple like in<br />  India, but<br />    where it is available people doesnt give due respect and ignore the<br />    importance!!!</p>

<p>        Hi<br />        in most religions the building of the temple roof is an inverted<br />        parabola.<br />        what we use for sattelite dishes and solar cookers is similar.</p>

<p>                If temples are meant for worship, four walls and a roof<br />  is<br />            enough.<br />              Why<br />                multi-storeys and beautiful sculptures? Can we take out<br />      upper<br />            floor<br />                stones for building forts and dams? Single floor will be<br />              comparatively<br />                safer for devotees than multiple floors. Isn't it? ;-)</p>
<p>              Hi<br />              exactly<br />              there comes the ego of the builder.<br />              20 feet lingams and 216 feet vimanams, and naming the<br />  temple<br />        after<br />              himself.<br />              know who I am talking about.<br />              venketesh<br />            ==============================<br />            Let us consider the matters on hand :</p>
<p>            1. Whether Temples give History ?</p>
<p>            The inscriptions talk most of the grants made to the<br />  temple. SI<br />            inscriptions, Epigraphia Indica, State volumes, Avanam,<br />      Valarau,<br />            Temple, The Cholas, Pallavar Varalaru etc., are written<br />  based<br />      on<br />            these data only. Copper plates are also furnish similar<br />  data.</p>
<p>            Alternative is Literature.. which are considered to contain<br />      more<br />            flattery.</p>
<p>            Therefore, in the absense of recording of data in Temple, we<br />      will<br />        be<br />            left with only Literature.</p>
<p>            2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder :</p>
<p>            Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders<br />      have<br />            constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including<br />      the<br />        one<br />            indicated here.</p>
<p>            Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive ..<br />            Involvement .. Or if EGO is interpreted as fitting the<br />      gradeure of<br />            the Builder with the combination of Motive and Involvement,<br />      then<br />        may<br />            be EGO is not the wrong selection.</p>
<p>            Then how are we going to explain the Monolithics in Srilanka<br />        (which<br />            Kalki describes) and our Sravanabelaguda in neighbourhood<br />      state?</p>
<p>            3. Single story / Multi-storied structure ::</p>
<p>            A detailed study on Ancient Temples would provide us data<br />      that :</p>
<p>            i) Apart from being place of worship, they were cultural<br />      centres;             ii) Provided employment to several<br />            iii) inscriptions show that they served as Registrar office<br />            iv) place of safeguarding food-produces<br />            v) Sheltering the needy during calamities<br />            vi) Served as Banks during Famine / Flood<br />            vii) Presence of Government establishment (as MANDRAMs were<br />            held under the shade of Trees only )- linked the Village /<br />        Panchyat<br />            with the Central Establishment at the Throne level.<br />            viii) Entertainment<br />            ix) Associated with Educational Establishments</p>
<p>            4. Place of worship is hardly multi-storied - except in<br />  certain<br />            Vinnagarams .. Nindran - irundhan - Kidanthan type (like<br />            Thiruveezhimizhalai, Thirukottiyur, Uthiramerur Sundraraja<br />      Perumal<br />            etc.).. Re Big Temple, pls read concept of the temple in the<br />            archieves.</p>
<p>            Now the Vimanams on the top of main deity served are not<br />  that<br />      tall<br />            and are defined for devine purpose. The Gopurams at the<br />      Entrance<br />            also served as Check post - overseeing any invasion /<br />      intrusion.</p>
<p>            This morning in JAYA TV a programme related to Siva-ottam<br />      (Siva<br />        run)<br />            covering about 12 temples around Kanyakumari wherein Siva -<br />        Narayana<br />            are the presiding deities and the devotees (more than 100 in<br />            numbers) commence the run for 100 Kms distance chanting<br />  Siva &amp;             Narayana on the previous day of Sivarathri day/nite and<br />      conclude<br />            Sivarathri night!</p>
<p>            Thanks for the opportunity to bring out this harmony.</p>

<p>But the people mentality and value system are not constant throughout <br />the 2000 years. What was thought impossible yesterday may become <br />possible today. Our kings cannot be fitted into today's definition of <br />ego. It is like questioning if a person killed hitler before WW2, is <br />he good or bad. Historical events should be analysed with the <br />background of those days. Not in today's context.</p>

<p>    check out these inscriptions of rajasimhan.....we can also study <br />    mahendra's works and mamalla ...most of their works play or <br />atleast <br />    pun on their godly status. they were atmost bordering on this or <br />    even hinting at the close resemblance etc. we see similar strains <br />  in <br />    the meikeerthi - asigning godly charm to the king. among the <br />    hundreds of fanciful titles the pallavas,cholas,pandyas took the <br />  two <br />    most fascinating ones are of RRc and RJc</p>

        <p>True vijay</p>
<p>many a king ruled with the backing of the populations feeling that <br />he was the shadow of god on earth.</p>
<p>the kings too perhaps started thinking that way till they got the <br />first whipping in battle.</p>
<p>i remmeber when russia under the czars used to invade the ottoman <br />empire, whatever the result of the battle the y used to claim victory <br />and celebrate. this was irritating the ottomans.<br />one time he russians got a whipping and the ottomans sent back a <br />procession of blinded prisoners of war. some ten thousand of them. <br />one in hundred had one eye blinded to lead the rest. they proved the <br />point.</p>

<p>  check out these inscriptions of rajasimhan.....we can also study <br />  mahendra's works and mamalla ...most of their works play or atleast <br />  pun on their godly status. they were atmost bordering on this or <br />  even hinting at the close resemblance etc. we see similar strains <br />in <br />  the meikeerthi - asigning godly charm to the king. among the <br />  hundreds of fanciful titles the pallavas,cholas,pandyas took the <br />two <br />  most fascinating ones are of RRc and RJc</p>

        <p>Hi SPS</p>
<p>just a few questions</p>
<p>what percentage of inscriptions on temples have been copied on to <br />paper in the major temples.</p>
<p>are there any more temples which have inscriptions that are to be <br />deciphered.</p>
<p>without the copper plates was writing the chola history to this level <br />atleast possible?</p>

<p>  Dear SPS and Natarajan,</p>
<p>  Perfect reply.</p>
<p>    1. Whether Temples give History ?</p>
<p>  Inscriptions related to donations cannot be neglected just like <br />that. <br />  Any person who carefully analyses will find them as a source of <br />  treasure. Just a small example. The article <br />  <a href="http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=651" title="http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=651">http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=651</a> states what all <br />  informations can be filtered from the 'so called' donation related <br />  inscriptions.</p>
<p>  1. Revenue divisions<br />  2. Administrative divisions<br />  3. Taxes<br />  4. Agriculture and irrigation<br />  5. Land sales<br />  6. Land donations<br />  7. Mutts<br />  8. Lamps and worships<br />  9. Housing<br />  10. Dedication and worship with blood<br />  11. Temple management<br />  12. Village construction<br />  13. History of the temple</p>
<p>    2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder :</p>
<p>    Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders have <br />    constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including the <br />  one <br />    indicated here.</p>
<p>    Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive .. <br />    Involvement </p>
<p>  Mazhuppa vEndiya avasiyamE illai sir. You can very well say a BIG <br />NO <br />  as the fact supports your point. Installing king's sculpture or his <br />  palace in stone are easier ways to show his EGO than such massive <br />  experiments. These things clearly shows that our kings were NEITHER <br />  egoists NOR egotists.</p>
<p>  Kamal says 'Renovating a temple without affecting inscriptions and <br />  architecture is very much possible. The best example is <br />  Thiruvalanjuzhi. SPS is the eye-witness and can furnish more <br />  details'. Please enlighten us.</p>

<p>        If temples are meant for worship, four walls and a roof is <br />    enough. <br />      Why <br />        multi-storeys and beautiful sculptures? Can we take out upper <br />    floor <br />        stones for building forts and dams? Single floor will be <br />      comparatively <br />        safer for devotees than multiple floors. Isn't it? ;-)</p>
<p>      Hi<br />      exactly<br />      there comes the ego of the builder.<br />      20 feet lingams and 216 feet vimanams, and naming the temple <br />  after <br />      himself.<br />      know who I am talking about.<br />      venketesh<br />    ==============================<br />    Let us consider the matters on hand :</p>
<p>    1. Whether Temples give History ?</p>
<p>    The inscriptions talk most of the grants made to the temple. <br />SI <br />    inscriptions, Epigraphia Indica, State volumes, Avanam, Valarau, <br />    Temple, The Cholas, Pallavar Varalaru etc., are written based on <br />    these data only. Copper plates are also furnish similar data.</p>
<p>    Alternative is Literature.. which are considered to contain <br />  more <br />    flattery.</p>
<p>    Therefore, in the absense of recording of data in Temple, we will <br />  be <br />    left with only Literature.</p>
<p>    2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder :</p>
<p>    Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders have <br />    constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including the <br />  one <br />    indicated here.</p>
<p>    Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive ..  <br />    Involvement .. Or if EGO is interpreted as fitting the gradeure <br />of <br />    the Builder with the combination of Motive and Involvement, then <br />  may <br />    be EGO is not the wrong selection.</p>
<p>    Then how are we going to explain the Monolithics in Srilanka <br />(which <br />    Kalki describes) and our Sravanabelaguda in neighbourhood state?</p>
<p>    3. Single story / Multi-storied structure ::</p>
<p>    A detailed study on Ancient Temples would provide us data that :</p>
<p>    i) Apart from being place of worship, they were cultural <br />  centres;     ii) Provided employment to several<br />    iii) inscriptions show that they served as Registrar office<br />    iv) place of safeguarding food-produces<br />    v) Sheltering the needy during calamities<br />    vi) Served as Banks during Famine / Flood<br />    vii) Presence of Government establishment (as MANDRAMs were <br />    held under the shade of Trees only )- linked the Village / <br />Panchyat <br />    with the Central Establishment at the Throne level.<br />    viii) Entertainment<br />    ix) Associated with Educational Establishments </p>
<p>    4. Place of worship is hardly multi-storied - except in certain <br />    Vinnagarams .. Nindran - irundhan - Kidanthan type (like <br />    Thiruveezhimizhalai, Thirukottiyur, Uthiramerur Sundraraja <br />Perumal <br />    etc.).. Re Big Temple, pls read concept of the temple in the <br />    archieves.</p>
<p>    Now the Vimanams on the top of main deity served are not that <br />tall <br />    and are defined for devine purpose. The Gopurams at the Entrance <br />    also served as Check post - overseeing any invasion / intrusion.</p>
<p>    This morning in JAYA TV a programme related to Siva-ottam (Siva <br />  run) <br />    covering about 12 temples around Kanyakumari wherein Siva - <br />  Narayana <br />    are the presiding deities and the devotees (more than 100 in <br />    numbers) commence the run for 100 Kms distance chanting Siva &amp; <br />    Narayana on the previous day of Sivarathri day/nite and conclude <br />    Sivarathri night!</p>
<p>    Thanks for the opportunity to bring out this harmony.</p>

        <p>interesting thread..missed out yesterday....while talking of <br />temples, lets look at the first structural hindu temples in south - <br />mallai...from what i have read of the pallavas - they were more akin <br />with the concept of god kings...devaraja concept - so much that it <br />spread from them into south east asia as well.</p>
<p>check out these inscriptions of rajasimhan.....we can also study <br />mahendra's works and mamalla ...most of their works play or atleast <br />pun on their godly status. they were atmost bordering on this or <br />even hinting at the close resemblance etc. we see similar strains in <br />the meikeerthi - asigning godly charm to the king. among the <br />hundreds of fanciful titles the pallavas,cholas,pandyas took the two <br />most fascinating ones are of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym  and <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym </p>
<p>siva pada sekaran ( <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym )<br />siva sarana sekaran ( <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan" RJC</acronym )</p>
<p>here they clearly distance from their devaraja cult into supreme <br />devotion to god. </p>

<p>Inscription on the Southern Wall of the Atiranacandesvara Temple <br />Saluvankuppam. </p>
<p>(Verses 1 and 2) Just as in a large lake filled with water which is <br />fit for bathing, and covered with various lotus flowers, handsome <br />Samkara (Siva) abides on the large head-sprinkled with the water of <br />coronation and covered with bright jewels====of the illustrious <br />Atyantakama, who deprives his enemies of their pride, who is a <br />receptacle of wealth, who possesses the charm of Cupid and who <br />assiduously worships Hara (Siva). <br />3. For the welfare of the earth, he who stands at the head of the <br />lords of the earth, caused to be made this house of Sambu (Siva), <br />which resembles Kailasa and Mandara. <br />4. May Sribhara be victorious for a long time, who bears Bhava <br />(Siva) in his mind which is filled with devotion, and bears the <br />earth on his arm like a coquettish embellishment! <br />5.Atiranacanda, the lord of the rulers of the earth, made this <br />(temple called) Atiranacandesvara. May Pasupati (Siva), attended by <br />the mountain-daughter (Parvati) and troop of Guhas, always take <br />delight (in residing here! <br />6. May the eight-formed lord of beings (Siva) for a long time take <br />up his abode in this temple called Atiranacandesvara which was <br />caused to be built by him, who together with the name of <br />Atiranacanda bears deep devotion to Isana (Siva), abundant <br />prosperity, the heavy burden of the earth and unequalled liberality, <br />and who is famed by the name of Ranajaya! <br />Anugrasila (the gentle-minded) <br />7. Who will be able to understand the music of Kalakala, if it were <br />not Vidhatri (Brahman) Bharata, Hari, Narada or Skanda? <br />Samaradhanamjaya (the conqueror of wealth in battle) Samgramadhira <br />(the firm in war.) </p>
<p>Inscription on the Northern Wall of the Atiranacandesvara Temple, <br />Saluvankuppam. </p>
<p>TRANSLATION <br />(Verse 1) May (Siva) the destroyer of Love, who is the cause of <br />production, existence and destruction (but is himself) without <br />cause, fulfil the boundless desires of men! <br />2. May he (Siva) be victorious, who is without illusion and <br />possessed of manifold illusion, who is without qualities and endowed <br />with qualities, who is existing by himself and is without superior, <br />who is without lord and the highest lord! <br />3. Srinidhi bears on his head the unborn (Siva), by the weight of <br />whose great toe Kailasa together with the ten faced (Ravana) sank <br />down into Patala. <br />4. May Sribhara be victorious for a long time, who bears Bhava <br />(Siva) in his mind which is filled with devotion, and bears the <br />earth on his arm like a conquettish embellishment! <br />5. King Atyantakama, who has subdued the territories of his foes, is <br />famed (by the name of) Ranajaya:====he caused to be made this house <br />of Sambhu (Siva) <br />6. May he be victorious, who is both sentient and motionless <br />(Sthanu), who is both undivided and the moon, who is both fire and <br />air, who is both terrible (Bhima) and kind (Siva), who is both the <br />cause of prosperity (Samkara and the destroyer of Love! <br />7. May Tarunankura be victorious, who is a king of kings, but is not <br />ugly (like Kuvera) who is am emperor, but does not distress people <br />(while Vishnu as both Chakrabhrit and Janardana) who is the lord of <br />protectors, but healthy (while the moon is the lord of stars, but is <br />subject to eclipses)! <br />(8 and 9) Just as in a large lake filled with water which is fit for <br />bathing, and covered with various lotus-flowers, handsome Samkara <br />(Siva) abides on the large head sprinkled with the water of <br />coronation and covered with bright jewels====of the illustrious <br />Atyanatakama who deprives his enemies of their pride, who is a <br />receptacle of wealth, who possesses the charm of Cupid, and who <br />assiduously worships Hara (Siva.) <br />10. He, desiring to attain the glory of Samkara (Siva), caused to be <br />made this lofty dwelling of Dhurjati (Siva) in order to procure the <br />fulfilment of their desires to his subjects. <br />11. Six times cursed be those, in whose hearts does not dwell Rudra <br />(Siva), the deliverer from the walking on the evil path! The temple <br />of Atyantakama Pallavesvara. </p></acronym></acronym></p>

<p>Dear SPS and Natarajan,</p>
<p>Perfect reply.</p>
<blockquote><p>  1. Whether Temples give History ?</p></blockquote>
<p>Inscriptions related to donations cannot be neglected just like that. <br />Any person who carefully analyses will find them as a source of <br />treasure. Just a small example. The article <br /><a href="http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=651" title="http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=651">http://www.varalaaru.com/Default.asp?articleid=651</a> states what all <br />informations can be filtered from the 'so called' donation related <br />inscriptions.</p>
<p>1. Revenue divisions<br />2. Administrative divisions<br />3. Taxes<br />4. Agriculture and irrigation<br />5. Land sales<br />6. Land donations<br />7. Mutts<br />8. Lamps and worships<br />9. Housing<br />10. Dedication and worship with blood<br />11. Temple management<br />12. Village construction<br />13. History of the temple</p>
<blockquote><p>  2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder :</p>
<p>  Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders have <br />  constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including the <br />one <br />  indicated here.</p>

<p>Mazhuppa vEndiya avasiyamE illai sir. You can very well say a BIG NO <br />as the fact supports your point. Installing king's sculpture or his <br />palace in stone are easier ways to show his EGO than such massive <br />experiments. These things clearly shows that our kings were NEITHER <br />egoists NOR egotists.</p>
<p>Kamal says 'Renovating a temple without affecting inscriptions and <br />architecture is very much possible. The best example is <br />Thiruvalanjuzhi. SPS is the eye-witness and can furnish more <br />details'. Please enlighten us.</p>

<p>      If temples are meant for worship, four walls and a roof is <br />  enough. <br />    Why <br />      multi-storeys and beautiful sculptures? Can we take out upper <br />  floor <br />      stones for building forts and dams? Single floor will be <br />    comparatively <br />      safer for devotees than multiple floors. Isn't it? ;-)</p>
<p>    Hi<br />    exactly<br />    there comes the ego of the builder.<br />    20 feet lingams and 216 feet vimanams, and naming the temple <br />after <br />    himself.<br />    know who I am talking about.<br />    venketesh<br />  ==============================<br />  Let us consider the matters on hand :</p>
<p>  1. Whether Temples give History ?</p>
<p>  The inscriptions talk most of the grants made to the temple. SI <br />  inscriptions, Epigraphia Indica, State volumes, Avanam, Valarau, <br />  Temple, The Cholas, Pallavar Varalaru etc., are written based on <br />  these data only. Copper plates are also furnish similar data.</p>
<p>  Alternative is Literature.. which are considered to contain <br />more <br />  flattery.</p>
<p>  Therefore, in the absense of recording of data in Temple, we will <br />be <br />  left with only Literature.</p>
<p>  2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder :</p>
<p>  Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders have <br />  constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including the <br />one <br />  indicated here.</p>
<p>  Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive ..  <br />  Involvement .. Or if EGO is interpreted as fitting the gradeure of <br />  the Builder with the combination of Motive and Involvement, then <br />may <br />  be EGO is not the wrong selection.</p>
<p>  Then how are we going to explain the Monolithics in Srilanka (which <br />  Kalki describes) and our Sravanabelaguda in neighbourhood state?</p>
<p>  3. Single story / Multi-storied structure ::</p>
<p>  A detailed study on Ancient Temples would provide us data that :</p>
<p>  i) Apart from being place of worship, they were cultural <br />centres;   ii) Provided employment to several<br />  iii) inscriptions show that they served as Registrar office<br />  iv) place of safeguarding food-produces<br />  v) Sheltering the needy during calamities<br />  vi) Served as Banks during Famine / Flood<br />  vii) Presence of Government establishment (as MANDRAMs were <br />  held under the shade of Trees only )- linked the Village / Panchyat <br />  with the Central Establishment at the Throne level.<br />  viii) Entertainment<br />  ix) Associated with Educational Establishments </p>
<p>  4. Place of worship is hardly multi-storied - except in certain <br />  Vinnagarams .. Nindran - irundhan - Kidanthan type (like <br />  Thiruveezhimizhalai, Thirukottiyur, Uthiramerur Sundraraja Perumal <br />  etc.).. Re Big Temple, pls read concept of the temple in the <br />  archieves.</p>
<p>  Now the Vimanams on the top of main deity served are not that tall <br />  and are defined for devine purpose. The Gopurams at the Entrance <br />  also served as Check post - overseeing any invasion / intrusion.</p>
<p>  This morning in JAYA TV a programme related to Siva-ottam (Siva <br />run) <br />  covering about 12 temples around Kanyakumari wherein Siva - <br />Narayana <br />  are the presiding deities and the devotees (more than 100 in <br />  numbers) commence the run for 100 Kms distance chanting Siva &amp; <br />  Narayana on the previous day of Sivarathri day/nite and conclude <br />  Sivarathri night!</p>
<p>  Thanks for the opportunity to bring out this harmony.</p>
<p>  regards / </p>

<p>          Then how are we going to explain the Monolithics in Srilanka<br />      (which<br />          Kalki describes) and our Sravanabelaguda in neighbourhood<br />    state?</p>
<p>          3. Single story / Multi-storied structure ::</p>
<p>          A detailed study on Ancient Temples would provide us data<br />    that :</p>
<p>          i) Apart from being place of worship, they were cultural<br />    centres;           ii) Provided employment to several<br />          iii) inscriptions show that they served as Registrar office<br />          iv) place of safeguarding food-produces<br />          v) Sheltering the needy during calamities<br />          vi) Served as Banks during Famine / Flood<br />          vii) Presence of Government establishment (as MANDRAMs were<br />          held under the shade of Trees only )- linked the Village /<br />      Panchyat<br />          with the Central Establishment at the Throne level.<br />          viii) Entertainment<br />          ix) Associated with Educational Establishments</p>
<p>          4. Place of worship is hardly multi-storied - except in <br />certain<br />          Vinnagarams .. Nindran - irundhan - Kidanthan type (like<br />          Thiruveezhimizhalai, Thirukottiyur, Uthiramerur Sundraraja<br />    Perumal<br />          etc.).. Re Big Temple, pls read concept of the temple in the<br />          archieves.</p>
<p>          Now the Vimanams on the top of main deity served are not <br />that<br />    tall<br />          and are defined for devine purpose. The Gopurams at the<br />    Entrance<br />          also served as Check post - overseeing any invasion /<br />    intrusion.</p>
<p>          This morning in JAYA TV a programme related to Siva-ottam<br />    (Siva<br />      run)<br />          covering about 12 temples around Kanyakumari wherein Siva -<br />      Narayana<br />          are the presiding deities and the devotees (more than 100 in<br />          numbers) commence the run for 100 Kms distance chanting <br />Siva &amp;           Narayana on the previous day of Sivarathri day/nite and<br />    conclude<br />          Sivarathri night!</p>

        <p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>"to concentrate solar energy in thermal power generation."</p>
<p>please note, thermal power is the power generated using coal...solar energy<br />/ solar power itself correct..</p>
<p>" We have been avoiding mentioning CHIDAMBARAM .. "</p>
<p>If I am correct in chidambarm only we have something like leaves / sethilgal<br />on ponnambalam vimanam the total numbers (21600) of which means the<br />breathing...like that so many specials are there but when I was reading that<br />news about the fight for thevaram its very painfull..around 3000 kms away<br />people here in UAE worry much because there is no temple like in India, but<br />where it is available people doesnt give due respect and ignore the<br />importance!!!</p>
<p>If padhanjali returns what would be his reaction for this incident??? god<br />only knows!!!?</p>

<p>    1. Whether Temples give History ?</p>
<p>    The inscriptions talk most of the grants made to the temple. SI<br />    inscriptions, Epigraphia Indica, State volumes, Avanam, Valarau,<br />    Temple, The Cholas, Pallavar Varalaru etc., are written based on<br />    these data only. Copper plates are also furnish similar data.</p>
<p>    Alternative is Literature.. which are considered to contain more<br />    flattery.</p>
<p>    Therefore, in the absense of recording of data in Temple, we will <br />be<br />    left with only Literature.</p>
<p>    2. Temples do indicate EGO of Builder :</p>
<p>    Instead of putting NO, I would consider NONE OF the Builders have<br />    constructed their PALACEs at par with the Temple - including the <br />one<br />    indicated here.</p>
<p>    Should we consider alternative diction to EGO :: Motive ..<br />    Involvement .. Or if EGO is interpreted as fitting the gradeure of<br />    the Builder with the combination of Motive and Involvement, then <br />may<br />    be EGO is not the wrong selection.</p>
<p>    Then how are we going to explain the Monolithics in Srilanka <br />(which<br />    Kalki describes) and our Sravanabelaguda in neighbourhood state?</p>
<p>    3. Single story / Multi-storied structure ::</p>
<p>    A detailed study on Ancient Temples would provide us data that :</p>
<p>    i) Apart from being place of worship, they were cultural centres;     ii) Provided employment to several<br />    iii) inscriptions show that they served as Registrar office<br />    iv) place of safeguarding food-produces<br />    v) Sheltering the needy during calamities<br />    vi) Served as Banks during Famine / Flood<br />    vii) Presence of Government establishment (as MANDRAMs were<br />    held under the shade of Trees only )- linked the Village / <br />Panchyat<br />    with the Central Establishment at the Throne level.<br />    viii) Entertainment<br />    ix) Associated with Educational Establishments</p>

        <p>Dear SPS sir,</p>
<p>Thanks for this important info about the temples. During my childhood days<br />when we were playing in temple we used to hear stories and some history<br />about temples,that time some elder people told us that the shape of the<br />vimanam and the gopuram helps to focus the eternal power inside the temples<br />which will induce some vibrations and act together with mind waves to give<br />peace of mind and so many other things.....could you just comprehend this<br />one??</p>
