<p>There was a say in African countries now a days. When Europian landed in Africa, the bible was with White and the land and wealth was with black. After some time it was reverse. </p>
<p>In India, as Venkatesh rightly said, our so called numerous rajaas have welcomed them with both their hands and allowed them to conquer their 'enemies' portion. It happened not only in Tamil speaking 'nations' but also other areas including Andhra and Bengal. Do any one know that there were twenty two independent kingdoms during 19th century in the so called vengi (present east and west godavari districts) and south Kalingas? Even to day the raajaas of Bobbili and Vizianagaram kings were enemies only. <br />(Vizianagaram and Bobiili distance is just 30 kms)There were so many situatuions that led to their darling queens to sacrifice their lives by falling into fire just for fear on atrocity on them by rival kings. I agree it has happened in Tamilnadu too but not like northern areas of Tamilnadu. </p>
<p>One way we can treat British as 'saviours' but at the same time we have to agree the dirty truth that we needed a centralised ruler like British. British played a Monkey role in distributing eatable to poor cats of local kings. Every individual king kept quiet during British rule and ofcourse happy too. Even in TN history we had prosperous during centralised rule of <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym /Kuloththungha but when chola empire weakened everything gone. Still we are praying at the temples of more than 800 years old only. </p>
<p>But Rahul arguement are little diverted, I feel. Even without the so called help of British we would have had all the modern facilities. We need not compare ourselves with African countries. There was a joke in London (May be Sri knows that) while riding a sardar's taxi, a proud British was castigating the Indian sardar that if no british in India there were no rajabhaattaas (highways), there were no trains like that. The Indian Sardar hit back with the words that everything was laid by British for selfish sake as they wanted a route to export things to British. The highways and trains led to harbours only and take every Indian thing to London (Tea, cotton, tobacco and minerals and ofcourse gold too)</p>
<p>Our Indians are peculiar in nature. They fight each other but when common enemy comes they join together. Recently we have all seen during Kargil war period. We will have to count British also to that extent. And Saint Arvindar who vehemently waged a war against British suddenly got the enlightenment and he shifted his knowledge towards spirituality. Perhaps, he might have told Barathi about the future independent India - perhaps Bharati who had the insight of that feeling and sang 'aaduvOmE paLLu paaduvOmE.. aanandha sudhanthiram adainthu...</p>

<p>Thanks for your mail. With all due respect to you both i beg to differ. I think India still would have been a vibrant economy even without the British. Maybe it would have taken a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym  more time but it would certainly have happened. There is always this attitude that without the British we wouldn't have had the railways,command over the English language,cricket,etc. We would still have done these things without the British and we would have remained united. The British made sure when they were leaving that this problem of religion and partition would haunt us for ever. </p>
<p>I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British did not rule India" as this is purely hypothetical. Do you think a culture which is as old as ours changed for the better just because of a minuscule period ruled by the British? Just because you are a superior nation it does not give you the right to rule over the weak let alone take their lives. My clients in England still treat this country as an English colony. </p>
<p>What happened to us by the British is similar to what is happening to Iraq by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has railways,proper government systems would they be happy that the US came and conquered them? No! This attitude is prevalent amongst us Indians,only! I remember reading in a thread before "Indians are the ONLY countrymen who are not proud about their past" </p>
<p>Remember what Nelson Mandela said "The problem is not that they think they are superior the problem we think we are inferior"</p>

<p>    but if you keep patriotism from shading your concience you will<br />    learn that none of these guys were anti british from the start. <br />both<br />    maruthu pandyar and kattabomman had paid their taxes to the nawab<br />    and the british regularly. some dispute in the middle caused <br />their<br />    tiff.</p>
<p>    remember . <br />    india as an entity is post gandhi. thank him for it.</p>
<p>    we were literally ruled by a pack of lusty thieves( sorry for the<br />    harsh language) each a tyrant in a postage size princely state <br />    before the british came. and they made the british seem better.</p>

<p>        not only the person but the period must have been fantastic<br />        ( in the retrospective)- not for guys living at that time </p>
<p>        a period when the line between a ruler and a robber was very<br />    thin. a<br />        period when lotsa of non royals became blue blooded ones.<br />        the poligar times is a fantastic political play ground in the <br />        history of tamilnadu.</p>
<p>        maruthu pandyar, umai thurai, kattaboman, thondaimans, the <br />french<br />        and the british battling it out in the land and the sea( <br />sadras<br />        kalpakkam is famous for its anglo french naval battles)<br />        regards<br />        venketesh</p>

He has <br />    been a<br />          Hindu,learnt his 3 R's in a christian household,had an <br />affair<br />    with<br />        a<br />          Frenchwoman,married a parangi, and converted to Islam.

The only way for letting the world <br />know<br />        about our<br />          heroes would be to write their memoirs in English and sell <br />them<br />        abroad<br />          through a renowned publisher.

<p>            heres some matter on yusuf khan from the net</p>
<p>            Tradition has many stories to tell of this remarkable <br />man,<br />    who is<br />            commonly known in Madura as Khansa, an abbrevlation for <br />Khan<br />        Sahib.<br />            He was born in the Rammnad country and was originally a <br />    Hindu of<br />        the<br />            Vellala Caste. He ran away from his home, took Service <br />under<br />    a<br />            European for three years in pondicherry, was dismissed, <br />    served<br />        under<br />            another European (who educated him), went to the Nawab's<br />    court,<br />        rose<br />            rapidly in the army, married a parangi woman and <br />eventually,<br />    as<br />        has<br />            been seen, became Commandant of all the Company's <br />sepoys. His<br />            executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the report <br />    (see<br />            below) from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 and<br />    entitled 'A<br />            view of the English interests in India'--which was<br />    republished in <br />            Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and <br />Madura 'his<br />    whole<br />            administration denoted vigour and effect. His justice was<br />            unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were <br />happily<br />            combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge <br />from<br />            punishment.' It concludes by saying that his example <br />shows<br />            that 'wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate or <br />        complexion.'</p>
<p>            Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />            The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to the <br />    country,<br />            renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very<br />    moderate<br />        sum<br />            of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of <br />1759 and<br />        began<br />            by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting <br />avenues<br />        through<br />            their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they <br />fled, or<br />            executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners. He<br />    went on<br />        to<br />            reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had <br />    sobered all<br />            the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He even<br />    had the<br />            audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without <br />the<br />        knowledge<br />            or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762, he<br />        offered to<br />            lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at seven <br />    lakhs<br />        per<br />            annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was <br />enraged at<br />        this,<br />            or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy his <br />        masters--<br />            he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and began <br />to<br />        collect<br />            troops.</p>
<p>            He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />            In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against him <br />and<br />    he<br />        was<br />            besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly all <br />    deserted<br />            him, but he held out until October 1764 with great <br />energy and<br />        skill,<br />            renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense-- <br />he is<br />        said<br />            to have 'entirely repaired' its east face and constantly<br />    employed<br />            3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief assault <br />    with a<br />            loss of 120 Europeans (including nine officers) killed <br />and<br />        wounded.<br />            At the end of that time little real progress against him <br />had<br />    been<br />            made, except that the place was now rigorously blockaded,<br />    but he<br />        was<br />            treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in <br />charge<br />    of<br />        the<br />            French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles<br />    Campbell, who<br />            commanded the English among the besiegers. He was <br />    ignominiously<br />            hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of <br />Madura,<br />    and<br />        his<br />            body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque was <br />    afterwards<br />            erected over the tomb. It is still in existence--to the <br />left<br />    of<br />        the<br />            read to Dindigul, a little beyond the toll-gate--and is <br />known<br />            as 'Khan Sahib's pallivasal.'</p>

Did you mean Marudhanayagam? There <br />is a<br />        mosque<br />              near<br />                  my<br />                    home in<br />                      Madurai where they say his head is buried. This <br />    area is<br />              called<br />                    Samattipuram.<br />                      This is a very volatile area for asking <br />questions<br />    on<br />              religion,<br />                    this is what<br />                      has prevented me from doing so. This <br />    Marudhanayagam was<br />            also<br />              a<br />                    convert and<br />                      they say the British could not kill him. Every <br />time<br />        they<br />              thought<br />                    they had<br />                      killed him he came back! That is why the next <br />time<br />    they<br />              killed<br />                  him<br />                    they<br />                      separated his head from the body and buried <br />them<br />            separately.<br />              I<br />                    dont know<br />                      where they buried his body. <br />                      Can anybody elaborate on this? I am really <br />keen to<br />    know<br />            more<br />                  about <br />                    this<br />                      person.</p>

        <p>Dear Venkatesh<br />Thats very true</p>
<p>a few interesting facts there were 50 million native Indians in americas before the <br />the westerner settled there same in australia nad yet their native live in reserves in small numbers....<br />but Indians overcame all the portuguese,dutch and british and still are a majority</p>
<p>Moreover one of the biggest features of Indial elite which impressed the british was their ability to adapt and trading quality and fighting abilities esp the Jats and Gurkhas</p>
<p>Hence The Indians entered ICS and were shipped worldwide as dubashis administraters and workers to africa,and west indies,,burma and malysia</p>
<p>we have gained immencely as well as lodt as well due to british rule</p>

<p>if the cholas conquer kadaram we are proud<br />if maamallan burnt vatapi to ashes we are delighted</p>
<p>if lanka was conquered by the tamils we are delighted</p>
<p>we rate all these achievements as the bravery of our kings</p>
<p>but when the british conquered india why do we deem it a wrong thing.</p>
<p>we have to be honest in that also.</p>
<p>if you take the warfield also pushing aside all passions,the british <br />were certainly well equipped than our kings and deserved to win.</p>
<p>when we blame our caste system on the britisher's divide and rule <br />policy, do we thank his educational system for our success in BPO, <br />software and scientific advancements .</p>
<p>people would immidietly say the british offered education in lieu of <br />conversion.</p>
<p>but no other imperialist nation did so much for its colony.<br />the incas and the aztecs were wiped out.<br />the africans reduced to slaves.<br />the british did not try the indian experiment in other colonies <br />either.</p>
<p>curse me all but if you ask me sathish ' the best thing that happened <br />to india was the british rule"<br />regards<br />venketesh</p>

          British Rule        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I didnt check my mails for just four days and voila...more than 100 <br />mails. It took me nearly 2 hours to walk through the entire topic.<br />Good discussions.</p>
<p>A very good mail from Vidhya, vanished in the floods of mails. No <br />one noticed this? I think I wrote about this long back...whatever <br />WRONGs we see in our system, let it be religion, education or <br />whatsoever...it was created by the westerners to divide and rule. <br />Though casteism or such things existed prior to British India, I <br />suppose it was not as it is today...it was blown out of proportion <br />by the westerners and now being used effectively by our politicians.</p>
<p>The mission is clear....break the backbone....and what is Indias <br />backbone...was it our education system, our culture, our socio-<br />economic status...NO...it was our religion...whatever Indians do, <br />its attributed to religion...and if you want to break this, you have <br />to shake the vedic system...and for this the Aryan Invasion theory <br />was created. Do you think an education system which invented '0', a <br />country which wrote about heliocentric solar system centuries before <br />the europeans discovered, a country which produced great <br />mathematical titles like Baskara,leelavati, etc etc..lacked anything <br />in Education? And if we belive that we lacked education, how come <br />engineering marvals like the big temple or the konark temple come <br />up? How come a lingam stand up in the <acronym title="All India Radio" AIR </acronym in Somnath temple? </p>
<p>As rightly said by Arun et al, eriyara kollila ethu nalla kollinu <br />patha...Britishers were better. Europeans primary aim was looting <br />and secondary aim is conversion. As rightly put by Dan Brown in <br />Angels and Demons, the idea of conversion is not to change the <br />system, keep the system intact and replace the god. Thats why <br />G.U.Pope Translated Tiruvasakam and Max Muller translated Vedas. <br />Only if they can learn our things and pose to be sholars, they can <br />criticise those things and find fault with it...which will pave easy <br />way for conversion.</p>
<p>I have heard that, every now and then old bibles will be taken back <br />and new bibles will be distributed to people..ie. Bible is subject <br />to revision every now and then, depeding on the current socio-<br />economic conditions...to show that their ancient scriptures still <br />hold good for the current conditions..I think this was also brought <br />out by Dan Brown.</p>
<p>To concur with Arun, when we brand Britishers as foreigners, why <br />didnt we react to the british invasion? Again the reason is <br />ignorance laid down by the 800 year of Islamic rule, which created a <br />fear in the minds of People. Our backbone was shattered by unheard <br />barbaric acts..and it was easily broken down by Britishers. Even <br />then we waited for Anne Besant and like minds to come and tell <br />us "hey idiots you need freedom. fight for it".</p>
<p>nallatho kettatho, we got used to the system that only if a white <br />skin tells us we will accept.</p>
<p>But all my vote goes to the Britishers for the wonderful Railway <br />network. I bet without them Indian Railways is not what we have <br />today.Even though it was built for thier selfishness to transport <br />goods out of India and bring in their things into India...it helps <br />us a lot today.<br />The only government system in India, as far as I am concerned, is <br />fool proof to the common public today..meaning not much of bribery <br />by common people to use the service...<br />(namma makkal than ellathilayum killadi ache..intha systathayum <br />odachitanga..these days its common to bribe and get tickets.You can <br />get ticket even a few hours before the train departs)</p>
<p>I think I have exceede my limits. let me stop here.</p>

<p>1. we should first ask ourselves. was it possible for this land <br />spread of india to be one nation but for british intervention?</p>
<p>the answer is no.<br />we are still breaking at the seams are we not. states wanting to <br />break away and so on.<br />before the british intervened tamilnadu was a muslim state, <br />karnataka was muslim state, andhra was a muslim state.</p>
<p>2. were the british a major factor of christian conversion.<br />no madam Uma. if the portugese were here you wouldnt have a single <br />temple around. they would have knocked off every stone of it.<br />three of our holiest shrines kapali temple mylapore, kedeshwaram <br />and koneeshwaram in lanka were razed to the ground by the portugese <br />because they were in places where their writ ran.<br />the british even spared kalayar koil( so near your home town) <br />inspite of it being used as a fort against them.<br />the british inspite of the horns rahul paints on them were gentlemen.<br />remember the trials of all congressmen, the INA trials, the dilution <br />of the penalties. I am sure the british had mentally decided to <br />leave by 1940 itself</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hi all,<br />Got a chance to go thru this.Felt like sharing with you people.</p>
<p>"""Origin of the Subversive Agenda In India:<br />It was February 1835, a time when the British were striving to take <br />control of the whole of India. Lord Macaulay, a historian and a <br />politician, made a historical speech in the British Parliament, <br />commonly referred to as 'The Minutes', which struck a blow at the <br />centuries old system of Indian education. His words were to this <br />effect:</p>
<p>"I have traveled across the length and breadth of India and I have not <br />seen one person who is a beggar, who is a thief. Such wealth I have <br />seen in this country, such high moral values, people of such calibre, <br />that I do not think we would ever conquer this country, unless we <br />break the very backbone of this nation, which is her spiritual and <br />cultural heritage, and, therefore, I propose that we replace her old <br />and ancient education system, her culture, for if the Indians think <br />that all that is foreign and English is good and greater than their <br />own, they will lose their self-esteem, their native self-culture and <br />they will become what we want them, a truly dominated nation."<br />(Source: The Awakening Ray, Vol. 4 No. 5, The Gnostic Centre) <br />Reproduced in Niti issue of April, 2002 at p. 10 - a periodic <br />publication of Bharat Vikas Parishad, Delhi.</p>
<p>The history behind this writing is as follows:<br />When Lord Macaulay was traveling with some troops, which was headed by <br />an Indian, the young Indian stopped in the middle, got off his horse <br />and touched the feet of an old man. When asked, why he did this, the <br />soldier said is is my guruji (teacher). This made him believe that the <br />culture that respects teacher (no matter what physical / economic <br />condition and that too after such a long time, will be difficult to <br />conquer, unless you remove the roots."""</p>

          British Rule        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Well said Rahul!</p>
<p>I want to add just one more point to this very interesting discussion.</p>
<p>The Britishers had the audacity to introduce an "Anti-nautch" movement <br />wherein, dancers and musicians were banned from performing in temples <br />and in public. They thought they are teaching us civilisation. They <br />equated "Devadasis" to prostitutes and saw to it that Poojas donot <br />happen in public! What arrogance!</p>
<p>Venkatesh, when we were in Thanjavur, remember seeing the long wall of <br />Kalvettu with the names of dancers! Does that not show how advanced we <br />were in civilisation. Art like dance is a complete art which comprises <br />of music, body movements, sentiments, literature, story-telling, <br />instruments, stage presentation skills, costume, jewellery, make-up <br />etc. etc. The fact that more than 100 expert dancers got the honour of <br />getting invited to Thanjavur to dance in the presence of Peruvudaiyar <br />itself shows how many more such dancers were there! It shows, how <br />advanced our people were! It shows how happy and prosperous they were, <br />so that they can afford to spend time, effort and money on art!</p>
<p>The anti-nautch movement made all these wonderful artists go into <br />hiding and they were reduced to utter poverty and many took up <br />prostitution as a means to survive! How sad! My hearts crys for those <br />artists who had to hide their art from barbarians!</p>
<p>Mr.Krishna Iyer and Mrs.Rukmini Devi Arundale went searching for <br />devadasis, who had become almost extinct by then, and learnt the art <br />in closed doors and slowly brought it to auditoriums! That is a long <br />story again.</p>
<p>I would never be able to excuse the Britishers - the looters - the <br />barbarians - all they did was to do something, which was primarily in <br />their own interest and also to propagate Christianity. I wonder <br />whether they did anything for the common man !</p>
<p>Our people, our culture, tradition, survived inspite of them is the <br />victory! Today we conduct Natyanjali in Chidambaram shows we are not <br />like Australians who had to live on the mercy of the Queen!</p>
<p>The period of 300 years under British was a cursed period for the <br />glorious history our nation had - remember the word "Bharata Varshe <br />Bharatha Kande" in our mantras - we did not have a political unit <br />called India till then - but the concept of a nation, people of a <br />country did exist!</p>

<p>  I doubt if anyone is suggesting that in all our long history, the British<br />  rule was the best. I certainly am not suggesting that.

We are hearing stories abt the freedom struggle from our<br />    immediate ancestors.We have living witnesses for those incidents.But<br />    in the Mughals case it's a history a bit older than this.<br />    What we know about the Mughals are not well documented.<br />    I go with the people who claim that British was responsible fot<br />    uniting India as one nation.<br />    With regards<br />    Vidhya.</p>

        <p>There is a post in my blog rahuldhinakaran.blogspot.com called "An Indian<br />Identity". It is about something similar. Hope Mr Venkatesh and co like it.<br />I will be posting something about his arguement soon.<br />Please dont pay too much attention to the other 3 posts they are irrelevant<br />to our group.</p>

<blockquote><p>  we have started quite a arguement havent we!!? As Mrs Swetha said all<br />  these arguements can only be relative as what has happened has happened. For<br />  all the specifics from Mr Venkatesh (both of them and one more from Pondy)<br />  it really does hurt when people say the British rule was more beneficial<br />  than the opposite. The reason it hurts more is that we are a 4000 year old<br />  culture and we are on the point of agreeing that a mere 200 year rule by an<br />  outsider turned us into a vibrant nation. I dont know about you guys but i<br />  really cant digest it.<br />  Mr Venkatesh explained very well abut Hyderabad being aligned with<br />  Pakistan and the likes. Maybe all this could have happened and maybe we<br />  would have been a better nation (you guys must agree that there could also<br />  have been a better India). We really would never know and hence the<br />  arguement continues.<br />  I still stick by my point that we would have been a vibrant nation with or<br />  without the stupid Queen.</p>

<p>    Hi All,</p>
<p>    This is Venkatesh from Pondicherry. I would like to add my views on this<br />    interesting subject.</p>
<p>    The technological development happened in the 19th 20th century was a<br />    world wide phenomenon which would have been there in India whether Brits<br />    were there or not.</p>
<p>    The best part of British Rule is consolidation of Indian Territory be it<br />    as a bunch of princely states. Thanks to the Iron Man who did the finishing<br />    Job.</p>
<p>    I would like to say, British Rule was more a Blessing in Disguise than<br />    anything else.</p>

          British Rule        </div>

        <p>Rahul,</p>
<p>I doubt if anyone is suggesting that in all our long history, the British<br />rule was the best. I certainly am not suggesting that. I was merely trying<br />to compare British vs Muslim rule and why our attitudes towards both these<br />outsiders are very different. I still believe that for the Hindus in India,<br />the British rule was a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

          British Rule        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>we have started quite a arguement havent we!!? As Mrs Swetha said all these<br />arguements can only be relative as what has happened has happened. For all<br />the specifics from Mr Venkatesh (both of them and one more from Pondy) it<br />really does hurt when people say the British rule was more beneficial than<br />the opposite. The reason it hurts more is that we are a 4000 year old<br />culture and we are on the point of agreeing that a mere 200 year rule by an<br />outsider turned us into a vibrant nation. I dont know about you guys but i<br />really cant digest it.<br />Mr Venkatesh explained very well abut Hyderabad being aligned with Pakistan<br />and the likes. Maybe all this could have happened and maybe we would have<br />been a better nation (you guys must agree that there could also have been a<br />better India). We really would never know and hence the arguement continues.<br />I still stick by my point that we would have been a vibrant nation with or<br />without the stupid Queen.</p>

          British Rule        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>vanakkam,</p>
<p>I am fresh from completing "Freedom at Midinight" jus yesterday! I <br />shld really thank Venket n Satish for talking abt this book earlier. <br />It is one of the best books I've ever read.....</p>
<p>Both my paternal n maternal grandfathers were freedom fighters. I <br />also cannot stand the sight of British at times. But, I think the <br />major effect of British Rule was the emergence of a single entity <br />called India!</p>
<p><acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RRC</acronym , Kulothunga Chozhan, Akbar all of them did provide Central rule, <br />but I never thought it had the salient features of a united nation!</acronym></p>
<p>Education... yes we got western education, but I wouldn't term it as <br />the biggest benefit. I think by the end of the II World War, Britian <br />had come to a position wherein it felt, it better leave India before <br />it becomes too late. People like Churchill - the old warhorse, were <br />the only ones against it, not even the king!</p>
<p>Whether the British rule has done more good or bad to us is a <br />question for which there is no absolute answer, it is always <br />relative!</p>
<p>swetha </p>

          British Rule        </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>The British did quite a number of good things to our society. Education was<br />really the jewel in that. We are still reaping the benefits of having the<br />largest English literate society outside the countries which have English as<br />their mother tongue. They were far better rulers than the Mughals,etc.<br />But the issue is that would India have been such a vibrant economy without<br />the British rule? I am saying we would still have been all these things with<br />or without the British.</p>

<p>      I disagree there Venketesh.. All said and done we were not <br />White<br />    and hence<br />      the Brits would not have wasted their resources making us<br />    as "developed" as<br />      australia or new zealand.

<p>          There was a say in African countries now a days. When<br />    Europian<br />        landed in Africa, the bible was with White and the land and<br />    wealth<br />        was with black. After some time it was reverse.</p>
<p>          In India, as Venkatesh rightly said, our so called <br />numerous<br />        rajaas have welcomed them with both their hands and allowed <br />them<br />    to<br />        conquer their 'enemies' portion. It happened not only in <br />Tamil<br />        speaking 'nations' but also other areas including Andhra and<br />    Bengal.<br />        Do any one know that there were twenty two independent <br />kingdoms<br />        during 19th century in the so called vengi (present east and <br />west<br />        godavari districts) and south Kalingas? Even to day the <br />raajaas<br />    of<br />        Bobbili and Vizianagaram kings were enemies only.<br />          (Vizianagaram and Bobiili distance is just 30 kms)There <br />were so<br />        many situatuions that led to their darling queens to <br />sacrifice<br />    their<br />        lives by falling into fire just for fear on atrocity on them <br />by<br />        rival kings. I agree it has happened in Tamilnadu too but not<br />    like<br />        northern areas of Tamilnadu.</p>
<p>          One way we can treat British as 'saviours' but at the <br />same<br />    time<br />        we have to agree the dirty truth that we needed a centralised<br />    ruler<br />        like British. British played a Monkey role in distributing<br />    eatable<br />        to poor cats of local kings. Every individual king kept quiet<br />    during<br />        British rule and ofcourse happy too. Even in TN history we <br />had<br />        prosperous during centralised rule of RRC/Kuloththungha but <br />when<br />        chola empire weakened everything gone. Still we are praying <br />at<br />    the<br />        temples of more than 800 years old only.</p>
<p>          But Rahul arguement are little diverted, I feel. Even <br />without<br />        the so called help of British we would have had all the <br />modern<br />        facilities. We need not compare ourselves with African <br />countries.<br />        There was a joke in London (May be Sri knows that) while <br />riding a<br />        sardar's taxi, a proud British was castigating the Indian <br />sardar<br />        that if no british in India there were no rajabhaattaas<br />    (highways),<br />        there were no trains like that. The Indian Sardar hit back <br />with<br />    the<br />        words that everything was laid by British for selfish sake as<br />    they<br />        wanted a route to export things to British. The highways and<br />    trains<br />        led to harbours only and take every Indian thing to London <br />(Tea,<br />        cotton, tobacco and minerals and ofcourse gold too)</p>
<p>          Our Indians are peculiar in nature. They fight each <br />other but<br />        when common enemy comes they join together. Recently we have <br />all<br />        seen during Kargil war period. We will have to count British<br />    also to<br />        that extent. And Saint Arvindar who vehemently waged a war<br />    against<br />        British suddenly got the enlightenment and he shifted his<br />    knowledge<br />        towards spirituality. Perhaps, he might have told Barathi <br />about<br />    the<br />        future independent India - perhaps Bharati who had the <br />insight of<br />        that feeling and sang 'aaduvOmE paLLu paaduvOmE.. aanandha<br />        sudhanthiram adainthu...</p>

With all due respect to you both i <br />beg<br />    to<br />        differ. I think India still would have been a vibrant economy<br />    even<br />        without the British. Maybe it would have taken a bit more <br />time<br />    but<br />        it would certainly have happened. There is always this <br />attitude<br />    that<br />        without the British we wouldn't have had the railways,command<br />    over<br />        the English language,cricket,etc. We would still have done <br />these<br />        things without the British and we would have remained <br />united. The<br />        British made sure when they were leaving that this problem of<br />        religion and partition would haunt us for ever.</rahul.dhinakaran@></p>
<p>          I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British <br />did<br />    not<br />        rule India" as this is purely hypothetical. Do you think a<br />    culture<br />        which is as old as ours changed for the better just because <br />of a<br />        minuscule period ruled by the British? Just because you are a<br />        superior nation it does not give you the right to rule over <br />the<br />    weak<br />        let alone take their lives. My clients in England still treat<br />    this<br />        country as an English colony.</p>
<p>          What happened to us by the British is similar to what is<br />        happening to Iraq by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has<br />        railways,proper government systems would they be happy that <br />the<br />    US<br />        came and conquered them? No! This attitude is prevalent <br />amongst<br />    us<br />        Indians,only! I remember reading in a thread before "Indians <br />are<br />    the<br />        ONLY countrymen who are not proud about their past"</p>
<p>          Remember what Nelson Mandela said "The problem is not <br />that<br />    they<br />        think they are superior the problem we think we are inferior"</p>

<p>          There was a say in African countries now a days.  When<br />  Europian<br />      landed in Africa, the bible was with White and the land and<br />  wealth<br />      was with black. After some time it was reverse.</p>
<p>          In India, as Venkatesh rightly said, our so called numerous<br />      rajaas have welcomed them with both their hands and allowed them<br />  to<br />      conquer their 'enemies' portion. It happened not only in Tamil<br />      speaking 'nations' but also other areas including Andhra and<br />  Bengal.<br />      Do any one know that there were twenty two independent kingdoms<br />      during 19th century in the so called vengi (present east and west<br />      godavari districts) and south Kalingas? Even to day the raajaas<br />  of<br />      Bobbili and Vizianagaram kings were enemies only.<br />        (Vizianagaram and Bobiili distance is just 30 kms)There were so<br />      many situatuions that led to their darling queens to sacrifice<br />  their<br />      lives by falling into fire just for fear on atrocity on them by<br />      rival kings. I agree it has happened in Tamilnadu too but not<br />  like<br />      northern areas of Tamilnadu.</p>
<p>          One way we can treat British as 'saviours' but at the same<br />  time<br />      we have to agree the dirty truth that we needed a centralised<br />  ruler<br />      like British. British played a Monkey role in distributing<br />  eatable<br />      to poor cats of local kings. Every individual king kept quiet<br />  during<br />      British rule and ofcourse happy too. Even in TN history we had<br />      prosperous during centralised rule of RRC/Kuloththungha but when<br />      chola empire weakened everything gone. Still we are praying at<br />  the<br />      temples of more than 800 years old only.</p>
<p>          But Rahul arguement are little diverted, I feel. Even without<br />      the so called help of British we would have had all the modern<br />      facilities. We need not compare ourselves with African countries.<br />      There was a joke in London (May be Sri knows that) while riding a<br />      sardar's taxi, a proud British was castigating the Indian sardar<br />      that if no british in India there were no rajabhaattaas<br />  (highways),<br />      there were no trains like that. The Indian Sardar hit back with<br />  the<br />      words that everything was laid by British for selfish sake as<br />  they<br />      wanted a route to export things to British. The highways and<br />  trains<br />      led to harbours only and take every Indian thing to London (Tea,<br />      cotton, tobacco and minerals and ofcourse gold too)</p>
<p>          Our Indians are peculiar in nature. They fight each other but<br />      when common enemy comes they join together. Recently we have all<br />      seen during Kargil war period. We will have to count British<br />  also to<br />      that extent. And Saint Arvindar who vehemently waged a war<br />  against<br />      British suddenly got the enlightenment and he shifted his<br />  knowledge<br />      towards spirituality. Perhaps, he might have told Barathi about<br />  the<br />      future independent India - perhaps Bharati who had the insight of<br />      that feeling and sang 'aaduvOmE paLLu paaduvOmE.. aanandha<br />      sudhanthiram adainthu...</p>

<p>          Thanks for your mail. With all due respect to you both i beg<br />  to<br />      differ. I think India still would have been a vibrant economy<br />  even<br />      without the British. Maybe it would have taken a bit more time<br />  but<br />      it would certainly have happened. There is always this attitude<br />  that<br />      without the British we wouldn't have had the railways,command<br />  over<br />      the English language,cricket,etc. We would still have done these<br />      things without the British and we would have remained united. The<br />      British made sure when they were leaving that this problem of<br />      religion and partition would haunt us for ever.</p>
<p>          I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British did<br />  not<br />      rule India" as this is purely  hypothetical. Do you think a<br />  culture<br />      which is as old as ours changed for the better just because of a<br />      minuscule period ruled by the British? Just because you are a<br />      superior nation it does not give you the right to rule over the<br />  weak<br />      let alone take their lives. My clients in England still treat<br />  this<br />      country as an English colony.</p>
<p>          What happened to us by the British is similar to what is<br />      happening to Iraq by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has<br />      railways,proper government systems would they be happy that the<br />  US<br />      came and conquered them? No! This attitude is prevalent amongst<br />  us<br />      Indians,only! I remember reading in a thread before "Indians are<br />  the<br />      ONLY countrymen who are not proud about their past"</p>
<p>          Remember what Nelson Mandela said "The problem is not that<br />  they<br />      think they are superior the problem we think we are inferior"</p>

<p>        we are still paying for the " indian rule" from 1800 till<br />  1947.and<br />        lets realise its a costly payment.<br />        but for the british we would be like africa. 600 poor states<br />        fighting each other.<br />        thats why films like mangal pandey seem so out of place today.</p>

Is<br />  this<br />        because<br />              Marudhunayagam was not documented that well?<br />              How many Tamils have fought the British before 1857? Can<br />  you<br />        please<br />              elaborate on this?</p>
<p>              Regards<br />              Rahul</p>

<p>                    heres some matter on yusuf khan from the net</p>
<p>                    Tradition has many stories to tell of this<br />  remarkable<br />        man,<br />            who is<br />                    commonly known in Madura as Khansa, an abbrevlation<br />      for<br />        Khan<br />                Sahib.<br />                    He was born in the Rammnad country and was<br />  originally<br />      a<br />            Hindu of<br />                the<br />                    Vellala Caste. He ran away from his home, took<br />  Service<br />        under<br />            a<br />                    European for three years in pondicherry, was<br />      dismissed,<br />            served<br />                under<br />                    another European (who educated him), went to the<br />      Nawab's<br />            court,<br />                rose<br />                    rapidly in the army, married a parangi woman and<br />        eventually,<br />            as<br />                has<br />                    been seen, became Commandant of all the Company's<br />        sepoys. His<br />                    executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the<br />      report<br />            (see<br />                    below) from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785<br />  and<br />            entitled 'A<br />                    view of the English interests in India'--which was<br />            republished in<br />                    Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and<br />        Madura 'his<br />            whole<br />                    administration denoted vigour and effect. His<br />  justice<br />      was<br />                    unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures<br />  were<br />        happily<br />                    combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no<br />  refuge<br />        from<br />                    punishment.' It concludes by saying that his<br />  example<br />        shows<br />                    that 'wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no<br />  climate<br />      or<br />                complexion.'</p>
<p>                    Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />                    The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to<br />      the<br />            country,<br />                    renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the<br />  very<br />            moderate<br />                sum<br />                    of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring<br />  of<br />        1759 and<br />                began<br />                    by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting<br />        avenues<br />                through<br />                    their woods, he shot them down without mercy as<br />  they<br />        fled, or<br />                    executed as malefactors any who were taken<br />  prisoners.<br />      He<br />            went on<br />                to<br />                    reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon<br />  had<br />            sobered all<br />                    the poligars and made himself extremely powerful.<br />  He<br />      even<br />            had the<br />                    audacity to make war on the king of Travancore<br />  without<br />        the<br />                knowledge<br />                    or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in<br />  1762,<br />      he<br />                offered to<br />                    lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at<br />      seven<br />            lakhs<br />                per<br />                    annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was<br />        enraged at<br />                this,<br />                    or whether he thought himself powerful enough to<br />  defy<br />      his<br />                masters--<br />                    he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and<br />      began<br />        to<br />                collect<br />                    troops.</p>
<p>                    He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />                    In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against<br />      him<br />        and<br />            he<br />                was<br />                    besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly<br />      all<br />            deserted<br />                    him, but he held out until October 1764 with great<br />        energy and<br />                skill,<br />                    renovating and strengthening the fort at great<br />  expense-<br />      -<br />        he is<br />                said<br />                    to have 'entirely repaired' its east face and<br />      constantly<br />            employed<br />                    3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief<br />      assault<br />            with a<br />                    loss of 120 Europeans (including nine officers)<br />  killed<br />        and<br />                wounded.<br />                    At the end of that time little real progress<br />  against<br />      him<br />        had<br />            been<br />                    made, except that the place was now rigorously<br />      blockaded,<br />            but he<br />                was<br />                    treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer<br />  in<br />        charge<br />            of<br />                the<br />                    French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles<br />            Campbell, who<br />                    commanded the English among the besiegers. He was<br />            ignominiously<br />                    hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west<br />  of<br />        Madura,<br />            and<br />                his<br />                    body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque<br />  was<br />            afterwards<br />                    erected over the tomb. It is still in existence--to<br />      the<br />        left<br />            of<br />                the<br />                    read to Dindigul, a little beyond the toll-gate--<br />  and<br />      is<br />        known<br />                    as 'Khan Sahib's pallivasal.'</p>

<p>      There was a say in African countries now a days. When <br />Europian<br />    landed in Africa, the bible was with White and the land and <br />wealth<br />    was with black. After some time it was reverse.</p>
<p>      In India, as Venkatesh rightly said, our so called numerous<br />    rajaas have welcomed them with both their hands and allowed them <br />to<br />    conquer their 'enemies' portion. It happened not only in Tamil<br />    speaking 'nations' but also other areas including Andhra and <br />Bengal.<br />    Do any one know that there were twenty two independent kingdoms<br />    during 19th century in the so called vengi (present east and west<br />    godavari districts) and south Kalingas? Even to day the raajaas <br />of<br />    Bobbili and Vizianagaram kings were enemies only.<br />      (Vizianagaram and Bobiili distance is just 30 kms)There were so<br />    many situatuions that led to their darling queens to sacrifice <br />their<br />    lives by falling into fire just for fear on atrocity on them by<br />    rival kings. I agree it has happened in Tamilnadu too but not <br />like<br />    northern areas of Tamilnadu.</p>
<p>      One way we can treat British as 'saviours' but at the same <br />time<br />    we have to agree the dirty truth that we needed a centralised <br />ruler<br />    like British. British played a Monkey role in distributing <br />eatable<br />    to poor cats of local kings. Every individual king kept quiet <br />during<br />    British rule and ofcourse happy too. Even in TN history we had<br />    prosperous during centralised rule of RRC/Kuloththungha but when<br />    chola empire weakened everything gone. Still we are praying at <br />the<br />    temples of more than 800 years old only.</p>
<p>      But Rahul arguement are little diverted, I feel. Even without<br />    the so called help of British we would have had all the modern<br />    facilities. We need not compare ourselves with African countries.<br />    There was a joke in London (May be Sri knows that) while riding a<br />    sardar's taxi, a proud British was castigating the Indian sardar<br />    that if no british in India there were no rajabhaattaas <br />(highways),<br />    there were no trains like that. The Indian Sardar hit back with <br />the<br />    words that everything was laid by British for selfish sake as <br />they<br />    wanted a route to export things to British. The highways and <br />trains<br />    led to harbours only and take every Indian thing to London (Tea,<br />    cotton, tobacco and minerals and ofcourse gold too)</p>
<p>      Our Indians are peculiar in nature. They fight each other but<br />    when common enemy comes they join together. Recently we have all<br />    seen during Kargil war period. We will have to count British <br />also to<br />    that extent. And Saint Arvindar who vehemently waged a war <br />against<br />    British suddenly got the enlightenment and he shifted his <br />knowledge<br />    towards spirituality. Perhaps, he might have told Barathi about <br />the<br />    future independent India - perhaps Bharati who had the insight of<br />    that feeling and sang 'aaduvOmE paLLu paaduvOmE.. aanandha<br />    sudhanthiram adainthu...</p>

I think India still would have been a vibrant economy <br />even<br />    without the British. Maybe it would have taken a bit more time <br />but<br />    it would certainly have happened. There is always this attitude <br />that<br />    without the British we wouldn't have had the railways,command <br />over<br />    the English language,cricket,etc. We would still have done these<br />    things without the British and we would have remained united. The<br />    British made sure when they were leaving that this problem of<br />    religion and partition would haunt us for ever.</rahul.dhinakaran@></p>
<p>      I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British did <br />not<br />    rule India" as this is purely hypothetical. Do you think a <br />culture<br />    which is as old as ours changed for the better just because of a<br />    minuscule period ruled by the British? Just because you are a<br />    superior nation it does not give you the right to rule over the <br />weak<br />    let alone take their lives. My clients in England still treat <br />this<br />    country as an English colony.</p>
<p>      What happened to us by the British is similar to what is<br />    happening to Iraq by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has<br />    railways,proper government systems would they be happy that the <br />US<br />    came and conquered them? No! This attitude is prevalent amongst <br />us<br />    Indians,only! I remember reading in a thread before "Indians are <br />the<br />    ONLY countrymen who are not proud about their past"</p>
<p>      Remember what Nelson Mandela said "The problem is not that <br />they<br />    think they are superior the problem we think we are inferior"</p>

<p>      we are still paying for the " indian rule" from 1800 till <br />1947.and<br />      lets realise its a costly payment.<br />      but for the british we would be like africa. 600 poor states<br />      fighting each other.<br />      thats why films like mangal pandey seem so out of place today.</p>

<p>                  Tradition has many stories to tell of this <br />remarkable<br />      man,<br />          who is<br />                  commonly known in Madura as Khansa, an abbrevlation<br />    for<br />      Khan<br />              Sahib.<br />                  He was born in the Rammnad country and was <br />originally<br />    a<br />          Hindu of<br />              the<br />                  Vellala Caste. He ran away from his home, took <br />Service<br />      under<br />          a<br />                  European for three years in pondicherry, was<br />    dismissed,<br />          served<br />              under<br />                  another European (who educated him), went to the<br />    Nawab's<br />          court,<br />              rose<br />                  rapidly in the army, married a parangi woman and<br />      eventually,<br />          as<br />              has<br />                  been seen, became Commandant of all the Company's<br />      sepoys. His<br />                  executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the<br />    report<br />          (see<br />                  below) from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 <br />and<br />          entitled 'A<br />                  view of the English interests in India'--which was<br />          republished in<br />                  Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and<br />      Madura 'his<br />          whole<br />                  administration denoted vigour and effect. His <br />justice<br />    was<br />                  unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures <br />were<br />      happily<br />                  combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no <br />refuge<br />      from<br />                  punishment.' It concludes by saying that his <br />example<br />      shows<br />                  that 'wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no <br />climate<br />    or<br />              complexion.'</p>
<p>                  Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />                  The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to<br />    the<br />          country,<br />                  renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the <br />very<br />          moderate<br />              sum<br />                  of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring <br />of<br />      1759 and<br />              began<br />                  by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting<br />      avenues<br />              through<br />                  their woods, he shot them down without mercy as <br />they<br />      fled, or<br />                  executed as malefactors any who were taken <br />prisoners.<br />    He<br />          went on<br />              to<br />                  reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon <br />had<br />          sobered all<br />                  the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. <br />He<br />    even<br />          had the<br />                  audacity to make war on the king of Travancore <br />without<br />      the<br />              knowledge<br />                  or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in <br />1762,<br />    he<br />              offered to<br />                  lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at<br />    seven<br />          lakhs<br />              per<br />                  annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was<br />      enraged at<br />              this,<br />                  or whether he thought himself powerful enough to <br />defy<br />    his<br />              masters--<br />                  he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and<br />    began<br />      to<br />              collect<br />                  troops.</p>
<p>                  He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />                  In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against<br />    him<br />      and<br />          he<br />              was<br />                  besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly<br />    all<br />          deserted<br />                  him, but he held out until October 1764 with great<br />      energy and<br />              skill,<br />                  renovating and strengthening the fort at great <br />expense-<br />    -<br />      he is<br />              said<br />                  to have 'entirely repaired' its east face and<br />    constantly<br />          employed<br />                  3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief<br />    assault<br />          with a<br />                  loss of 120 Europeans (including nine officers) <br />killed<br />      and<br />              wounded.<br />                  At the end of that time little real progress <br />against<br />    him<br />      had<br />          been<br />                  made, except that the place was now rigorously<br />    blockaded,<br />          but he<br />              was<br />                  treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer <br />in<br />      charge<br />          of<br />              the<br />                  French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles<br />          Campbell, who<br />                  commanded the English among the besiegers. He was<br />          ignominiously<br />                  hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west <br />of<br />      Madura,<br />          and<br />              his<br />                  body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque <br />was<br />          afterwards<br />                  erected over the tomb. It is still in existence--to<br />    the<br />      left<br />          of<br />              the<br />                  read to Dindigul, a little beyond the toll-gate--<br />and<br />    is<br />      known<br />                  as 'Khan Sahib's pallivasal.'</p>

        <p>I disagree there Venketesh.. All said and done we were not White and hence<br />the Brits would not have wasted their resources making us as "developed" as<br />australia or new zealand. I am glad we got the Brits out.. it is OUR country<br />and we ought to rule it. But let us be fair to them I say. If we can call a<br />murderous invader from Afghanistan as ours.. then heck even Robert Clive was<br />ours what?;)</p>

<p>      There was a say in African countries now a days.  When Europian<br />  landed in Africa, the bible was with White and the land and wealth<br />  was with black. After some time it was reverse.</p>
<p>      In India, as Venkatesh rightly said, our so called numerous<br />  rajaas have welcomed them with both their hands and allowed them to<br />  conquer their 'enemies' portion. It happened not only in Tamil<br />  speaking 'nations' but also other areas including Andhra and Bengal.<br />  Do any one know that there were twenty two independent kingdoms<br />  during 19th century in the so called vengi (present east and west<br />  godavari districts) and south Kalingas? Even to day the raajaas of<br />  Bobbili and Vizianagaram kings were enemies only.<br />    (Vizianagaram and Bobiili distance is just 30 kms)There were so<br />  many situatuions that led to their darling queens to sacrifice their<br />  lives by falling into fire just for fear on atrocity on them by<br />  rival kings. I agree it has happened in Tamilnadu too but not like<br />  northern areas of Tamilnadu.</p>
<p>      One way we can treat British as 'saviours' but at the same time<br />  we have to agree the dirty truth that we needed a centralised ruler<br />  like British. British played a Monkey role in distributing eatable<br />  to poor cats of local kings. Every individual king kept quiet during<br />  British rule and ofcourse happy too. Even in TN history we had<br />  prosperous during centralised rule of RRC/Kuloththungha but when<br />  chola empire weakened everything gone. Still we are praying at the<br />  temples of more than 800 years old only.</p>
<p>      But Rahul arguement are little diverted, I feel. Even without<br />  the so called help of British we would have had all the modern<br />  facilities. We need not compare ourselves with African countries.<br />  There was a joke in London (May be Sri knows that) while riding a<br />  sardar's taxi, a proud British was castigating the Indian sardar<br />  that if no british in India there were no rajabhaattaas (highways),<br />  there were no trains like that. The Indian Sardar hit back with the<br />  words that everything was laid by British for selfish sake as they<br />  wanted a route to export things to British. The highways and trains<br />  led to harbours only and take every Indian thing to London (Tea,<br />  cotton, tobacco and minerals and ofcourse gold too)</p>
<p>      Our Indians are peculiar in nature. They fight each other but<br />  when common enemy comes they join together. Recently we have all<br />  seen during Kargil war period. We will have to count British also to<br />  that extent. And Saint Arvindar who vehemently waged a war against<br />  British suddenly got the enlightenment and he shifted his knowledge<br />  towards spirituality. Perhaps, he might have told Barathi about the<br />  future independent India - perhaps Bharati who had the insight of<br />  that feeling and sang 'aaduvOmE paLLu paaduvOmE.. aanandha<br />  sudhanthiram adainthu...</p>

<p>      Thanks for your mail. With all due respect to you both i beg to<br />  differ. I think India still would have been a vibrant economy even<br />  without the British. Maybe it would have taken a bit more time but<br />  it would certainly have happened. There is always this attitude that<br />  without the British we wouldn't have had the railways,command over<br />  the English language,cricket,etc. We would still have done these<br />  things without the British and we would have remained united. The<br />  British made sure when they were leaving that this problem of<br />  religion and partition would haunt us for ever.</p>
<p>      I cant give you any specifics about the "If the British did not<br />  rule India" as this is purely  hypothetical. Do you think a culture<br />  which is as old as ours changed for the better just because of a<br />  minuscule period ruled by the British? Just because you are a<br />  superior nation it does not give you the right to rule over the weak<br />  let alone take their lives. My clients in England still treat this<br />  country as an English colony.</p>
<p>      What happened to us by the British is similar to what is<br />  happening to Iraq by the US. 50 years from now when Iraq has<br />  railways,proper government systems would they be happy that the US<br />  came and conquered them? No! This attitude is prevalent amongst us<br />  Indians,only! I remember reading in a thread before "Indians are the<br />  ONLY countrymen who are not proud about their past"</p>
<p>      Remember what Nelson Mandela said "The problem is not that they<br />  think they are superior the problem we think we are inferior"</p>

<p>    we are still paying for the " indian rule" from 1800 till 1947.and<br />    lets realise its a costly payment.<br />    but for the british we would be like africa. 600 poor states<br />    fighting each other.<br />    thats why films like mangal pandey seem so out of place today.</p>

If<br />  not,<br />    then why<br />      this "fight agains the British" .. or are we just being<br />    politically correct<br />      since we have a number of Indian Muslims (who quite rightly<br />    shouldn't be<br />      held responsible for what some idiots from Afghanistan did a few<br />    centuries<br />      ago).?</p>

<p>          From your mail about Marudhanayagam I have presumed that he<br />    fought<br />        the<br />          British between 1750 and 1780(correct me if i am wrong). If<br />    this<br />        is so then<br />          how come we call the 1857 Mutiny of Sepoys as the First War<br />  of<br />        Independence.<br />          Mangal Pandey was not even angry because they were ill<br />  treating<br />        Indians it<br />          was because they had mislead him into chewing beef. Is this<br />    because<br />          Marudhunayagam was not documented that well?<br />          How many Tamils have fought the British before 1857? Can you<br />    please<br />          elaborate on this?</p>

<p>            a period when the line between a ruler and a robber was<br />  very<br />        thin. a<br />            period when lotsa of non royals became blue blooded ones.<br />            the poligar times is a fantastic political play ground in<br />  the<br />            history of tamilnadu.</p>

<p>              This is really a lot of information about<br />  Marudanayagam!!!<br />              What a fantastic character this man must have been. He<br />  has<br />        been a<br />              Hindu,learnt his 3 R's in a christian household,had an<br />    affair<br />        with<br />            a<br />              Frenchwoman,married a parangi, and converted to Islam.<br />  Has<br />        there<br />            ever been a<br />              more diverse individual? Maybe a complete book in<br />  English<br />    about<br />            this person<br />              would be a best seller. The only way for letting the<br />  world<br />    know<br />            about our<br />              heroes would be to write their memoirs in English and<br />  sell<br />    them<br />            abroad<br />              through a renowned publisher. If only wishes were<br />  horses...<br />              May our fabled land produce more Marudanayagam's</p>

<p>                heres some matter on yusuf khan from the net</p>
<p>                Tradition has many stories to tell of this remarkable<br />    man,<br />        who is<br />                commonly known in Madura as Khansa, an abbrevlation<br />  for<br />    Khan<br />            Sahib.<br />                He was born in the Rammnad country and was originally<br />  a<br />        Hindu of<br />            the<br />                Vellala Caste. He ran away from his home, took Service<br />    under<br />        a<br />                European for three years in pondicherry, was<br />  dismissed,<br />        served<br />            under<br />                another European (who educated him), went to the<br />  Nawab's<br />        court,<br />            rose<br />                rapidly in the army, married a parangi woman and<br />    eventually,<br />        as<br />            has<br />                been seen, became Commandant of all the Company's<br />    sepoys. His<br />                executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the<br />  report<br />        (see<br />                below) from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 and<br />        entitled 'A<br />                view of the English interests in India'--which was<br />        republished in<br />                Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and<br />    Madura 'his<br />        whole<br />                administration denoted vigour and effect. His justice<br />  was<br />                unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were<br />    happily<br />                combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge<br />    from<br />                punishment.' It concludes by saying that his example<br />    shows<br />                that 'wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate<br />  or<br />            complexion.'</p>
<p>                Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />                The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to<br />  the<br />        country,<br />                renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very<br />        moderate<br />            sum<br />                of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of<br />    1759 and<br />            began<br />                by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting<br />    avenues<br />            through<br />                their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they<br />    fled, or<br />                executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners.<br />  He<br />        went on<br />            to<br />                reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had<br />        sobered all<br />                the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He<br />  even<br />        had the<br />                audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without<br />    the<br />            knowledge<br />                or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762,<br />  he<br />            offered to<br />                lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at<br />  seven<br />        lakhs<br />            per<br />                annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was<br />    enraged at<br />            this,<br />                or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy<br />  his<br />            masters--<br />                he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and<br />  began<br />    to<br />            collect<br />                troops.</p>
<p>                He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />                In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against<br />  him<br />    and<br />        he<br />            was<br />                besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly<br />  all<br />        deserted<br />                him, but he held out until October 1764 with great<br />    energy and<br />            skill,<br />                renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense-<br />  -<br />    he is<br />            said<br />                to have 'entirely repaired' its east face and<br />  constantly<br />        employed<br />                3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief<br />  assault<br />        with a<br />                loss of 120 Europeans (including nine officers) killed<br />    and<br />            wounded.<br />                At the end of that time little real progress against<br />  him<br />    had<br />        been<br />                made, except that the place was now rigorously<br />  blockaded,<br />        but he<br />            was<br />                treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in<br />    charge<br />        of<br />            the<br />                French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles<br />        Campbell, who<br />                commanded the English among the besiegers. He was<br />        ignominiously<br />                hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of<br />    Madura,<br />        and<br />            his<br />                body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque was<br />        afterwards<br />                erected over the tomb. It is still in existence--to<br />  the<br />    left<br />        of<br />            the<br />                read to Dindigul, a little beyond the toll-gate--and<br />  is<br />    known<br />                as 'Khan Sahib's pallivasal.'</p>

        <p>Hi all</p>
<p>there are 2 stages in british rule<br />pre 1857 and post 1857<br />east india company and pax brittanica<br />east india company was often led by free booters who did what <br />pleased them<br />the take over by the royal family did wonders for us.<br />even if gandhi had failed in getting us freedom, i feel we would be <br />as developed as australia or new zealand being under the crown.</p>

<p>like British. British played a Monkey role in distributing eatable <br />to poor cats of local kings. Every individual king kept quiet during <br />British rule and ofcourse happy too. Even in TN history we had <br />prosperous during centralised rule of RRC/Kuloththungha but when <br />chola empire weakened everything gone. Still we are praying at the <br />temples of more than 800 years old only.  </p>
<blockquote><p>  But Rahul arguement are little diverted, I feel. Even without <br />the so called help of British we would have had all the modern </p></blockquote>
<p>facilities. We need not compare ourselves with African countries. <br />There was a joke in London (May be Sri knows that) while riding a <br />sardar's taxi, a proud British was castigating the Indian sardar <br />that if no british in India there were no rajabhaattaas (highways), <br />there were no trains like that. The Indian Sardar hit back with the <br />words that everything was laid by British for selfish sake as they <br />wanted a route to export things to British. The highways and trains <br />led to harbours only and take every Indian thing to London (Tea, <br />cotton, tobacco and minerals and ofcourse gold too)</p>
<blockquote><p>  Our Indians are peculiar in nature. They fight each other but <br />when common enemy comes they join together. Recently we have all </p></blockquote>
<p>seen during Kargil war period. We will have to count British also to <br />that extent. And Saint Arvindar who vehemently waged a war against <br />British suddenly got the enlightenment and he shifted his knowledge <br />towards spirituality. Perhaps, he might have told Barathi about the <br />future independent India - perhaps Bharati who had the insight of <br />that feeling and sang 'aaduvOmE paLLu paaduvOmE.. aanandha <br />sudhanthiram adainthu...</p>

<p>without the British. Maybe it would have taken a bit more time but <br />it would certainly have happened. There is always this attitude that <br />without the British we wouldn't have had the railways,command over <br />the English language,cricket,etc. We would still have done these <br />things without the British and we would have remained united. The <br />British made sure when they were leaving that this problem of <br />religion and partition would haunt us for ever. </p>

<p>which is as old as ours changed for the better just because of a <br />minuscule period ruled by the British? Just because you are a <br />superior nation it does not give you the right to rule over the weak <br />let alone take their lives. My clients in England still treat this <br />country as an English colony. </p>

<p>railways,proper government systems would they be happy that the US <br />came and conquered them? No! This attitude is prevalent amongst us <br />Indians,only! I remember reading in a thread before "Indians are the <br />ONLY countrymen who are not proud about their past" </p>

<p>  this is a hatred psychosis imposed on us by our politicians.<br />  hatred towards the brits were the unifying force for the freedom <br />  movement.</p>
<p>  we are still paying for the " indian rule" from 1800 till 1947.and <br />  lets realise its a costly payment.<br />  but for the british we would be like africa. 600 poor states <br />  fighting each other.<br />  thats why films like mangal pandey seem so out of place today.</p>

The only way for letting the <br />world <br />  know<br />          about our<br />            heroes would be to write their memoirs in English and <br />sell <br />  them<br />          abroad<br />            through a renowned publisher.

His<br />              executive ability is sufficiently indicated in the <br />report <br />      (see<br />              below) from Colonel Fullarton - dated March, 1785 and<br />      entitled 'A<br />              view of the English interests in India'--which was<br />      republished in <br />              Madras in1867. This says that in Tinnevelly and <br />  Madura 'his<br />      whole<br />              administration denoted vigour and effect. His justice <br />was<br />              unquestioned, his word unalterable; his measures were <br />  happily<br />              combined and firmly executed, the guilty had no refuge <br />  from<br />              punishment.' It concludes by saying that his example <br />  shows<br />              that 'wisdom, vigour and integrity are of no climate <br />or <br />          complexion.'</p>
<p>              Yusuf Khan again despateched<br />              The Company accordingly sent back Muhammad Yusuf to <br />the <br />      country,<br />              renting both Madura and Tinnevely to him for the very<br />      moderate<br />          sum<br />              of five lakhs annually. He returned in the spring of <br />  1759 and<br />          began<br />              by teaching the Kallans a wholesome lesson. Cutting <br />  avenues<br />          through<br />              their woods, he shot them down without mercy as they <br />  fled, or<br />              executed as malefactors any who were taken prisoners. <br />He<br />      went on<br />          to<br />              reduce the rest of the country to order, and soon had <br />      sobered all<br />              the poligars and made himself extremely powerful. He <br />even<br />      had the<br />              audacity to make war on the king of Travancore without <br />  the<br />          knowledge<br />              or consent of the company. In 1761, and again in 1762, <br />he<br />          offered to<br />              lease Tinnevelly and Madura for four years more at <br />seven <br />      lakhs<br />          per<br />              annum. His offer was refused, and--whether he was <br />  enraged at<br />          this,<br />              or whether he thought himself powerful enough to defy <br />his <br />          masters--<br />              he shortly afterwards threw off his allegiance and <br />began <br />  to<br />          collect<br />              troops.</p>
<p>              He rabels and is hanged, 1764<br />              In 1763, therefore, a strong force was sent against <br />him <br />  and<br />      he<br />          was<br />              besieged in Madura in September. His friends nearly <br />all <br />      deserted<br />              him, but he held out until October 1764 with great <br />  energy and<br />          skill,<br />              renovating and strengthening the fort at great expense-<br />- <br />  he is<br />          said<br />              to have 'entirely repaired' its east face and <br />constantly<br />      employed<br />              3,000 labourers about it--and repelling the chief <br />assault <br />      with a<br />              loss of 120 Europeans (including nine officers) killed <br />  and<br />          wounded.<br />              At the end of that time little real progress against <br />him <br />  had<br />      been<br />              made, except that the place was now rigorously <br />blockaded,<br />      but he<br />          was<br />              treacherously seized by one Marchaud, the officer in <br />  charge<br />      of<br />          the<br />              French contingent, and handed over to Major Charles<br />      Campbell, who<br />              commanded the English among the besiegers. He was <br />      ignominiously<br />              hanged near the camp, about two miles to the west of <br />  Madura,<br />      and<br />          his<br />              body was buried at the spot. A small square mosque was <br />      afterwards<br />              erected over the tomb. It is still in existence--to <br />the <br />  left<br />      of<br />          the<br />              read to Dindigul, a little beyond the toll-gate--and <br />is <br />  known<br />              as 'Khan Sahib's pallivasal.'</p>
