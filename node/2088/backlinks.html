</div></div><!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I am in the process of reading "Udaiyar" by Balakumaran: A historical novel <br />set during Raja Raja's time, dealing with the building of the Periya Koil. <br />In it, Balakumaran creates an impression that Rajendra Chozhan who was <br />located at Kanchi, was unhappy with Raja Raja's shelling out all the money <br />to pay for builders "sirpigaL" etc. He was also unhappy about Sembiyan <br />Madhevi's building of the temple (forget the place). Anyway, I was wondering <br />as to what the other members here think about this assertion. To me, it <br />doesn't look very far fetched. Think of it: A young impetuous Rajendra, <br />wanting to cement his place in history, to go off and fight wars in distant <br />lands comes up against a mellower Raja Raja, who in his latter years wants <br />to devote his life to building the Periya Koil. Generational clash?:-)</p>
<p>Interesting Nevertheless!!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Arun</p>
<p>P. S. I never knew Balakumaran had written historical fictions. I just saw <br />these in the library and picked them up. Hold on.. I think I read another <br />book of his on Arunagirinathar. So maybe he HAS written them and as usual, I <br />am the ignoramus!</p>

          Could Rajendra Chozha have differed over the Building of Periya         </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>On looking at The Great Raja Raja's expeditions. It started from the bottom most part of Thamizhnadu and marched towards North. That is from 'Kandhalur Salai kalamaruththaruli' to 'Irattaipaadi ezharai ilakkamum'.</p>
<p>So fighting with Chalukyas, could have been on his final trails. And this war with Chalukyas, was fought, by noneother than Rajendhra Cholan, with 9 lakh invincible soldiers from Thamizh Naadu. He plundered the entire kingdom and came back with fortunes, women, horses, elephants..etc. But, as Chalukyas were also, powerful, there had been a continues fight between both the kingdoms, for many years after this.</p>
<p>The fortunes, that Rajendhra Cholan, had come back with was spent, for Thanjai Pariya Koil, construction. </p>
<p>But, I guess, by this time, Chola kingdom, should be the richest in India ( world ?), as it covered half of the present India. Though, there were money lost in wars, but, what was gained after conquest, should be much much higher. </p>
<p>Logically, Creation and Contruction of Gangai Konda Chozha Puram, should be much much higher than construction of Periya Koil.</p>
<p>Rajendhra Cholan!</p>

But wouldn't it be interesting to know if there actually were opposition from Rajendra for the Kovil? Maybe some inscriptions somewhere stating that the king diverted some funds earmarked for some campaign etc? Balakumaran goes on to say in the book that Rajendra was annoyed that the King and Sembiyan Madevi were doling out 2-3 times the amount of money/day for artisans as were made by his soldiers. That is actually a distinct possibility what? The soldiers could have been grumbling over this largesse on the part of the King. </drarunkrishnan@gmail.com></p>
<p>What say?:) </p>

<p>I strongly doubt whether RajaRaja was alive when Rajendra wanted to go <br />for the Kadaram expedition. Kadaram expedition happened after Ganges<br />expedition and during Ganges expedition <acronym title="Gangai Konda Cholapuram" GKC</acronym  was made as the captial<br />and was waiting for the Ganges water for inaugration.</acronym></p>
<p>As Rajendra Cholan said, Rajendra didn't try to shift his capital from <br />Thanjavoor when <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan" RR</acronym  was alive. So, it is very unlike that there was<br />difference of opinion between them, during Periya Koil construction.<br />That too, with Kadaram expeditions in mind.</acronym></p>

<p>is, Rajendhra did not shift his Capital from Thanjavoor to Gangai<br />Konda Chozha puram, till Raja Raja was alive. But, I dont have<br />evidence to prove this.</p>

        <p>Well ok, I agree the Kadaram expedition - Periya Koil link is farfetched and <br />it is something I kinda made up on the spot. But wouldn't it be interesting <br />to know if there actually were opposition from Rajendra for the Kovil? Maybe <br />some inscriptions somewhere stating that the king diverted some funds <br />earmarked for some campaign etc? Balakumaran goes on to say in the book that <br />Rajendra was annoyed that the King and Sembiyan Madevi were doling out 2-3 <br />times the amount of money/day for artisans as were made by his soldiers. <br />That is actually a distinct possibility what? The soldiers could have been <br />grumbling over this largesse on the part of the King. </p>

<p>Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@gmail.com  wrote:<br />Dear RajendraChozhan,</drarunkrishnan@gmail.com></p>
<p>Point taken. What I find interesting though is the fact that </p>
<p>A) we can't say for sure that RajaRaja was wholeheartedly in support of Rajendhra's kadaram expedition (or are there sources out there which actually state that?). </p>
<p>B) That being the case, could Rajendra's Kadaram expedition a kind of quid pro quo from Raja Raja, that is, "Ok son.. I will give you money to fight your war if you stop making a fuss about the temple I am building"? I am sure Rajendra and Raja Raja, despite being very close to each other had differences of opinion on how to run an empire.</p>
<p>C) As to Rajendra himself building a Big Temple at Gangaikkonda..., maybe as he got older, he saw what his father had accomplished. And as they say, with age, wisdom dawns. I just find it fascinating that we don't look at history (at least Indian history) from the perspective of relationships.</p>
<p>I mean to say, we deify our heroes, so to us RajaRaja and Rajendra were these super kings. But, they were human too. They had human relationships with people. Given a set of circumstances, I don't think how RajaRaja or Rajendra responded to them would be too different from say how you or I would respond. I doubt if human behaviour has changed all that much over time. :)</p>

<p>During, Uthama Cholan's period, Even Raja Raja's hands were tied, but when he ascended the throne, infact many wars were won by Rajendhra, under the name, Panchavan Maarayan, (If I remember correctly, else, help me on this.)</p>
<p>I would rather say, Raja Raja gave a full freedom to his son on War Campains. But, war expetition against Kadaaram, was different. The reason for the war, is not quite clear, and even Dr.Raasamanikanar assumes that, Rajendhra went this far to protect the intrest of Tamils living in Kadaaram. As the place was flourishing with trade, Tamils and Chinese, were doing lots of business. Kadaaram could not pose threat to the Great Chola Kingdom. </p>

<p>Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@gmail.com  wrote:<br />Dear Sri,</drarunkrishnan@gmail.com></p>
<p>Ok.. here is my Scenario (or rather Balakumaran's). </p>
<p>Raja Raja, when he decides to build the Periya Kovil is fairly advanced in age. At the same time, Rajendra who has had to possibly live longer in the shadow of his illustrious father (due to the whole Uttama Chozha episode), is chomping on the <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym . He wants to go out and conquer far lands, to build his own reputation. He gets irritated that his father is pumping in the money that he would like to use for his military campaigns, to building this temple. It is a quite natural sequence of events isn't it? </p>

<p>Arun Krishnan <drarunkrishnan@gmail.com  wrote:<br />Dear All,</drarunkrishnan@gmail.com></p>
<p>I am in the process of reading "Udaiyar" by Balakumaran: A historical novel set during Raja Raja's time, dealing with the building of the Periya Koil. In it, Balakumaran creates an impression that Rajendra Chozhan who was located at Kanchi, was unhappy with Raja Raja's shelling out all the money to pay for builders "sirpigaL" etc. He was also unhappy about Sembiyan Madhevi's building of the temple (forget the place). Anyway, I was wondering as to what the other members here think about this assertion. To me, it doesn't look very far fetched. Think of it: A young impetuous Rajendra, wanting to cement his place in history, to go off and fight wars in distant lands comes up against a mellower Raja Raja, who in his latter years wants to devote his life to building the Periya Koil. Generational clash?:-)</p>
<p>Interesting Nevertheless!!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Arun</p>
<p>P. S. I never knew Balakumaran had written historical fictions. I just saw these in the library and picked them up. Hold on.. I think I read another book of his on Arunagirinathar. So maybe he HAS written them and as usual, I am the ignoramus!</p>

          Could Rajendra Chozha have differed over the Building of Periya         </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear RajendraChozhan,</p>
<p>Point taken. What I find interesting though is the fact that </p>
<p>A) we can't say for sure that RajaRaja was wholeheartedly in support of <br />Rajendhra's kadaram expedition (or are there sources out there which <br />actually state that?). </p>
<p>B) That being the case, could Rajendra's Kadaram expedition a kind of quid <br />pro quo from Raja Raja, that is, "Ok son.. I will give you money to fight <br />your war if you stop making a fuss about the temple I am building"? I am <br />sure Rajendra and Raja Raja, despite being very close to each other had <br />differences of opinion on how to run an empire.</p>
<p>C) As to Rajendra himself building a Big Temple at Gangaikkonda..., maybe as <br />he got older, he saw what his father had accomplished. And as they say, with <br />age, wisdom dawns. I just find it fascinating that we don't look at history <br />(at least Indian history) from the perspective of relationships.</p>
<p>I mean to say, we deify our heroes, so to us RajaRaja and Rajendra were <br />these super kings. But, they were human too. They had human relationships <br />with people. Given a set of circumstances, I don't think how RajaRaja or <br />Rajendra responded to them would be too different from say how you or I <br />would respond. I doubt if human behaviour has changed all that much over <br />time. :)</p>

<p>  Dear Sri,</p>
<p>  Ok.. here is my Scenario (or rather Balakumaran's). </p>
<p>  Raja Raja, when he decides to build the Periya Kovil is fairly advanced in <br />  age. At the same time, Rajendra who has had to possibly live longer in the <br />  shadow of his illustrious father (due to the whole Uttama Chozha episode), <br />  is chomping on the bit. He wants to go out and conquer far lands, to build <br />  his own reputation. He gets irritated that his father is pumping in the <br />  money that he would like to use for his military campaigns, to building this <br />  temple. It is a quite natural sequence of events isn't it? </p>

<p>    Dear All,</p>
<p>    I am in the process of reading "Udaiyar" by Balakumaran: A historical <br />    novel set during Raja Raja's time, dealing with the building of the Periya <br />    Koil. In it, Balakumaran creates an impression that Rajendra Chozhan who was <br />    located at Kanchi, was unhappy with Raja Raja's shelling out all the money <br />    to pay for builders "sirpigaL" etc. He was also unhappy about Sembiyan <br />    Madhevi's building of the temple (forget the place). Anyway, I was wondering <br />    as to what the other members here think about this assertion. To me, it <br />    doesn't look very far fetched. Think of it: A young impetuous Rajendra, <br />    wanting to cement his place in history, to go off and fight wars in distant <br />    lands comes up against a mellower Raja Raja, who in his latter years wants <br />    to devote his life to building the Periya Koil. Generational clash?:-)</p>
<p>    Interesting Nevertheless!!</p>
<p>    Cheers,</p>
<p>    Arun</p>
<p>    P. S. I never knew Balakumaran had written historical fictions. I just <br />    saw these in the library and picked them up. Hold on.. I think I read <br />    another book of his on Arunagirinathar. So maybe he HAS written them and as <br />    usual, I am the ignoramus!</p>

          Could Rajendra Chozha have differed over the Building of Periya         </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Sri,</p>
<p>Ok.. here is my Scenario (or rather Balakumaran's). </p>
<p>Raja Raja, when he decides to build the Periya Kovil is fairly advanced in <br />age. At the same time, Rajendra who has had to possibly live longer in the <br />shadow of his illustrious father (due to the whole Uttama Chozha episode), <br />is chomping on the <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology" BIT</acronym . He wants to go out and conquer far lands, to build <br />his own reputation. He gets irritated that his father is pumping in the <br />money that he would like to use for his military campaigns, to building this <br />temple. It is a quite natural sequence of events isn't it? </acronym></p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Arun</p>

<p>  Dear All,</p>
<p>  I am in the process of reading "Udaiyar" by Balakumaran: A historical <br />  novel set during Raja Raja's time, dealing with the building of the Periya <br />  Koil. In it, Balakumaran creates an impression that Rajendra Chozhan who was <br />  located at Kanchi, was unhappy with Raja Raja's shelling out all the money <br />  to pay for builders "sirpigaL" etc. He was also unhappy about Sembiyan <br />  Madhevi's building of the temple (forget the place). Anyway, I was wondering <br />  as to what the other members here think about this assertion. To me, it <br />  doesn't look very far fetched. Think of it: A young impetuous Rajendra, <br />  wanting to cement his place in history, to go off and fight wars in distant <br />  lands comes up against a mellower Raja Raja, who in his latter years wants <br />  to devote his life to building the Periya Koil. Generational clash?:-)</p>
<p>  Interesting Nevertheless!!</p>
<p>  Cheers,</p>
<p>  Arun</p>
<p>  P. S. I never knew Balakumaran had written historical fictions. I just saw <br />  these in the library and picked them up. Hold on.. I think I read another <br />  book of his on Arunagirinathar. So maybe he HAS written them and as usual, I <br />  am the ignoramus!</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Imperail Cholas, had been devotees of the Great God Shiva, right from the days of Vijayalaya Cholan, or right from the days of Kochengatcholan or may be even before. </p>
<p>When Great King Raja Raja, ascended the throne, he was not young, as he witnessed the rule of Sundara Cholan, Adhithya Karikaalam ( not as King, ofcourse ) and Uthama Cholan. And hence If Raja Raja had consctructed the Periya Kovil, few years after his attainment as a king, I doubt the chances that Rajendhra was a even a youth. </p>
<p>Even Rajendhra was old enough, when he became the king.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had been brought up by his Athai Kundhavai and Sembiyan Maadevi in Pazhayaarai aranmanai. Both of them as ardent devotees of Great God Shiva. </p>
<p>So, I doubt, whether, Rajendhra could have had those thought against constructing the Periya Koil.</p>

<p>  Dear All,</p>
<p>  I am in the process of reading "Udaiyar" by Balakumaran: A historical <br />  novel set during Raja Raja's time, dealing with the building of the Periya <br />  Koil. In it, Balakumaran creates an impression that Rajendra Chozhan who was <br />  located at Kanchi, was unhappy with Raja Raja's shelling out all the money <br />  to pay for builders "sirpigaL" etc. He was also unhappy about Sembiyan <br />  Madhevi's building of the temple (forget the place). Anyway, I was wondering <br />  as to what the other members here think about this assertion. To me, it <br />  doesn't look very far fetched. Think of it: A young impetuous Rajendra, <br />  wanting to cement his place in history, to go off and fight wars in distant <br />  lands comes up against a mellower Raja Raja, who in his latter years wants <br />  to devote his life to building the Periya Koil. Generational clash?:-)</p>
<p>  Interesting Nevertheless!!</p>
<p>  Cheers,</p>
<p>  Arun</p>
<p>  P. S. I never knew Balakumaran had written historical fictions. I just saw <br />  these in the library and picked them up. Hold on.. I think I read another <br />  book of his on Arunagirinathar. So maybe he HAS written them and as usual, I <br />  am the ignoramus!</p>
