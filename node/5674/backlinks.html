<p>Woodlands is one of the places I felt as if I am not in Chennai. I<br />also think it is the favorite place for many of you. It was shock to<br />see me that the place has been taken over by the government and going<br />to get converted in to some garden. Such a shame, such a place is<br />going to go.</p>

<p>my god, you have an excellent memory....not good for me. anyway <br />there were a few of these spots...where you could get lost inside <br />chennai...<br />apart from those listed above</p>
<p>the adyar river mouth ( broken bridge) - walk along oorur alcott <br />kuppam side from elliots beach to this place.</p>
<p>the muthukkadu sand bund ( just after mgm) you will see a nice drop <br />( before the bridge) - a lone palm tree standing - and then the <br />water edge - you can keep walking along the water side cross over in <br />knee deep water to the sand bund...poor mans mauritius</p>
<p>of course <acronym title="Indian Instittue of Technology" IIT</acronym  campus -it was a lovely sight - we used to have the <br />league soccer and hockey games inside the campus and it was a <br />spectacular sight to have the games interrupted by deers .....</acronym></p>
<p>on the other side of town - post old fishing harbour - manali side -<br />a among the crashing waves on the storm protection stones .... </p>
<p>pallavaram - butt grounds - well not a seculded place - but a haven <br />for cricket enthusiasts ( we used to have similar near the ayyapan <br />kovil /chettinad school ) just after the state bank traning centre - <br />every inch of available space would be occupied by budding <br />tendulkars and dravids - infact the stumps were dual -meaning you <br />would have two teams playing ( batsmen on either side of the <br />stumps) - with about thousand boys playing - it was amazing how the <br />fielders would still stay focussed and the game would go on....there <br />was another two grounds - abutting the airport road belonging to the <br />army...</p>
<p>for the lucky few who had their ` friends ' but unlucky enough to <br />have parents who wouldnt give them any pocket money - there was <br />always nageswara rao park, snake park and children park, well lets <br />call all parks, valluvar kottam.....alsa mall ( now place taken by <br />spencers)...madras university canteen...</p>
<p>now you know, the amount of time that was left for productive <br />pursuits....</p>

        <p>I had no idea Madhan was part of the old journalist<br />team. I agree completely that Cho rarely 'blends in'<br />anywhere, so perhaps that is a wise decision only.</p>
<p>I disagree though that he was any genius. He was and<br />is an intelligent man, more intelligent than others<br />around him and has a very good flair for timely<br />comedy. He is a good political satirist and knows many<br />times how political events turn out so perhaps that is<br />why people think he is 'genius'. I used to like him a<br />lot, of late have lost much of respect.</p>

<p>      Like 75 years of Tamil movies story, If there<br />  is<br />      already a detailed <br />      study (link) on .... yrs of Tamil fictions, it<br />  will<br />      be a feast..</p>

<p>      IDHAYAM PESUGIRATHU - with this Very Caption -<br />      MANIAN has opened up <br />      another YOUTHFUL AVENUE in Tamil Story telling<br />      pattern .. taking cue <br />      from Popular Tamil Songs ..</p>
<p>      Apart from this he paved way for a couple of<br />  things<br />      more..</p>
<p>      FORERUNNER in Promoting RELIGEOUS MAGAZINE ..<br />  GNANA<br />      BHOOMI !!</p>
<p>      This is the Mother for Sakthi Vikadan, Kumudham<br />      Bakthi etc.,</p>
<p>      AND as you rightly pointed out TRAVELLOGUES ..</p>

<p>      His association with MGR (with PRO Chitra<br />      Krishaswamy - probably) <br />      might have triggered this.. yet he shared his<br />  vast<br />      experience with <br />      the Tamil world.</p>
<p>      With his association with Bala Jothidar,<br />  ASTROLOGY<br />      details were also <br />      putforward widely through Tamil print media.</p>
<p>      (Otherwise INDIAN EXPRESS - Peter Vidal coloumns<br />      were the only <br />      solace !)</p>
<p>      So, when respected member SEETHALAKSHMI MADAM is<br />  in<br />      Chennai (by <br />      June - July), we will have a meeting and request<br />  to<br />      share with us <br />      HER MALARUM NINAIVUGAL ... ! </p>
<p>      (Malargalile aval malligai was one of the<br />  Fictions<br />      of Manian )</p>
<p>      And we will invite Mrs. PUNITHAVATHI ELANGOVAN,<br />      TRICHY A.I.R, close <br />      friend of Madam Seethalakshmi to share her<br />  details<br />      on PS Radio <br />      drama. Her son only enacted PS Stage Drama.<br />      Obviously he will be <br />      the Guest of Honour.. And our Vikraman ...</p>

<p>Since you mentioned old journalists I would suggest<br />add the ageing Cho Sir? Manian and Saavi on two sides<br />with Cho in the middle was sort of the magazine scene<br />in the 70s and 80s. Cho still has his razor sharp wit<br />and political satire, although over age he has also<br />become very emotional, taking sides and giving quick<br />statements. But his contribution to keeping<br />bhakti/tradition alive and much needed critical<br />outlook on politics is very important (I think).</p>

<p>  Atleast since Kalki (1950 ), the almost 60 years<br />  Fiction - story is <br />  well dotted with stalwarts ..</p>
<p>  IDHAYAM PESUGIRATHU - with this Very Caption -<br />  MANIAN has opened up <br />  another YOUTHFUL AVENUE in Tamil Story telling<br />  pattern .. taking cue <br />  from Popular Tamil Songs ..</p>
<p>  Apart from this he paved way for a couple of things<br />  more..</p>
<p>  FORERUNNER in Promoting RELIGEOUS MAGAZINE .. GNANA<br />  BHOOMI !!</p>
<p>  This is the Mother for Sakthi Vikadan, Kumudham<br />  Bakthi etc.,</p>
<p>  AND as you rightly pointed out TRAVELLOGUES ..</p>
<p>  Bharanidharan covered places of religeous<br />  important.. (domestic - <br />  mostly).</p>
<p>  After VASHINGTONIL THIRUMANAM by Saavi (hilarious<br />  comedy), MANIAN <br />  was the PIONEER ( and with him it almost ended ) in<br />  bringing out <br />  descritive details of other Nations..</p>
<p>  His association with MGR (with PRO Chitra<br />  Krishaswamy - probably) <br />  might have triggered this.. yet he shared his vast<br />  experience with <br />  the Tamil world.</p>
<p>  With his association with Bala Jothidar, ASTROLOGY<br />  details were also <br />  putforward widely through Tamil print media.</p>
<p>  (Otherwise INDIAN EXPRESS - Peter Vidal coloumns<br />  were the only <br />  solace !)</p>
<p>  So, when respected member SEETHALAKSHMI MADAM is in<br />  Chennai (by <br />  June - July), we will have a meeting and request to<br />  share with us <br />  HER MALARUM NINAIVUGAL ... ! </p>
<p>  (Malargalile aval malligai was one of the Fictions<br />  of Manian )</p>
<p>  And we will invite Mrs. PUNITHAVATHI ELANGOVAN,<br />  TRICHY A.I.R, close <br />  friend of Madam Seethalakshmi to share her details<br />  on PS Radio <br />  drama. Her son only enacted PS Stage Drama.<br />  Obviously he will be <br />  the Guest of Honour.. And our Vikraman ...</p>

        <p>Yes, the rivalry between these two journalists was<br />really boosting magazine sales then. To more<br />intelligent readers used to Kalki and the outspoken<br />magazine tradition it was shameful outright 'kakka<br />pidikkal'. Both Saavi and Manian were good<br />journalists, intelligent men, it was very sad to see<br />them become such brown nosers (as they call kakka<br />pidikkal in this country).</p>

<p>          Woodlands is one of the places I felt as if<br />  I<br />    am not in <br />    Chennai. I<br />          also think it is the favorite place for many<br />    of you.

        <p>I bought a book for my father last time called Madras,<br />An architectural heritage - it is out of print and I<br />paid a good sum of money to get it from indiaclub.com.</p>
<p>The book has several pictures and stories about<br />buildings in old chennai - many of whom are on their<br />way to destruction and many are gone. My father got<br />very emotional and sentimental on reading it and is<br />still reading it.</p>
<p>It is truly a pity. Yes the woodlands was the<br />'honeymooning' spot for so many couples who could not<br />afford anything better. Till her last days my mother<br />was teased mercilessly about her 'honeymooon' which<br />was a vada and coffee at woodlands with my father,<br />away from the many old people at home :)) </p>

<p>    Woodlands is one of the places I felt as if I am<br />  not in Chennai. I<br />    also think it is the favorite place for many of<br />  you. It was shock to<br />    see me that the place has been taken over by the<br />  government and going<br />    to get converted in to some garden.
