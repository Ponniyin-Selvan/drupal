<p>Now, on the 150th anniversary of the conclusion of the American Civil War,<br />we are fleshing the bare outline of the life of Conjee Rustumjee Cohoujee<br />Bey from the National Archives, Naval Service Records, San Francisco Call<br />newspaper database, Civil War researchers, and, most importantly, the<br />personal letters and diary of his friend and mentor Henry Ward Beecher,<br />pastor of the historic Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn and<br />brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of the American classic Uncle<br />Tom's Cabin.</p>
<p>A contemporary of Mark Twain, Andrew Carnegie, Swami Vivekananda, and<br />Ramakrishna Paramahansa, this Indian American hero's life stretched across<br />three continents, from Lahore to London to San Francisco. At age 12, his<br />parents sent him to England to be educated. In the year 1860, and at age 24,<br />he arrived in New York, full of the spirit of adventure. And towards the<br />final years of his life he lost all his material possessions when his home<br />was gutted by fire in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but the family<br />survived.</p>
<p>But first a background to those times.</p>
<p>To begin with, 1860 was when slavery was alive and well in the land; Abraham<br />Lincoln had just been elected President, even as the nation was hurtling<br />towards Civil War between the Union States in the North and the Confederates<br />in the South. In California, the Gold Rush was tapering off, even as San<br />Francisco was bursting at the seams with adventurers. About 50,000 Chinese<br />and the Japanese had already established a foothold in Calfornia. South<br />Asians had not yet appeared on the scene.</p>
<p>Worldwide, it was also a period when, as a result of the abolition of<br />slavery, Indian indentured laborers were being actively recruited for Fiji,<br />the Caribbean, Mauritius, and South Africa. And with the Sepoy Mutiny in<br />India crushed, the last Mughal Emperor was forced into exile.</p>
<p>HENRY WARD BEECHER</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Brooklyn, the Plymouth Congregational Church, located at the<br />corner of Orange and Hicks Street, was enjoying the most influential pulpit<br />in the land. It was here that the scion of the country's most prominent<br />evangelical family, the Rev Henry Ward Beecher (1813-1887) was bold enough<br />to claim that slavery in America was much worse than the caste system in<br />India. As pastor, Beecher's preaching was characterized by "originality,<br />logic, pathos, and humor," in the words of a contemporary. He preached and<br />Brooklyn, Beecher made it plain that one cornerstone of his ministry at<br />Plymouth would be his opposition to slavery, and, in the early days of the<br />Civil War, Beecher pressed President Lincoln to issue a proclamation of<br />emancipation.</p>
<p>Beecher came from a very long line of religious thinkers and distinguished<br />Americans; he was born with religion in his veins. His father Lyman Beecher<br />was a theologian and head of Lane Theological Seminary. All of his brothers<br />became ministers and three of his sisters enjoyed careers as popular<br />authors. One of his sisters was Harriet Beecher Stowe author of the classic<br />Uncle Tom's Cabin. His articles and sermons were being published both<br />nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>In short, Henry Ward Beecher exercised his influence on many of the major<br />social issues of the mid to late nineteenth century from his pulpit in<br />Brooklyn. Under his leadership, Plymouth Church adopted missions to befriend<br />and help newly arrived immigrants. That's how the Indian prince found<br />himself attending the service at Plymouth and hearing a man who would later<br />be eulogized as the greatest preacher of his time.</p>
<p>For the purpose of our story, Henry Beecher takes on a pivotal role because<br />it was his family that befriended the Indian prince, later converting him to<br />Christianity and renaming him Anthony Frank Gomez. In the course of next two<br />years, the Indian prince not only learned about Christianity from Beecher<br />but went on to become his prot?g?. He was a regular visitor to the Beecher<br />household. He became an avid reader. He listened as Beecher preached against<br />slavery, for political candidates, women's rights, evolution, and his own<br />idea of romantic Christianity that recognized God's love for man and the<br />availability of salvation for all. He engaged in intellectual discourse with<br />the Beecher sisters.</p>
<p>Gomez, the scion of an Indian princely family, was at ease in that elite<br />company. His British education, aristocratic bearing, and close links with<br />the Beecher family, endeared him with major New York figures of the day, a<br />group that included abolitionists, writers, and social theorists, as well as<br />national and international personalities.</p>
<p>Nineteenth century Brooklyn was a young and expanding city. Brooklyn had<br />gained prominence as a major port of trade, with docks and storage<br />facilities lining the East River shore, and a busy shipbuilding yard, the<br />Brooklyn Navy Yard. The growing population, coupled with the annexations of<br />the nearby towns made Brooklyn the third largest city in the nation by 1860.</p>
<p>Beecher devoted much of his time to literary pursuits as a regular<br />contributor to a number of newspapers. He edited the New York Independent,<br />and later founded and edited the Christian Union. His many lectures on life,<br />art, literature, moral philosophy, and politics were published.</p>
<p>But it was in the speaker's podium that Beecher was seen at his best.<br />Enthusiasm, imaginative insight, a strong interest in his fellow man, ready<br />wit, and mastery over the English tongue produced a convincing eloquence.<br />Although remembered today for his social activism, in his own time Beecher<br />was always, foremost, a minister of the Christian gospel. Indeed, during the<br />two years that Gomez spent in Brooklyn he was encouraged to study for the<br />ministry. He was urged to commence formal studies at Lane Theological<br />Seminary in Cincinnati where the elder Beecher was a professor.</p>
<p>But far more powerful and insistent was Abraham Lincoln's call for service<br />to the nation. A year after the Civil War commenced, Gomez walked into the<br />Navy recruiting office at the Brooklyn Naval Yard and volunteered his<br />service aboard the USS North Carolina. He was assigned as a Ward Room<br />Steward and his name was entered as Antonio Francisco Gomez.</p>
<p>CIVIL WAR SERVICE</p>
<p>In 1830s, the USS North Carolina was one of the "nine ships to rate not less<br />than 74 guns each" in the US Navy. Considered by many to be the most<br />powerful naval vessel then afloat, North Carolina served to open ports in<br />the Mediterranean to American traders.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Republic, as today, a display of naval might<br />brought a nation prestige and enhanced her commerce. North Carolina<br />protected the important American commerce of the eastern Pacific until March<br />1839. Since her great size made her less flexible than smaller ships, she<br />returned in 1860 to the Brooklyn Naval Yard which employed about 6000<br />personnel.</p>
<p>This is where the 26-year old Antonio Gomez answered the call of President<br />Lincoln, and began his service in the US Navy: aboard the USS North Carolina<br />at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, on 8 February 1862, as Ward Room Steward.</p>
<p>His next assignment was with the steam sloop USS Dacotah. Gomez was on board<br />when she served in the waters around Hampton Roads. Assigned to the James<br />River Flotilla, she had several skirmishes with the Confederates including<br />those in which a company of her sailors destroyed a Confederate battery of<br />11 guns at Harden's Bluff, Virginia, on 2 July, and one of 15 guns at Day's<br />Point, Virginia, the next day. She joined the blockading forces off<br />Wilmington, North Carolina, on 8 December and served there until 11 June<br />1863 when she was ordered into quarantine at New York the next month when<br />several cases of smallpox were discovered on board.</p>
<p>While serving aboard the first USS Iroquois, a sloop of war in the United<br />States Navy, Gomez saw action at the mouth of the Mississippi River, where<br />she prepared for attack on New Orleans, Louisiana. On 24th April 1864, under<br />Captain Henry H. Bell, Iroquois moved abreast the Forts Jackson and St.<br />Philip, guarding New Orleans, and, after a spirited engagement, helped<br />capture the South's largest and wealthiest city, and key to the Mississippi<br />Valley. It turned out to be Gomez's finest first hand battle encounter which<br />he would relate in letters to Beecher that are preserved at the Billy Graham<br />Center Archives, Wheaton, Illinois, under Ephemera of Henry Ward Beecher -<br />Collection 128.</p>
<p>According to Muster Rolls dated December 1864, Gomez was on assignment as an<br />Officer's Steward aboard the frigate USS Niagara, when it steamed from New<br />York on June 1864 to watch over Confederate warships then fitting out in<br />Europe. She reached her base, Antwerp, and from there roved the English<br />Channel, the French Atlantic Coast and the Bay of Biscay. On 15 August she<br />took Georgia, a former Confederate warship, off Portugal, and continued<br />further combat exercises before returning to her home base.</p>
<p>Just as the Civil War drew to a close, Beecher was the main speaker when the<br />Stars and Stripes were again raised at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, site of<br />the war's first battle. The private papers and personal correspondence of<br />Henry Beecher reveal that Gomez was present on that occasion when the Union<br />victory resulted in a grand celebration in the former "cradle of secession."<br />On April 14, 1865, Union officers and dignitaries gathered at Ft. Sumter. A<br />band played, several nearby Navy warships, including the Niagara on which<br />Gomez was serving, fired salutes, and there were hymns and prayers as the<br />Union flag was transformed into a symbol of a restored and victorious United<br />States.</p>
<p>The ceremony was of most intense interest. Charleston Harbor was filled with<br />Uncle Sam's vessels covered with holiday flags. Great crowds thronged Fort<br />Sumter. Beecher delivered the oration: "On this solemn and joyful day, we<br />again lift to the breeze our fathers' flag, now, again, the banner of the<br />United States, with the fervent prayer that God would crown it with honor,<br />protect it from treason, and send it down to our children.... Terrible in<br />battle, may it be beneficent in peace [and] as long as the sun endures, or<br />the stars, may it wave over a nation neither enslaved nor enslaving.... We<br />lift up our banner, and dedicate it to peace, Union, and liberty, now and<br />forevermore." The crowd responded with great applause.</p>
<p>That night, fireworks brightened the skies over Charleston harbor. Almost<br />five hundred miles to the north, President Lincoln went with his wife to<br />Ford's Theatre for the last time.</p>
<p>LIFE IN SAN FRANCISCO</p>
<p>After spending some time at the Beecher's summer home in Peekskill, New<br />York, Gomez decided to make his home in the West Coast, becoming one of the<br />earliest South Asians to settle and raise a family in San Francisco.</p>
<p>That was in 1867. Five years later, the list of voters published in the San<br />Francisco Call database, listed three persons who were born in India: Edward<br />Doyle, Daniel Warren Poor, and George Farquhar. We are not certain if they<br />were natives of India or Europeans who were born in India. Gomez's name had<br />not yet entered the list. But we do have evidence from the San Francisco<br />Call database that his marriage to Ann Vass took place in 1869 and that<br />their daughter Catherine was born in 1890.</p>
<p>By the turn of the century, when Swami Vivekananda arrived in San Francisco,<br />it was a cosmopolitan, urbane city, full of vigorous life and variety. With<br />a population little less than 350,000 it was the undisputed business and<br />cultural center of the western U.S. The city may have presented an<br />architecturally drab appearance but its natural setting was nothing less<br />than stunning. To the North and East lay its wide Bay jewelled by islands<br />and surrounded by golden hills that turned emerald in spring; to the west<br />lay the Pacific Ocean and to the south the gentle hills of the Peninsula.</p>
<p>Then, as now, the fog that rolled into the city from the Pacific gave a<br />mysterious charm. The landmarks were there: Cliff House where one could<br />watch sea lions lolling on Seal Rock, Golden Gate Park with the romantic<br />Stow Lake, the gardens of Sutro Heights, the forested Presidio, the<br />enchanted foreign enclaves of Little Italy, Little Mexico and mysterious<br />Chinatown. Flower stalls graced almost every downtown street corner with a<br />riot of color. The jaunty cable cars fearlessly ascended and descended the<br />steep hills, the fishing boats, the sedate ferries, the tall masted ships<br />and steamboats lying at dock along the Embarcadero or sailing through the<br />Golden Gate (the bridge came only in the 1930s).</p>
<p>San Francisco was lighthearted. It also had scholarship with access to<br />prestigious universities: UC Berkeley and Stanford down the Peninsula. There<br />were well-stocked bookstores, literary societies. San Francisco was proud to<br />be free from the tensions of the East Coast, from the oppressive narrowness<br />of the Midwest and free too from the straining ambitions of Southern<br />California. The people here were seeking beyond the orthodox or even liberal<br />forms of Christianity for deeper answers to even deeper questions and needs.</p>
<p>It was to this San Francisco that Vivekananda came to lecture Friday evening<br />23rd evening February 1899 at Golden Gate Hall, 625 Sutter Street; subject,<br />"The ideal of a Universal religion"; admission 50C; tickets on sale at<br />Sherman Clays, corner Sutter &amp; Kearney. We can only speculate whether Conjee<br />R.C. Bey, alias Antonio F. Gomez, went to have a glimpse of his countryman<br />and to hear him speak.</p>
<p>At the time, and after his marriage to Ann Vass in 1869, Gomez made his home<br />at 1613 Gough Street. There the couple raised their only child, Catherine.<br />In the year following Ann's death in 1888, Gomez, then 52 years, married<br />Suzanne Dutreux aged 18 at the Grace Episcopal Church in San Francisco. The<br />couple had a son Frank (born 1891), and two daughters (born 1893 and 1898).</p>
<p>For 44 years Gomez worked for the Navy Pay Office in downtown San Francisco.</p>
<p>Newspapers have always played an important role in genealogical research. In<br />the case of the Gomez family in San Francisco, California, this role becomes<br />even more important because of the devastating earthquake of April 18, 1906<br />and the subsequent fires that engulfed the core of the city.</p>
<p>By the time the fires had been extinguished, leaving another $400,000,000 in<br />losses, most of the city had been destroyed including the government<br />buildings. The loss included nearly all of the public records held by the<br />San Francisco city / county government --- land records, vital statistics,<br />court records, and so on. Because of this great loss to the records of San<br />Francisco, the newspaper accounts of events become the key to finding<br />genealogical information.</p>
<p>The Gomez residence at the corner of Bush and Gough on 1613 Gough Street was<br />among those that were gutted in the fire. All family memorabilia, letters<br />and documents were irretrievably lost. Within walking distance of Lafayette<br />Park, the site is now home to Next Stage Theater and the Trinity Episcopal<br />Church.</p>
<p>The Gomez family moved to 2622 Gough Street in late 1906 and remained there<br />until Anthony Frank Gomez alias Conjee Rustumjee Cohoujee Bey contracted<br />"Lobar Pneumonia" and died of cardiac failure on February 17, 1911. His wife<br />Suzanne and their four children survived Gomez.</p>
<p>The Indian American hero received full military honors on 19th February when<br />he was buried in the National Cemetery in the Presidio in San Francisco.</p>
